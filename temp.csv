Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin, which is made by Bharat Biotech, has been found to effectively neutralise the double mutant strain, B.1.617, of SARS-CoV-2 and other variants, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said.

Dr Samiran Panda, chief of epidemiology and communicable diseases division of ICMR, said it is good news and hoped that there will be less anxiety among people in the second wave with this new information about the vaccine. Covaxin has been found to effectively neutralise the double mutant strain also apart from other variants of concern, Dr Panda said.

At ICMR-National Institute of Virology, scientists said they have isolated and cultured the double mutant strain which has E484Q and L452R mutations. They have also isolated and cultured all variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 virus: B.1.1.7 (UK variant); B.1.1.28.2 (Brazil variant) and B.1.351 (South African variant), the scientists said.

ICMR scientists said the NIV has demonstrated the neutralisation potential of Covaxin against the UK variant and Brazil variant. The data for the South African variant is being generated. Recently, ICMR-NIV successfully isolated and cultured the double mutant strain B.1.617 (E484Q and L452R) prevalent in certain regions of India.

Bharat Biotech also tweeted that with the accelerated Phase 3 vaccination schedule starting on May 1, it is essential to know the answers to vaccine efficacy and listed details in their blog.","Far from hospital corridors, the oxygen crisis in the national capital also played out in the corridors of power as Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh traded charges over supply of oxygen to hospitals in the city.

The Delhi government, which had until Tuesday been accusing Uttar Pradesh of curbing supply of oxygen to the capital, was on Wednesday accused by Haryana of stealing oxygen from a tanker.

Haryana health minister Anil Vij said the tanker was on its way to supply oxygen to hospitals in Faridabad. To avoid a repeat of such an incident, Vij said he had issued instructions that all tankers carrying oxygen across Haryana would be escorted by state police force.

“I came to know that the tanker was stopped by certain people in Delhi yesterday, while it was on its way to Faridabad for distributing oxygen to certain hospitals. If the governments forcibly start stealing oxygen like this, it will lead to chaos. It is highly condemnable,” he said in a video.

Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia responded: “Delhi does not have any oxygen plant so the allegation that we looted their truck is baseless… There is a problem in bringing oxygen to Delhi. I was reading a report which said that the reason for limited supply of oxygen in many hospitals in Delhi today was because the oxygen that was earmarked for Delhi from a plant in Faridabad was monopolised and directed towards Haryana by an official from the Haryana government.”

He added: “When the central government has to decide on the quota of oxygen for each state, then state governments should not come in between and hoard oxygen. Similar ordeal took place yesterday in a plant near Modi Nagar (Ghaziabad) when we had to call a senior central government minister. It was only after his help that the oxygen supply reached Delhi. I plead to the Centre to ensure that state governments don’t take undue monopoly over oxygen and make sure this does not become a fight between state governments,” he said.

During the day, hospitals in Delhi said that Linde India Limited, which supplies oxygen to them from their Faridabad plant, had been stopped by the Haryana government from supplying oxygen outside the state. Senior Delhi government officials echoed this allegation, claiming that Faridabad Deputy Commissioner Garima Mittal had stopped oxygen from the plant.

Mittal, however, denied the allegations: “We have not stopped any suppliers from providing oxygen to Delhi, or stopped any vehicles engaged in this. We have received no such orders.”

By evening, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal shared some reassuring news, tweeting: “Central government has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We are very grateful to centre for this.”

According to officials, Delhi was getting 378 metric tonnes of oxygen till Wednesday afternoon, which has now been increased to 480 metric tonnes. The Delhi government had asked for the allocation to be increased to 700 metric tonnes.","Covid-19 testing on full swing in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)

Coronavirus India Live Updates: Amid the ongoing spat among different over the transport of oxygen supplies, the Delhi High Court Wednesday directed the Centre to ensure safe passage of oxygen supplies from the place of production to place of delivery throughout the country.



The Union Health Ministry Wednesday said about 0.04 per cent people tested positive after the second dose of Covaxin and 0.03 per cent after the second dose of Covishield. The ministry also said those below 10 years of age, 4.03 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 2.97 per cent cases registered in the second wave.

At least 22 Covid patients have died at Zakir Husain Hospital in Nashik after an oxygen tanker leaked, shutting down supply. District officials said they tried to divert jumbo and smaller cylinders for patients but they depended largely on the storage tanker for oxygen supply where the leakage was reported.

In the biggest daily increase yet, India reported 2.95 lakh cases of the novel coronavirus and 2,023 deaths in the 24 hours ending 9 am Wednesday. India’s Covid-19 tally is now 1,56,16,130, with a death toll of 1,82,553. There are 21,57,538 active cases in the country.

On Wednesday, Serum Institute of India said it would sell Covishield at Rs 400/dose to state governments and Rs 600/dose to private hospitals. It is currently selling its vaccine at Rs 150/dose to the central government. The Pune-headquartered company also said it would allocate 50 per cent of its capacities to the Centre’s vaccination programme, while the remaining 50 per cent would be for states and private hospitals. The statement came days after the Centre decided to allow anyone above the age of 18 to get vaccinated from May 1.","Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan Wednesday reiterated that the state would provide Covid-19 vaccines to all people free of cost.

Vijayan told reporters that people, across age groups, would get vaccine shots free of cost. “I have already stated in the past vaccination would be free in the state. I am not in the habit of changing my opinion occasionally,” he said.

Referring to the Union government’s new policy on vaccine distribution, Vijayan said the Centre has the responsibility of supplying vaccines to states. Federal governments have been asked to get vaccines from the manufacturers at a price, he said, adding that it would create financial burden on states.

About his letter to the PM on reconsidering the new policy on vaccine distribution and providing states the required quantity of vaccines free of cost, the chief minister said, “The Centre has not stated its view on it. We have put forward a demand which is the same as that of the entire country,” he said.

Till Wednesday noon, Kerala had administered 62,36,961 doses of vaccine, thus covering 14. 88 per cent of its population. Of the administered shots, 54,40,907 were first doses.","Serum Institute of India’s Covishield will be available to state governments at Rs 400 a dose and private hospitals at Rs 600 a dose, the Pune headquartered company said Wednesday.

The announcement comes two days after the central government decided to open up vaccinations against Covid-19 to those above the age of 18 years.

As per the government’s latest decision, around 50 percent of the doses produced by vaccine makers will be provided “in the open market” at a pre-declared price. State governments, private hospitals and private industry members can purchase these doses for vaccinations of those between the ages of 18 and 45 years.

It is not clear at this stage how much over this cost private hospitals will be able to charge those in this age group when they arrive at their facilities for vaccinations. Those above the age of 45 are eligible for free vaccinations at government centres and at a reduced rate of Rs 250 per dose at private facilities under the government’s immunization programme.

States are allowed to decide how they would ration out the doses they procure from vaccine makers directly.

The remaining 50 percent will be provided to the central government, which will be supplied to states as per a formula that the government has been using to distribute these resources across the country. This formula has not been disclosed by the government.

The other vaccine currently available in India’s immunisation programme is Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. The price of this vaccine has not been made public as yet.","Three employees of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) were allegedly abducted in the early hours of Wednesday from a rig site in Lakuwa field of Assam’s Sivasagar district, the company said. Authorities suspect that the banned United Liberation Front of Asom (Independent) (ULFA-I) is behind the abduction.

The three employees have been identified as Mohini Mohan Gogoi from Sivasagar district, and Alakesh Saikia and Retul Saikia from Jorhat district. While Mohini (32) and Alakesh (28) are both junior technicians, Retul, 38, is a junior engineering assistant. All three work in the production department and stay at the ONGC Colony in Sivasagar.

In a series of tweets, ONGC said that the employees were taken by “unknown armed miscreants” in a vehicle belonging to ONGC, which was later found abandoned near the Nimonagarh jungles, close to the Assam-Nagaland border.

3 ONGC employees, 2 Junior Engineer Assistants (Production) & a Junior Technician (Production) have been abducted by unknown armed miscreants in the early hours of 21 April 2021. The abduction took place on a rig site of ONGC in Lakwa field of Sivasagar District. — ONGC (@ONGC_) April 21, 2021

An ONGC spokesperson said that the incident took place at around 1 am, Wednesday. He said, “About 4-5 armed abductors used one of our ambulances — which was stationed at the site – to kidnap them.” He added that it happened at the Romonia rig located adjacent to Lakuwa tea estate, under Simalguri police station.

According to Sivasagar SP Amitava Sinha, the manner in which the abduction was done makes it seem like it was the “handiwork of the ULFA-I.” “It has to be some militant group. We are suspecting ULFA because that is the only militant group active in this area,” said SP Sinha.

“We found out about it this morning on TV news,” said Anurag Saikia, Alakesh’s brother, “My mother is very worried and our only request as a family is that three of them are released as soon as possible. My brother is very young. He just joined ONGC in August last year…what will they achieve from kidnapping him? We are only simple people.”

Meenu Gogoi, Mohini’s mother said that she last spoke to her on Tuesday afternoon. “There was a wedding today and he was supposed to come home,” she said, “But in the morning my daughter-in-law called me to say he had been kidnapped. What can I say? How will a mother feel when her only son is taken away? I haven’t eaten all day. I request them to release him at the earliest.”

SP Sinha said that they have asked for the security agencies in Nagaland to be on alert. “Nagaland is very close to the actual location of the incident — the vehicle was found abandoned near the Nagaland border. So, police in Nagaland’s Mon district has also been activated,” he added.

In December last year, ULFA(I) and Myanmar-faction of NSCN (K) had abducted two employees of the Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited from Kumchaikha hydrocarbon drilling site near Innao in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. They were released earlier this month.

ONGC is India’s biggest oil and gas exploration and production company. The company has been exploring and producing oil and gas in Upper Assam since the early 1960s.","Covid-19 testing on full swing in New Delhi on Wednesday. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)

The Health Ministry on Wednesday released a slew of comparative data, showing that the severity, virulence and demography of the victims in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 are about the same as the first wave.

Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 146 districts reported Covid-19 positivity rate of more than 15 per cent, while 274 districts reported case positivity between 5 and 15 per cent.

The release of the statistics follows growing panic in the country over concerns that the second wave is somehow more powerful and could cause greater havoc.

According to the figures shared by Bhushan, 4.03 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave in those below 10 years, while 2.97 per cent cases were registered in the second wave.

“In the age group 10-20 years, 8.07 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 8.50 per cent cases were registered in the second wave. In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41 per cent cases were reported in the first wave, while 19.35 per cent cases were registered in the second wave,” he said.

Bhushan further shared data which showed that in those aged 30 and above, 67.5 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 69.18 per cent cases registered in second wave.","The BSF personnel handed over the bird to the police with a demand in writing for taking legal action. (Representative image)

The BSF has sought the registration of an FIR against an intruder from Pakistan that happens to be a pigeon. The Punjab Police are seeking legal opinion on this.

The pigeon perched itself on the shoulder of a Border Security Force jawan at the Rorawala post here last Saturday, apparently after flying across the border, an official said.

A small piece of paper with a “contact number” was wrapped around its leg, the official said.

The BSF personnel handed over the bird to the police with a demand in writing for taking legal action.

Senior Superintendent of Police Dhruv Dahiya said the BSF demanded registration of an FIR against the pigeon.

“As the pigeon is a bird, I don’t think an FIR can be registered against it. But we have referred the matter to our legal experts for their opinion,” he said on Wednesday.

The number tagged on the pigeon’s leg is being analysed, he said.

Pigeons have been “captured” earlier as well in border areas with security forces suspecting espionage attempts. Homing pigeons can be used to courier information and the tags can carry coded messages.

Or the birds can be innocent, tagged with identification numbers by their keepers.

For now, the pigeon is being kept at the Khangarh police station.","The accused who was nabbed, police said, was identified as Deepak, who hails from Mathura and, along with the other two accused, identified as Ashok and Jaiprakash, works at a private company in Noida.

Two people have been arrested in Faridabad for throwing stones at police personnel when they were questioned upon being found on the streets during night curfew hours. A third accused is absconding in the case.

According to the police, the incident occurred around midnight on Monday on Air Force Road when a police patrolling vehicle spotted three men roaming in the area “needlessly”.

“Upon seeing them on the road during night curfew, the police personnel questioned the men about why they were outside. All three of them were intoxicated and started misbehaving with the personnel. They eventually became violent and started pelting stones at the police team,” said Sube Singh, PRO of Faridabad Police.

“One of the stones hit a woman police officer on her face, because of which she sustained injuries. Other personnel also sustained minor injuries. Although the team was able to nab one of the accused from the spot, the other two managed to flee,” he said.

The accused who was nabbed, police said, was identified as Deepak, who hails from Mathura and, along with the other two accused, identified as Ashok and Jaiprakash, works at a private company in Noida. An FIR was registered against the three men at the Saran police station, under Sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of duty), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 341 (wrongful restraint), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

“During questioning, Deepak had told police that Ashok resides in Noida and Jaiprakash is a resident of Faridabad’s Palla area. The three men had gone to meet some of Ashok’s relatives, who reside in Rajiv Colony,” said PRO Singh.

“Ashok has been arrested on the basis of information provided by Deepak, and investigations are underway to nab the third accused as well,” he said.

The injured police officer, meanwhile, was admitted in hospital after the incident and required 8 stitches for the injury.

In a similar incident in Delhi on Sunday, a couple was arrested for misbehaving with police personnel when they were asked to wear masks while travelling in their car.","Migrant labourers at Anand Vihar bus terminal in New Delhi on Tuesday. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna)

With India reporting a record-breaking surge in coronavirus cases, the country is witnessing yet another nationwide migrant exodus, as states begin imposing curfews and lockdowns to contain the spread of the deadly infection. In scenes reminiscent of the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India, thousands of workers are leaving for their hometowns and villages, fearing that they will lose their housing and livelihood if they remain in big cities.

During a nationwide address on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged state governments to convince labourers not to leave for their hometowns, while assuring them that they will not be stripped of their livelihood. “If we all follow COVID-19 protocols, there’ll be no need to impose lockdowns,” PM Modi said.

But despite the Prime Minister’s efforts to allay fears of an imminent lockdown, migrant workers continue to flee cities and towns across the country.

Delhi

Amidst a debilitating surge in coronavirus cases in the National Capital, thousands of migrants are rushing to bus depots and railway stations in search of a way out of the city. Many are pointing fingers at the government, accusing Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of not doing enough to protect their livelihood.

“How will we survive here if there’s a longer lockdown,” said Pinki, who works as a labourer at a printing press in Delhi. “Every time I see an election poster, I feel cheated. Nobody has helped us.”

Taking cues from the previous mass migrant movement during the last lockdown, the Special Branch of the Delhi Police has asked all 15 district police officials to counsel migrant workers and send them back to their homes or shelters if they are found roaming around without “authorisation”.

Predicting an increase in traffic at major inter-state bus terminals and railway stations owing to rumours about a lockdown, The Special Branch has also directed district police to intensify patrolling at night.

Meanwhile, an overcrowded bus ferrying labourers from Delhi to Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh overturned at Jhorasi ghati in Gwalior district, killing three people in the process.

Anil Singh Bhadoria, Station House Officer from Bhilow police station, said the accident took place at a steep turn, which then has a downward gradient, making it difficult for drivers to control their vehicles.

Andhra Pradesh

Free lunches, accommodation, face masks and sanitisers — these are some of the measures rice mill owners in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are promising to dissuade their workers from leaving this time amid fears of another lockdown due to the mounting Covid cases.

The Telangana government has imposed a 9 pm to 5 am night curfew from April 20 to May 1. This has added to the growing anxiety among the migrant workers, who believe this could be a prelude to a total lockdown across the state

In neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, which has around 3,000 rice mills, owners are providing free rice and vegetables to their workers in an attempt to lure them away from leaving.

Gujarat

Soon after the traders association announced a 10-day voluntary lockdown in the Valsad district, a huge rush of migrant workers was seen at Vapi railway station throughout Tuesday.

As the news of the voluntary lockdown spread through social media, migrant workers employed in the factories of Vapi Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) and Sarigam GIDC started leaving the city fearing larger restrictions were imminent. Many said they feared the lockdown might spell a loss of livelihood for migrant labourers like last year despite the industrial units in the GIDC estates remaining operational.

Justice Navin Chawla had on April 13 reserved judgement on the two separate petitions by Facebook and WhatsApp.

While reserving its decision, the court had observed that the order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) does not reflect an investigation into abuse of dominant position and rather appears to be concerned with privacy issues of consumers.

The observation came in response to CCI’s stand that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals’ privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.

CCI had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position.

“There is no question of jurisdictional error,” it had contended and added that WhatsApp and Facebook’s pleas challenging its decision were “incompetent and misconceived”.

WhatsApp and Facebook have challenged the CCI’s March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.

CCI had also told the court that only after the investigation can it be determined whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position.

CCI had also contended that the data collected, which would include an individual’s location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to “stalking”.

The two social media platforms, on the other hand, had contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then CCI ought not to have “jumped the gun” and intervened in the issue.

They had also said that CCI’s decision was an abuse of the commission’s suo motu jurisdiction.

They claimed that the CCI in the instant case has “drifted far away” from the competition aspect and was looking into the privacy issue which was already being looked into by the apex court and the Delhi High Court.

The two social media platforms had also told the court that private conversations continued to be protected by end to end encryption and WhatsApp cannot read what people message each other.

They had also contended that the most of the data generated belonged to WhatsApp as the only data provided by customers was their phone number which is required to register on the messaging platform.

In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same.","Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday held the BJP responsible for the “medical catastrophe” in the country and urged the people of West Bengal to speak for the entire nation while voting in the ongoing assembly polls.

“Voters in the 6th round of polling in West Bengal tomorrow (22 April) have a great opportunity to speak for the entire country,” he said.

The Congress leader condemned the current situation due to COVID-19 in the country. “What has changed since April 2020? If anything, things have become much worse,” he said.

Chidambaram also said the plight of migrant workers, as shown on TV, in long queues outside railway and bus stations was “heart rending”.

“There is no shortage of vaccines, says Health Minister. Believe the minister. There is only a shortage of patients. Central government will issue an advertisement calling for applications from patients who want vaccines,” he said in another tweet.

“There is no crowding at railway stations, says Railway minister. Believe the minister. The long queues shown on TV channels are there only to assist the Railway Police to guard the stations,” he added.

NEW DELHI: India's coronavirus situation is worsening by the day with the country reporting a record surge of nearly 3 lakh new infections and over 2,000 deaths on Wednesday morning.The massive spike in infections comes as the country battles a severe second wave of the pandemic, which has crippled the healthcare system and prompted the Centre to expedite the nationwide vaccination programme.""This second corona wave came like a storm,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged in his address to the nation on Tuesday.A total of 2,95,041 fresh infections were registered in a span of 24 hours, pushing India's total tally of Covid-19 cases to 1,56,16,130 while the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark, the data updated at 8 am showed.It was the second highest daily case count ever recorded by any country since the outbreak of the pandemic.Positivity rates on Tuesday also remained very high at 19% nationally, indicating that the daily tally may cross 3 lakh soon.This has also been the fastest addition of one million cases by India since the beginning of the pandemic.It took India only four days to take its total tally of Covid-19 cases from 14 to 15 million.The previous addition of one million cases took 6 days. This shows how rapidly the infections are spreading across the country.India, with over 15.6 crore total cases, is currently the second worst Covid-hit country in the world after the US.With over 30.2 crore total infections, the US is well ahead of India while Brazil has just over 14 crore cases.However, India is currently reporting way more cases than both the US and Brazil combined. On Wednesday, India's case count was over twice the figures of both US and Brazil put together.Ten states constituted 76% of the new cases reported on Wednesday with Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka and Kerala recording the highest new cases in the last 24 hours.The new infections, which were largely restricted to Maharashtra over a month ago, are now spreading rapidly to other parts of the country as well.UP, the most populous state in the country, is now reporting the second highest figures every day. Delhi is not too far behind with over 28,000 cases in the last 24 hours.Delhi's positivity rate was over 32%, higher than 25% in states such as West Bengal, and over 20% in Maharashtra and Jharkhand.Meanwhile, India's death toll increased to 1,82,553 on Wednesday with a record of 2,023 daily fatalities reported in the last 24 hours.Out of 2,023 new deaths reported, Maharashtra saw the highest number of fatalities at 519 followed by Delhi (277) Chhattisgarh (191).With an unprecedented rise in cases, India's active caseload has now shot past the 2.1-million mark.The active cases have now increased to 21,57,538, comprising 13.82 per cent of the total infections.Moreover, the national Covid-19 recovery rate dropped to 85.01 per cent.

(With inputs from IANS)

NEW DELHI: Even as India continues to witness an unprecedented surge in Covid cases, a new triple mutant strain has emerged as a fresh threat in the battle against the pandemic, reported IANS.Late last year, scientists had detected a new variant, called B.1.617, with two mutations - the E484Q and L452R. This double mutant strain was first detected in Maharashtra.Experts believed that India's ongoing second surge is fueled in part by double mutant strain of the virus, which is said to be more infectious.The third mutation is said to have been evolved from the double mutation where three different Covid strains have combined to form a new variant.Two of these triple mutant strains have been found in samples collected from Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.Viruses mutate all the time, as part of evolutionary biology. Some mutations weaken the virus while others may make it stronger, enabling it to proliferate faster or cause more infections.So far, India's health ministry has only acknowledged the presence of the âdouble mutantâ.

Dr Guleria

More than 85% of people will recover from Covid without any specific treatment in the form of remdesivir , etc.

, etc. Only small percentage of patients require Remdesivir. Don't consider this as a magic bullet.

As a country, if we work together, use oxygen and remdesivir judiciously, then, there will be no shortage anywhere. In terms of the number of people who need oxygen and oxygen supply, we are well balanced.

Vaccines prevent you from getting the disease in the form of severe illness. It may not prevent you from getting the infection altogether.

Even after inoculation, we may see a positive case. Thus, it is important to wear a mask even after you get vaccinated.

Dr Naresh Trehan

Less percentage of people require hospitalisation. The hospital beds should be utilised judiciously and with responsibility.

We've now made a protocol that remdesivir shouldn't be administered to everyone who tests positive.

It's use should be based on test results, symptoms, comorbidities of a patient, etc.

Remdesivir isn't a 'Ramban', it only decreases viral load in people who need it.

We need to use Remdesivir judiciously.

If you don't need oxygen then don't use it as a security blanket. Waste of oxygen will only lead to depriving someone who needs it more.

Dr Devi Shetty

Get yourself tested for Covid-19 if you have any symptom like bodyache, cold, cough, indigestion, vomiting.

In case one is positive, see a doctor and get his opinion. It is a problem that can be solved provided you get the medical help at an early stage and follow doctor's instructions.

There is a possibility that you may be asymptomatic. In that case, stay at home, isolate yourself, wear a mask and check your oxygen saturation every 6 hours.

If the oxygen saturation is above 94% then there is no problem.

If the oxygen level falls after exercise, call a doctor.

Zimbabwe looked threatening at 77 for two in the 10th over but Qadir (3/29) and pacer Mohammad Hasnain (2/27) kept it to 138 for seven in the allotted 20 overs.

Zimbabwe needed 20 off the last over but fast bowler Haris Rauf bowled a tight length to concede just eight and pull off a hard earned win, helping Pakistan to 1-0 lead in the three-match series.

The scores: Pakistan 149/7 in 20 overs (Mohammad Rizwan 82 n.o., ) bt Zimbabwe 138/7 in 20 overs (Craig Ervine 34, Luke Jongwe 30 n.o., Usman Qadir 3/29).

Fast bowler Khaleel Ahmed led an impressive bowling effort before Jonny Bairstow smashed an unbeaten fifty as Sunrisers Hyderabad snapped their three-match losing streak with a convincing nine-wicket win over Punjab Kings in an IPL game here on Wednesday.

Asked to bowl first, Sunrisers Hyderabad's pace-spin duo of Khaleel (3/21) and Abhishek Sharma (2/24) did bulk of the damage to bundle out Punjab Kings for a below-par 120 in 19.4 overs.

Senior pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/16), star Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan (1/17) and Siddarth Kaul (1/27) also picked up a wicket each as Punjab never gained momentum.

Chasing the total, SRH openers Jonny Bairstow (63) and David Warner (37) pummelled Punjab into submission, adding 73 runs off 60 balls to set the foundation.

Bairstow and Kane Williamson (16) then knocked off the remaining runs as SRH romped home with 8 balls to spare.

Bairstow and Warner smashed five boundaries and two sixes during their 50-run stand in the powerplay, while Punjab had managed nine fours and two maximums in their entire innings.

Warner picked up the first boundary when he sent Mohammed Shami across point in the third ball of the innings. Bairstow then welcomed Fabian Allen with a four and a six in the next over.

A low full toss by Shami was then sent across the mid-wicket by Bairstow before Warner hit the Indian through backward point.

Bairstow also pulled Moises Henriques over long leg, while Warner swatted Arshdeep Singh over the backward square leg.

Warner sent Deepak Hooda sailing over extra cover for a six but in the next over he holed out to Mayank off Allen, who bowled a wicket maiden, as SRH were 73 for 1.

Bairstow found an able ally in Williamson, who was playing his first match of the season, as they added an unbeaten 48 runs to help SRH log their first win of the season.

Earlier, Shahrukh Khan (22) and Mayank Agarawal (22) were the top scorers for Punjab Kings, who came into the match after two losses.

In an innings when clearing the boundary seemed to be a tall task, Khan managed two sixes, while Agarwal, who was dropped on 0 in the very first over by Rashid, hit two fours.

Opting to bat in their first game at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Punjab lost their in-form skipper KL Rahul (4) early on.

Agarwal and Chris Galye (15) stitched 24-run partnership. However, at the end of the seventh over, Khaleel got rid of the Indian with Rashid making no mistakes this time at midwicket.

West Indian Nicholas Pooran (0) was out for a diamond duck as Sunrisers skipper David Warner effected his run out in the eighth over. Gayle followed his compatriot in the next over as he was adjudged leg before.

Punjab was reeling at 53 for 4 at the halfway mark as wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals.

Deepak Hooda (13) and Australian all-rounder Moises Henriques (14) got starts but were unable to capitalised on them. Spin all-rounder Fabian Allen (6) also struggled on his debut.

Local star Khan tried to inject some hope into the Punjab camp but a slower ball by Khaleel ended his cameo.

Murugan Ashwin (9) hit a boundary but Kaul accounted for the spinner in the last over which was followed by the dismissal of Shami (3), who was run out.","The Royals bowling unit has been underwhelming to say the least.

Off to the best possible start with three wins on the trot, a confident Royal Challengers Bangalore will hope to keep the juggernaut rolling when they take on Rajasthan Royals in an IPL match here on Thursday.

Both sides have endured contrasting campaigns so far.

RCB head in to the game after three morale-boosting victories. The Virat Kohli-led side edged past defending champions Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener before getting the better of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders to jump to the top of the points table.

On the other hand, the Royals have managed to win only one of their three fixtures. They lost to Chennai Super Kings in their previous match to slip down to the sixth spot. Sanju Samson and his men will be eyeing a second win.

The Royals have struggled to perform as a cohesive batting unit. While Samson led the team to within touching distance of victory with his sensational century against Punjab Kings, it was the South African duo of David Miller and Chris Morris that pulled off a win against the Delhi Capitals.

Against CSK, opener Jos Buttler looked dangerous but the other batsmen failed to provide any valuable contributions. For the former champions to do well, the side must click as a batting unit with Samson and the Englishman playing key roles.

The Royals bowling unit has been underwhelming to say the least, apart from the game against Delhi Capitals, the bowlers have leaked runs. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat shone against the Rishabh Pant led-side, registering the impressive figures of 3/15, while young Chetan Sakariya has shown promise.

In the absence of Jofra Archer, more will be expected out of the likes of Chris Morris and Bangladesh speedster Mustafizur Rahman.

For RCB, Ab de Villiers and new-recruit Glenn Maxwell have been the standout players with the willow. While the South African continues to deliver season after season, the Australian all-rounder is proving to be a valuable addition to the middle order.

Kohli has got decent starts in a couple of games but the talismanic skipper will be itching to play a big innings. Young Devdutt Padikkal, who impressed everyone last season, has also looked rusty and is yet to perform to his full potential. After two failures Rajat Patidar will, too, look to make amends.

The RCB bowling department has been impressive with pacers Harshal Patel and Mohammed Siraj boasting economy rate of of 5.75 and 5.81 respectively. The former pulled the rabbit out of the hat with a five-wicket haul against MI while left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (3/7) changed the complexion of the match in just one over against the Sunrisers.

In an interesting move RCB played only three foreigners instead of four in the game against KKR. It will be interesting to see if they go for a similar playing XI or get in the likes of leg-spinner Adam Zampa, pacer Kane Richardson or experienced all-rounder Daniel Christian, who hasn’t impressed with the bat or ball, back into the team.

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (c), AB de Villiers, Devdutt Padikkal, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Siraj, Kane Richardson, Washington Sundar, Pavan Deshpande, Joshua Philippe, Shahbaz Ahamad, Navdeep Saini, Adam Zampa, Kyle Jamieson, Glenn Maxwell, Rajat Patidar, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Azharuddeen, Dan Christian, KS Bharat, Suyash Prabhudessai, Daniel Sams and Harshal Patel.

"China said on Wednesday that it was committed to maintain peace and stability along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as it urged India to put the boundary issue at an “appropriate position” and meet it “halfway” for the long term development of the bilateral ties.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said this at his media briefing as he parried questions on India’s assertion that consensus reached by the leaders on maintaining peace along the border cannot be swept under the carpet

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri in his recent address to the India-China dialogue forum said that the significance of the consensus reached between leaders of the two countries to maintain peace along the LAC cannot be “swept under the carpet” and called for the complete disengagement of troops in Eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the “serious incidents”.

In a candid address to the ICWA (Indian Council of World Affairs)-CPIFA (Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs) virtual dialogue on April 15, Misri also questioned the Chinese officials ignoring the “significant consensus” reached by the leaders of the two sides about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.

Asked for his reaction, Wang said that both sides held in-depth and candid talks on resolving the disengagement from the remaining areas of Eastern Ladakh after the withdrawal from Pangong Tso lake area.

Top Commanders of the two militaries held the 11th round of talks on April 9 to disengage the troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang areas in Eastern Ladakh.

“On the issue of China-India boundary situation, China’s position is consistent and clear. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and we are firmly determined to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and security,” Wang said.

“Recently, the two sides have maintained communications through diplomatic and military channels. On the basis of disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso regions, the two sides exchanged in depth and in a candid manner, opinions on resolving the remaining issue in the Western section of the boundary,” he said.

“We hope India will meet China halfway and will focus on the bigger picture of long term development of bilateral relations, put the boundary at an appropriate position and work to bring relations back to the track of steady and sound development,” he said.

To a follow-up question on Misri’s remarks, Wang reiterated that “we hope that India will meet China halfway and focus on the long-term development of bilateral relations, cherish the existing hard-won momentum for the de-escalation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border and work to bring bilateral relations back to the track of sound and steady development”.

Asked why China is not disengaging its troops from the remaining areas after the withdrawal from Pangong Tso, Wang said, “I would like to stress that recently, China and India through diplomatic and military channels maintained close communications”.

“On the basis of realising disengagement in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso, the two sides held candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolving remaining issues in the Western section of the boundary,” he said.

“We hope that the Indian side will abide by the agreements between the two militaries and consensus of the two sides and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,” he said.

In his address, Misri said the “sustainable solution” to the “present difficulties” in the Sino-India relations is “it must be one, as External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar has suggested, that is based on mutual sensitivity and respect and paves the way for maximizing our mutual interests”.

“The first is to note the importance of the two sides having maintained a sustained diplomatic and military dialogue in attempting to resolve issues. These discussions thus far have helped in achieving substantial disengagement of our forces,” he said.

“The second is to point out that senior leaders on both sides have committed and agreed that we must achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas. That would be an important first step towards considering de-escalation; it would also help in restoring peace and tranquility and, together, these would provide conditions for gradual and step-by-step progress in the bilateral relationship,” he said.

“This is also what would begin to restore trust and confidence in the relationship and help us rebuild the foundation of the relationship that was damaged through last year’s actions in Eastern Ladakh,” Misri had said.","Sri Lanka has asked a Chinese ship to leave the southern port of Hambantota after it was found to be carrying radioactive material, officials said on Wednesday.

(Reuters)

A US Jury has found former police officer Derek Chauvin guilty for the murder of George Floyd, an African-American man who was handcuffed and pinned to the ground under the knee of Chauvin for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.

He has been found guilty on three charges: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin can be sentenced for up to 40 years in prison.

Also Read | Derek Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter in George Floyd case

In May 2020, the incident happened when Floyd was arrested by four police officers for trying to pay with a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store in Minneapolis.

Floyd’s death led to widespread violent protests in Minneapolis and around the United against racism and targeted police brutality.

Chauvin’s bail was revoked and he will remain in police custody till his sentencing, which is eight weeks from now.

The verdict is historic for the US as the American justice and police system had long given leeway and protections to police officers after they have used excessive violence towards civilians, particularly Black people.

In March, the State of Minnesota approved a $27 million settlement with Floyd’s family in a wrongful death suit in police custody.

What are the three charges?

The second-degree unintentional murder charge alleged that Chavin didn’t intend to kill Floyd while committing or attempting to commit third degree assault. And the third-degree murder charge alleged that Floyd’s death was caused by Chauvin by “perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.”

The second-degree manslaughter charge alleged that Chauvin’s culpable negligence created an unreasonable risk causing Floyd’s death.

The common element between all three charges was that Chauvin’s negligence in using force caused Floyd’s death.

The Trial

The trial, which began on March 29, was a highly emotional affair considering the rising tensions surrounding the death of Floyd.

The almost 10-minute-long video of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck while he pleaded “I can’t breathe”, was shot by a teenage girl who appeared on the witness stand. There were also 45 other witnesses, including medical experts and former police officers.

Floyd’s girlfriend, Courteney Ross also took to the stand and described her and Floyd’s struggle with addiction and painkillers.

The state attorneys argued that Floyd’s death was caused by excessive force used by Chauvin. They also brought in former police personnel who argued that Chauvin overstepped the line and was required to withdraw when Floyd was no longer resisting. Chauvin also did not adhere to his training to offer medical assistance to Floyd.

Medical expert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Floyd died due to lack of oxygen due to the excessive restraint applied by Chauvin.

The defense justified Chauvin’s actions saying the officers were overwhelmed by the number of bystanders and Floyd’s size. They argued that Floyd’s heart condition and the presence of drugs in his body led to his death.

Medical experts stated that even a healthy person would have died from Chauvin kneeling on their neck for 10 minutes.

Chauvin himself did not testify and remained on bail throughout the trial.

Who was the jury?

Due to the sensitivity of the case, the fourteen jurors remained anonymous and unseen throughout the trial.

The jurors had been selected over a period of time and were questioned by both state and defense attorneys before being on the panel. On the final day of the trial, two jurors were told they were alternatives.

The final verdict was announced by twelve jurors who took less than a day to make their final decision.

NPR reported that the final jury was multiracial with six white individuals, four black and two identifying as multiracial. Out of these were five men and seven women.

Considering the high public coverage of the trial, the defense requested that the jury be sequestered to prevent their decision from being influenced by any third parties. The request, however, was denied and the jury was sequestered after the final day of the trail and before announcing their verdict.

What was the reaction?

During the trial, police and national guard troops had been stationed outside the court. Before the verdict, shop owners boarded up their windows in Minnesota fearing violence.

There were large crowds and media waiting outside the court to hear the verdict, after the verdict was announced, the crowd erupted in joy.

Reuters quoted Floyd’s brother Philonise saying, “We are able to breathe again.” He added their fight for justice is not yet over.

In his address to the nation, President Joe Biden said that the verdict was a big step in ensuring accountability and ensuring racial justice in America. Vice President Kamala Harris recognised the systemic racism in the United State and said that lives of Black Americans must be valued in the country’s criminal justice system.

Politicians and celebrities across the United States welcomed the verdict and said, “Justice has been served.” Public figures across the world have also commended the verdict.","The announcement follows two earlier agreements between Israel and Moderna to supply a total of 10 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.(Reuters/File)

But while her identity may be known, her location and data are protected by layers of security protocols.

Even before the coup on February 1, she and many activists have had to adapt in order to protect themselves and the information they are trying to get out of Myanmar from military censors.

Thinzar Shunlei Yi said she has been targeted by online attacks in the past, and that maintaining digital security has always been important.

Young activists in Myanmar came of age during almost ten years of semi-democratic rule when they had full access to the internet.

However, the constant threat of military surveillance of internet data and social media content has led many people to use tools like Virtual Private Network (VPN) apps, encrypted messaging services and anonymous browsers in order to communicate and post content without fear of detection or arrest.

According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB), a Thailand-based human rights organization, more than 3,600 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced since Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, took power in February.

Many face up to 20 years in prison for inciting hatred towards the military and three to seven years for stirring up fear or unrest in public. Hundreds more have been killed.

“People are paying the price almost every day on the street,” said Thinzar Shunlei Yi. “Myanmar people feel that we have nothing more to lose.”

Myanmar’s growing online activist army

In the days following the coup, scores of people in Myanmar took to social media to share their shock and anger.

In the days that followed, activists, citizen journalists and concerned citizens stepped away from Facebook to platforms like Twitter and TikTok. Many people were wary of the military monitoring and spreading false information on Facebook.

Phone calls and text messages moved to encrypted messaging services like Signal or Telegram. When the internet was completely blocked, people used the telephone.

A broader civil disobedience movement soon went online, with platforms used to organize boycotts and strikes. Activists say they will continue protests against military rule, and will use social media to broadcast their message to an international audience.

“The thing is that with citizen journalists, we are everywhere. We all have our digital devices and we can all still find an internet connection,” said Thinzar Shunlei Yi.

The number of Twitter users in Myanmar grew from an estimated 190,000 in December 2020 to 1.2 million in March 2021, according to numbers on StatCounter and DataReportal.

As the protests grew in intensity, Twitter was now being filled with images and videos using the hashtag #WhatsHappeningInMyanmar.

Others moved to TikTok and started posting live and recorded videos of clashes between protesters and police, and tributes to those killed. The hashtag #savemyanmar has been used 1.4 billion times on the platform.

Playing cat and mouse with censors

The military has reacted to the rise in pro-democracy content by continuing to disseminate fake news on Facebook, while arresting prominent social media influencers who dare to speak out.

The military regime has also progressively shut down internet access across Myanmar while trying to block access to social media sites.

Only broadband-based internet connections at homes and offices remain online as the military tries to keep the economy going.

Without mobile internet, users take risks to find open Wifi hot spots. And almost all internet access remains blocked at night.

Michael Hull, the president of the Psiphon Inc, the company that makes the censorship circumvention app Psiphon, has been monitoring the situation in Myanmar.

According to company data shared with DW, the use of the Psiphon app increased from around 6,000 daily users just before the coup to almost 2 million users within 48 hours after the coup.

During the next few weeks, Psiphon was the number one downloaded app in Myanmar as more and more people needed the technology to access blocked sites.

“This has been a universal response to shutdowns regardless of where people are around the world,” Hull told DW.

“Populations are capable of not only reacting but communicating to each other the information needed to get people back online,” he added.

Psiphon, which is available in Burmese, works by encrypting the data coming from the device and allows users to access blocked content – like social media sites – through a variety of technologies and by routing the data through a network of servers around the world.

Even with all the barriers that currently limit how internet can be accessed in Myanmar, Hull said that 600,000 people a day are still using Psiphon to access blocked sites while connected to a wired broadband connection.

“During initial phases, internet service providers that are implementing these shutdowns are not very sophisticated and Psiphon is easily able to circumnavigate any kind of large-scale blocking,” said Hull, adding that the company monitors and adjusts its technology as censors get more sophisticated.

Facing violence for free speech

In Myanmar, even having Psiphon or other circumvention apps installed on a smartphone can be a reason for arrest. There have been reports of police stopping people to check devices.

Protesters are now encouraging each other to leave their phones at home or to delete incriminating photos or apps.

Justice for Myanmar (JFM), a group that monitors abuses by the military, accused the Tatmadaw of mass violations of human rights and using the internet shutdowns to censor and surveil citizens and activists. The group’s own website was blocked by the military in 2020.

“The internet shutdown is causing serious harm to the people of Myanmar, and restricting civil society and independent media,” JFM spokesperson Yadanar Maung told DW.

Activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi said protesters are finding creative means of getting their content online, and that grassroots movements for change are also a cry for help to the international community.

“If we don’t act right now, [the Tatmadaw] will inspire many more brutal dictators around the world,” she said. “It is our duty to defend democracy.”","Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie was arrested by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.... Read More

FORT LAUDERDALE: The superintendent of the Florida school district where 17 students and staff died in a 2018 high school massacre was arrested Wednesday on a perjury charge .

Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie was arrested by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and charged with perjury in an official proceeding, which is a felony, county jail records show.

FDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger said no further information was immediately available and it was not known if the arrest is connected to the investigation that followed the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School .

Jail records do not show if Runcie, 59, has an attorney. The school district did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. He was released on his own recognizance. Broward County is the nation's sixth-largest school district with more than 270,000 students.

Runcie came into the national spotlight after the shooting when some parents criticized him for programs they felt had been lenient toward the shooter.

Runcie, by a 6-3 vote, survived a 2019 motion by the school board that sought to have him removed. The attempt was led by Lori Alhadef, who was elected to the board after her 14-year-old daughter, Alyssa, was killed in the shooting.

The superintendent's critics said bullying and other school problems were routinely underreported by Stoneman Douglas and other district schools and few did voluntary security assessments. Stoneman Douglas reported zero incidents of bullying among its 3,200 students between 2014 and 2017 and three incidents of vandalism, for example.

Another target of criticism has been the district's Promise Program, a student disciplinary system Runcie instituted shortly after he began as superintendent in 2011. Under Promise, students who fight or commit petty vandalism, theft, harassment or other minor crimes, are referred to an off-campus site for up to 10 days instead of the courts.

Critics say Promise created a lenient atmosphere that allowed shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz to briefly attend Stoneman Douglas a year before the massacre despite a history of fights, threats and behavioral problems. The district says while the program needed changes, it was a success overall.

Alhadef did not immediately return a call Wednesday seeking comment.

His supporters have praised him for increasing the district's graduation rate, improving schools districtwide and reaching out to minority communities.

","US Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a sweeping investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis. ... Read More

WASHINGTON: US Attorney General Merrick Garland on Wednesday launched a sweeping investigation into policing practices in Minneapolis following a jury's verdict that former city police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd .

The probe ""will assess whether the Minneapolis Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force, including during protests,"" Garland told a news conference.

Chauvin's conviction was a milestone in the fraught racial history of the United States and a rebuke of law enforcement's treatment of Black Americans.

Garland has previously said he will make cracking down on police misconduct a priority.

President Joe Biden called the conviction of Chauvin a ""giant step"" toward justice in the United States.

The Justice Department previously announced an investigation into whether the officers involved in Floyd's death violated his civil rights.

The Justice Department on Friday withdrew a policy put in place during former President Donald Trump 's administration that limited the tools the federal government could use to monitor and probe police misconduct.

Garland, in a memo to staff, said the department would return to its traditional practices of investigating state and local police departments, allowing unit heads to approve most settlements and consent decrees.

","The US is set to meet President Joe Biden's latest vaccine goal of administering 200 million Covid-19 shots in... Read More

WASHINGTON: The US is set to meet President Joe Biden 's latest vaccine goal of administering 200 million Covid-19 shots in his first 100 days in office, as the White House steps up its efforts to inoculate the rest of the public.

With more than 50% of adults at least partially vaccinated, Biden on Wednesday will reflect on his efforts to expand vaccine distribution and access in his first three months in the White House. But with all those 16 and older now eligible for shots, the president is expected to outline his administration's plans to drive up the vaccination rate even further.

With roughly 28 million vaccine doses being delivered each week, demand has eclipsed supply as the constraining factor to vaccinations in much of the country. While surveys have shown that vaccine hesitancy has declined since the rollout of the shots, administration officials believe they have to make getting vaccinated easier and more appealing.

Maximizing the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming months is critical for the White House, which is aiming to restore a semblance of normalcy around the July Fourth holiday and even more so by the beginning of the next school year.

Biden was not expected to set new public targets for vaccinations, and administration officials have been careful to avoid predicting when they project the country will have vaccinated enough people to reach herd immunity. The U.S. is on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult by the end of May and for every American by July, but administering them will be another matter.

In recent weeks the White House has launched a massive outreach campaign to Americans to get vaccinated, relying on funding from the $1.9 trillion virus relief package passed last month to launch ads and fund direct community engagement to under-vaccinated constituencies.

Biden set his 200 million shot goal last month after meeting his 100 million-in-100 days goal just over a month ago. At the time the US was well on pace to meet the higher target, and the pace of vaccinations has only accelerated, to about 3 million shots per day.

The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the US had even one authorized vaccine for Covid-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.

By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the US had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden 's goal was not ambitious enough. He quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.

It a deliberate effort by Biden to set clear - and achievable - metrics for success as part of a strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration's sometimes fanciful rhetoric on the virus.

ISLAMABAD: A banned Pakistani Islamist group called an end to violent nationwide anti-France protests on Tuesday after the government called a parliamentary vote on whether to expel the French ambassador and halted criminal cases against the group's members.

Pakistan outlawed the group Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) last week after its members blocked main highways, railways and access routes to major cities, assaulting police and burning public property.

The group has demanded that Pakistan expel the French ambassador in retaliation for the publication in France of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.

Four police officers were killed, 11 taken hostage and more than 800 wounded, many seriously, during the week-long clashes. The Islamists said three of their members were killed.

Prime Minister Imran Khan warned his nation on Monday that Pakistan risked paying a price if it expelled the French envoy, as half the country's exports are sold to the European Union .

Nevertheless, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad said on Tuesday that the government had agreed ""after long negotiations with the TLP"" to put a resolution before parliament on whether to expel the ambassador. Parliament was specially convened so that the motion could be tabled.

All criminal cases registered against the TLP would also be withdrawn as a result of the agreement with the group, which had agreed in return to end its protests, the minister said.

The TLP responded by releasing an audio statement of its spokesman Shafiq Amini saying: ""It is requested to end protests wherever they are happening across the country.""

However there was no immediate sign that crowds were dispersing at the biggest protest, in the city of Lahore, where thousands of followers were gathered outside the group's headquarters.

The TLP has also demanded the release of its leader and hundreds of arrested staff, the removal of the ban and the dismissal of the interior minister.

Relations between Paris and Islamabad became more strained after President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute late last year to a French teacher who was beheaded by a man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons depicting the Prophet in a lesson on free speech. Many Muslims consider such cartoons blasphemous. Macron maintains that free speech is a fundamental right in France.

At that time, protests broke out in Muslim world, including one led by the Islamists who shut the main highway to Islamabad until Khan's government agreed to endorse a boycott of French products and expel the envoy.

France has already advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan.

Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, a political analyst, told Reuters the government wanted the parliament to vote on the future of the French envoy, ""so they can say they have consulted with them and whatever step they take has a consensus behind it"".

Last week's violence erupted after the government detained TLP leader Saad Hussain Rizvi on April 12 ahead of the planned anti-France campaign. The government started the negotiations after the Islamists freed the 11 police hostages on Monday.

The government's apparent acceptance of the militants' demands would be seen as a victory for the Islamists, said author and analyst Khaled Ahmed.

""The government's retreat from its stance and agreement indicate that none of the institutions can stand against them,"" he said.

","Pakistan PM Imran Khan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's government will seek a vote in parliament on Tuesday on whether to expel the French ambassador after violent anti-France protests by Islamists demanding action over cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammad , the interior minister said.

Prime Minister Imran Khan warned his nation in a televised address late on Monday that Pakistan risked paying a price if it expelled the French envoy, as half the country's exports are sold to the European Union .

Relations between Paris and Islamabad became more strained after President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute late last year to a French teacher who was beheaded by a man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons depicting the Prophet in a class on freedom of speech.

Muslims consider such drawings of their Prophet to be blasphemous.

The expulsion of the ambassador is one of the main four demands of a radical Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan ( TLP ) group, which the government banned last week after its members blocked main highways, railways and access routes to major cities, assaulting police and burning public property.

Four police officers were killed, almost a dozen were taken hostage and more than 800 wounded, many of them seriously, during clashes with the Islamists.

The Islamists say that three TLP members were also killed.

The violence erupted after the government detained TLP leader Saad Hussain Rizvi ahead of a planned countrywide anti-France campaign aimed at pressuring Prime Minister Khan to take action.

On Monday, the government said it had entered negotiations with the TLP, and that the Islamist group had freed 11 police that had been snatched during a clash outside the TLP's headquarters in the eastern city of Lahore.

""After long negotiations between government of Pakistan and the TLP, this has been agreed that we will table a resolution in parliament today to expel French ambassador,"" Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad said in a video recorded statement.

Aside from wanting the ambassador expelled, the TLP is demanding the release of their leader and hundreds of arrested workers, the removal of ban on the group and the dismissal of the interior minister.

All cases registered against the TLP and its workers will be withdrawn, the interior minister said, adding that the group will end all the sit-in protests from across the country.

","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had hoped a fight over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed would result in an easy win -- placating the ultra-conservative quarters at home while being hailed as a defender of Islam abroad.

The gamble seems to have backfired spectacularly.

For the past week, riots have again engulfed Pakistan, with police officers killed and taken hostage, and the French embassy taking the ""urgent"" step of advising its citizens to leave the country.

Khan is now scrambling to keep order, months after launching a war of words with President Emmanuel Macron following the French leader's defence of the magazine Charlie Hebdo's right to republish images of Mohammed -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.

When Macron openly backed the magazine, Khan took up a crusade -- accusing the French leader of insulting Islam and using an address to the United Nations as an opportunity to lambast the West.

But rather than appease the religious right, Khan's grievance appears only to have encouraged the extremists, with the radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan ( TLP ) -- the Movement at the Service of the Prophet -- calling for the expulsion of the French ambassador.

""I think the prime minister has realised that appeasing the radical forces isn't an easy task because when you try to please them they demand more and more,"" security analyst Amir Rana told AFP.

""So far he has failed to maintain the balance.""

Few issues resonate in Islamic Pakistan quite like blasphemy, where the publication of the cartoons in Europe has long stoked outrage.

""No Pakistani politician or military dictator has or is going to challenge the idea that the honour and the sanctity of Islam and the prophet, and his person in particular, are not important to them,"" said political analyst Mosharraf Zaidi.

""Any time that the prime minister is representing that view, it's one that has salience in the Pakistani mainstream.""

Khan's rhetoric coincided with a wave of Francophobia that prompted a nationwide boycott of French goods, and upstart party TLP sent its supporters into the streets.

The outrage quickly boiled over into violence.

In September, a Pakistani national stabbed two people outside Charlie Hebdo's former office in Paris just days after Khan railed against Islamophobia at the UN general summit.

The assailant later admitted to being inspired by the likes of Khadim Rizvi, the late leader of the TLP.

The protests in Pakistan reached a violent climax in November when the group laid siege to the capital, Islamabad, sparking days of fighting.

The violence only ended after Khan's government allegedly agreed to a deal with the TLP that would see the French ambassador booted out after receiving parliamentary approval.

But last week, the TLP said the government had reneged on the agreement -- a deal officials have been vague about -- and its new leader Saad Rizvi called for a march on Islamabad, to take place on Tuesday.

When his arrest was met with nationwide rioting, Khan's government retaliated by officially banning the TLP -- effectively labelling them a terrorist outfit.

""No one can be above the law and the constitution,"" tweeted Khan over the weekend, where he also called for Western nations to outlaw blasphemous speech.

But even then he hedged his bets, suggesting he sympathised with their ideology, if not their methods.

Banning the TLP may have little impact, however, as other religious parties have now thrown their support behind the group.

""The Pakistani state has, over decades, actively fostered the ideology that led to the TLP and that leads many in the population to sympathise with the TLP,"" said Madiha Afzal, a Brookings Institution fellow.

""Khan attempted to try to thread this needle in his tweets about the group... but it is a tough line to walk: not disavowing the group's ideology and demands while taking action.""

Khan appears to have few easy options -- crack down even harder on a group claiming to defend Islam and risk sparking a wider confrontation in the deeply religious country.

Or, the government can accede to some of the TLP's demands and embolden religious fanatics to continue using violence in the future as a potent bargaining chip.

""There is no doubt there is a bind,"" said Zaidi.

""Pakistan has to certainly manage its relationship not just with France and other nations and the rest of the world but it must also be seen to be responsive to the sentiments of Pakistani Muslims.""

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday expelled an Antigua-registered ship that entered the island's territory without declaring a radioactive cargo bound for China.

The country's Atomic Energy Regulatory Council said the MV BBC Naples was asked to leave after it was found to be in the Chinese-run port of Hambantota on Tuesday night carrying uranium hexafluoride.

""The ship failed to declare its dangerous cargo - uranium hexafluoride - and we decided to order it to leave our waters immediately,"" council director general Anil Ranjith told AFP.

The ship had come from Rotterdam but authorities did not say where in China it was headed.

Ranjith said it was an offence to enter a port without declaring the material, which is used to enrich uranium, the fuel for nuclear power stations and weapons.

Sri Lanka's opposition leader Sajith Premadasa demanded an investigation into the incident, describing it as a serious safety threat.

""The navy has not been allowed to board the vessel to carry out an inspection,"" Premadasa said.

There was no immediate comment from the government.

Hambantota port was leased to China in 2017 for 99 years after the Colombo government was unable to repay $1.4 million it had borrowed from Beijing to build it.

Hambantota, about 260 kilometres (162 miles) south of Colombo, is near key Indian Ocean shipping lanes.

The entry of two Chinese submarines into Colombo in 2014 angered neighbouring India, the traditional regional power which is competing with Beijing for influence in the Indian Ocean.

Since then, Sri Lanka has not allowed Chinese submarine visits.

","WASHINGTON: Asserting that China and India are to be a factor in the regional prosperity, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has said it is ""a moment of choice"" for neighbouring Pakistan as all its calculations have been ""wrong"" so far.

Ghani, in an interview to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria which aired on Sunday, said that verbally, the leaders of Pakistan all fortunately acknowledge that they do not want the Taliban government in Afghanistan, that they would like to see a peaceful, stable, democratic government in the war-torn country.

âWe are key to their prosperity. The rate of growth in Afghanistan could enhance by two per cent in a stable and connected Afghanistan, we have to work together.

âSo, there are two optionsâ¦ Connect to Central Asia through us, share in the joint prosperity through the partnership for peace, gain international credibility and support that they're all in need of, or opt for chaos,â he said.

The country that would be most damaged by insecurity or a renewed civil war in Afghanistan is Pakistan, and in that case, it would be a lose proposition, Ghani said.

âIt's a moment of choice for Pakistan. All its calculations have been wrong,â the Afghanistan President said.

Afghanistan has in the past accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for terror groups that target its territory, especially the Afghan Taliban , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Haqqani group.

Responding to a question, Ghani said that China is not an interventionist power.

âIt does not want to get engaged with military or proxy wars, and Pakistan in terms of its foreign policy obviously is hedging between China and other countries, because it is still, its reliance on the rest of the region is quite significant. Pakistan can become an anchor of regional stability if it opts for peace in regional cooperation,â he said.

The discourse of Pakistan has changed, he said, adding that there was a security conference in Islamabad where the talk was really significantly about harmony and cooperation.

âTo expect that China, after the great COVID reset and the significant adverse impact will get involved in regional conflicts directly, I think is remote. Furthermore, we have a lot of positive relationships with China and the growth of China now is going to be the factor as growth of India for regional prosperity.

âAll of us are strong stakeholders not to get involved. And for Afghanistan, we do not want a replacement in terms of seeking to replace the United States and NATO with some form of patronage. We want to have a multi-aligned policy where we are friends with everybody and not part of their quarrels, and hence our agenda of permanent neutrality that will benefit everybody,â Ghani said.

Responding to a question on the withdrawal of US troops from his country by September 11, he said that this is a time of opportunity for Afghanistan.

âFor the Taliban and for Pakistan, it's a moment of choice. Will they opt to become a credible international stakeholder, with rules of game for a peaceful part of Asia and connectivity, or for opting for chaos?â he said.

âEqually for the Taliban, the major excuse that this is a war to get the international forces out of Afghanistan is over. There is no religious justification left for the war. Political settlement is a must. But the ball clearly is in the court of Taliban and their supporters,â Ghani added.

US President Joe Biden last week announced that the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan will start on May 1 and will be completed by September 11 this year, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York.

He said: ""It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.""

Biden has said that India, Pakistan, Russia, China, and Turkey have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan and these regional stakeholders should do more to bring peace in this war-torn country.

LONDON: Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday thanked well-wishers for their messages of support after the death of her husband, Prince Philip , as she turned 95 and spent her first birthday without him in more than seven decades.

""My family and I would like to thank you all for the support and kindness shown to us in recent days,"" she said in her first public comments since his death on April 9 aged 99. ""We have been deeply touched, and continue to be reminded that Philip had such an extraordinary impact on countless people throughout his life.""

The Queen -- Britain's longest-reigning monarch -- said the messages from Britain, the Commonwealth and around the world had been a ""comfort"" during a ""period of great sadness"".

Her birthday falls during a two-week period of royal mourning for Philip, who was interred Saturday in the Royal Vault at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen, seen at the funeral for the first time since his death, cut a solitary figure due to coronavirus restrictions, sitting alone in mourning black, with a white-trimmed, black face mask.

Close family, also masked, were forced to sit socially distanced in the historic 15th-century Gothic chapel during the 50-minute service attended by just 30 guests. With the ongoing restrictions curtailing socialising, her birthday -- typically marked with a traditional gun salute and the release of a new portrait -- will be subdued this year.

Although the grieving monarch returned to public duties a few days after Philip's passing, there are no plans to mark her birthday publicly. In the Buckingham Palace statement, however, she said: ""I have, on the occasion of my 95th birthday today, received many messages of good wishes, which I very much appreciate.""

She is expected to be at Windsor Castle, west of London, where she and the late duke had spent much of the past year shielding due to the pandemic. ""This is going to be a private day for her and that's how it should be,"" said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine.

""I think she will be personally devastated by this, but I don't think the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, her husband of 73 years, is going to impact on her working role. ""There's the public queen and there's the private queen, and she's great at being able to compartmentalise.""

'Huge void'

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted ""warm wishes"" to the monarch. ""I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country.

""I am proud to serve as her Prime Minister,"" he wrote.

The Queen, now in the twilight of her reign, married Philip in November 1947, nearly five years before she succeeded her father, king George VI. She has previously described him as her ""strength and stay"" during seven decades of almost constant presence at her side.

Senior royals have conceded his death has left a ""huge void"" in the Queen's life, and have reportedly been sharing responsibility to comfort her at Windsor.

The Queen and Philip's grandson Prince Harry , 36, flew back from the United States for the funeral, but returned home again to be with his pregnant wife Meghan before his grandmother's birthday, according to The Sun.

Saturday was Harry's first public meeting with the family since a reported falling out over his shock move to California, and his stinging criticism of royal life, including accusations of racism in the institution.

He reportedly spent several hours with his father and heir to the throne Prince Charles, and elder brother Prince William following the ceremony, prompting speculation that any enduring rift is being healed.

LONDON: European Union officials unveiled proposals Wednesday for reining in high-risk uses of artificial intelligence such as live facial scanning that could threaten people's safety or rights.

The draft regulations from the EU's executive commission include rules on the use of the rapidly expanding technology in activities such as choosing school, job or loan applicants. They also would ban artificial intelligence outright in a few situations, such as ""social scoring"" and systems used to manipulate human behavior.

The proposals are the 27-nation bloc's latest move to maintain its role as the world's standard-bearer for technology regulation. EU officials say they are taking a ""risk-based approach"" as they try to balance the need to protect rights such as data privacy against the need to encourage innovation.

""With these landmark rules, the EU is spearheading the development of new global norms to make sure AI can be trusted,"" Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission 's executive vice president for the digital age, said in a statement. ""By setting the standards, we can pave the way for to ethical technology worldwide and ensure that the EU remains competitive along the way.""

The proposals also include a prohibition in principle on ""remote biometric identification,"" such as the use of live facial recognition on crowds of people in public places, with exceptions only for narrowly defined law enforcement purposes such as searching for a missing child or a wanted person.

The draft regulations say chatbots and deepfakes should be labeled so people know they are interacting with a machine.

Australia on Wednesday cancelled two deals struck by its state of Victoria with China on Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, prompting the Chinese embassy in Canberra to warn that already tense bilateral ties were bound to worsen.

Under a new process in Australia, Foreign Minister Marise Payne has the power to review deals reached with other nations by the country's states and universities.

Payne said she had decided to cancel four deals, including two that Victoria agreed with China, in 2018 and 2019, on cooperation with the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping 's signature trade and infrastructure scheme.

""I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,"" she said in a statement.

China's embassy in Australia voiced its ""strong displeasure and resolute opposition"" to the cancellations late on Wednesday.

""This is another unreasonable and provocative move taken by the Australian side against China,"" the embassy said in a statement. ""It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations.""

Bilateral ties were strained in 2018 when Australia became the first country to publicly ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network. Relations worsened last year when Canberra called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.

Australia's latest move ""is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself,"" the Chinese embassy said.

Australia's federal parliament granted the veto power over foreign deals by states in December amid the deepening diplomatic spat with China, which has imposed a series of trade sanctions on Australian exports ranging from wine to coal.

Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull had declined to agree to a country-level MOU with China on the Belt and Road Initiative.

But Victoria's Labor state premier Dan Andrews signed agreements with China's National Development and Reform Commission to promote the initiative in 2018 and 2019.

Some countries fear the lending the Belt and Road scheme entails could lead to unsustainable debt levels in developing nations, including the Pacific islands region.

Morrison's government has denied that its new veto power is aimed at China, Australia's largest trading partner and biggest source of overseas universities students before the pandemic led the country to close its borders.

Payne said states, local governments and publicly funded universities had notified her of more than 1,000 foreign deals overall.

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday expelled an Antigua-registered ship that entered the island's territory without declaring a radioactive cargo bound for China.

The country's Atomic Energy Regulatory Council said the MV BBC Naples was asked to leave after it was found to be in the Chinese-run port of Hambantota on Tuesday night carrying uranium hexafluoride.

""The ship failed to declare its dangerous cargo - uranium hexafluoride - and we decided to order it to leave our waters immediately,"" council director general Anil Ranjith told AFP.

The ship had come from Rotterdam but authorities did not say where in China it was headed.

Ranjith said it was an offence to enter a port without declaring the material, which is used to enrich uranium, the fuel for nuclear power stations and weapons.

Sri Lanka's opposition leader Sajith Premadasa demanded an investigation into the incident, describing it as a serious safety threat.

""The navy has not been allowed to board the vessel to carry out an inspection,"" Premadasa said.

There was no immediate comment from the government.

Hambantota port was leased to China in 2017 for 99 years after the Colombo government was unable to repay $1.4 million it had borrowed from Beijing to build it.

Hambantota, about 260 kilometres (162 miles) south of Colombo, is near key Indian Ocean shipping lanes.

The entry of two Chinese submarines into Colombo in 2014 angered neighbouring India, the traditional regional power which is competing with Beijing for influence in the Indian Ocean.

Since then, Sri Lanka has not allowed Chinese submarine visits.

BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping will take part in US President Joe Biden 's climate summit being organised virtually on Thursday and Friday in which several world leaders , including Prime Minister Narendra Modi , will participate.

At the invitation of Biden, President Xi will attend and deliver an ""important speech"" at the Leaders' Summit on Climate on Thursday by video link from Beijing, the Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday.

Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including PM Modi, to the two-day conference beginning April 22, which according to a While House statement will underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.

It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow, the statement said.

Chinese experts consider invitation to Xi for the summit as a positive signal for the China-US relationship, facing growing tensions on a number of issues like Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The Chinese top leader's attendance was confirmed just a day before the summit, and a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed he will be speaking at the summit, showing that the two countries are willing to take part in global efforts to address the climate issue despite tensions with the US, state-run Global Times daily reported.

The US and China are the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases.

Former US President Donald Trump withdrew America from the Paris Climate deal but Biden announced the return of the US to the Paris climate accord after he took over the presidency. Climate change has been a major area of focus for Biden.

Ahead of the US-led climate summit, Xi held a video summit exchanging in-depth views and reaching a consensus for cooperation on climate change with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

China's attendance signals that cooperation between China and the US is still the mainstream tone, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations of the China Foreign Affairs University, told the daily.

""The attendance of our leader can also reassure other countries, as the world anxiously needs a strong voice on this issue,"" Li said.

THE HAGUE: In an unprecedented vote Wednesday, member states of the global chemical weapons watchdog suspended Syria 's voting rights at the organization as a punishment for the repeated use of toxic gas by Damascus.

The vote, which required a two-thirds majority to pass, marked the first time a member state of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been hit with such a sanction.

A group of 46 nations called for the step on Tuesday at the organization's annual meeting of member states. Behind the scenes diplomatic efforts to reach consensus on the proposal failed, leading to a vote Wednesday at which 87 nations voted in favor of suspending Syria's rights and 15 voted against. There were 34 abstentions.

In a tweet, the British delegation to the meeting called the decision a ""Vital step to maintain credibility of Chemical Weapons Convention .""

Syria didn't immediately react at the meeting in The Hague.

France 's ambassador, Luis Vassy, introduced the proposed suspension on Tuesday, saying that Syria's use of prohibited chemical weapons was ""irrefutable.""

Vassy tweeted that Wednesday's vote was a ""good day for multilateralism.""

Syria, which joined the organization in 2013 after being threatened with airstrikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of the country's capital, denounced the move as a ""propaganda tool"" and denied using chemical weapons.

An investigation mechanism set up by the OPCW has twice blamed Syrian government forces for chemical attacks. Last week, it said it found ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that a Syrian air force military helicopter dropped a chlorine cylinder on a Syrian town in 2018, sickening 12 people.

Last year, the team found reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Force was responsible for attacks using chlorine and the nerve agent sarin in March 2017 in the town of Latamneh.

The investigative team was established after Russia blocked the extension of a joint investigation mechanism set up by the United Nations and OPCW in 2015. That mechanism accused Syria of chemical weapons attacks, including unleashing sarin in an aerial attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that killed about 100 people.

","Saudi Arabia has sought talks with Iran as the kingdom tries to end its years-long war in Yemen against Iran-b... Read More

BAGHDAD: The first round of direct talks between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran signaled a possible de-escalation following years of animosity that often spilled into neighboring countries and at least one still-raging war. But few expect quick results.

The talks, hosted by Iraq earlier this month, were confirmed Tuesday to The Associated Press by an Iraqi and a Western official in Baghdad.

They came as the Biden administration paves the way for re-opening diplomatic channels in the region. Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its regional position after losing an unflinching supporter in president Joe Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump . Iran, meanwhile, has calculated that a gradual detente with Riyadh, a long-time US ally, will work in its favor during renewed nuclear talks with Washington and world powers.

Saudi Arabia has sought talks with Iran as the kingdom tries to end its years-long war in Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. In recent months, the Houthis have increasingly launched missiles and bomb-laden drones at the kingdom, targeting crucial sites and oil infrastructure. Ending that war could be a bargaining chip for the Iranians as they seek sanctions relief from nuclear talks in Vienna.

The hosting of Saudi-Iran talks is also a significant step for Iraq, which has ties with both the US and Iran and has often borne the brunt of Saudi-Iran rivalry.

A senior Iraqi official said recent trips by prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi to Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates have been key in bringing Iranian and Saudi interlocutors to the table.

Details of the initial meeting, first reported by The Financial Times , have been sparse. The thorny subject of the Yemen war figured prominently, the Iraqi official said. The Saudi-Iran rivalry has played out on multiple fronts, mostly in Yemen, as well as in Iraq and Lebanon - both home to powerful Iran-backed militias. A breakthrough in Iran-Saudi talks could have far-reaching repercussions in those countries and across the region.

It was not clear how much progress, if any, was made in the talks, but the Western diplomat suggested there will be more meetings. The pro-Iran Lebanese newspaper, al-Akhbar, said a new round of talks would be held in Baghdad next week, following a ""very positive"" first meeting.

""My understanding is that these talks will be ongoing and mediated by Baghdad,"" the diplomat said. Both the diplomat and Iraqi official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secretive contacts with the media. They declined to elaborate, saying they wanted to give Iraqi mediation efforts a chance to succeed.

Neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia has offered official confirmation that the talks took place, though Iranian officials have alluded to them, and welcomed them.

The Iranian ambassador to Iraq on Tuesday praised Baghdad's recent diplomatic efforts, hinting at the Saudi-Iran talks without mentioning the kingdom.

""It seems that the regional and international situation has created a more positive atmosphere for the resolution of some problems between Iran and other nations,"" Iraj Masjedi told the state-run IRNA news agency in an interview in Baghdad.

""We would be happy if Iraq could be able to play any role in the direction of Iran's closeness with nations that we have some challenges with.""

When asked whether Iraq's mediation has borne fruit, he said the talks ""have not reached any clear result and not met any remarkable progress.""

Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals. Relations worsened considerably in 2016 when Riyadh removed its diplomats after protesters attacked its embassy in Tehran and consulate in Mashhad in retaliation for the kingdom's executing the Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Those posts have remained closed ever since. At the time, Iraq offered itself as a possible mediator between the two countries.

Apart from Iraqi lobbying efforts, other key shifts in the wake of the Biden presidency paved the way for the talks.

Saudi Arabia is seeking to improve relations with the Biden administration which, unlike the Trump administration, has criticized the kingdom's human rights record, particularly after the 2018 killing of dissident Saudi writer and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Saudis also want to test ""whether Iranians have control over the Houthis, whether they are willing to exercise it,"" said Randa Slim, director of the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute. ""It's a testing phase of wills and interest.""

Meanwhile, changes in Iran's handling of Iraq also played a role. The intelligence arm of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard held sway over Iraq through Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. But Soleimani's killing in a 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad has seen Iran's Intelligence Ministry grow more powerful there, said the Iraqi official.

The Guard reports directly to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and holds hard-line views. The Intelligence Ministry reports to Iran's relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani. While cooperating, the two services are rivals within Iran's theocracy.

This change of guard was key in bringing Iranians to the table in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said.

""They have a new view, a new discourse, they want a stronger Iraq,"" one Iraqi official said of the Intelligence Ministry officials. ""The (Guard) calculated differently, they wanted the opposite, a weak Iraq was more beneficial to them.""","<p>Zalmay Khalilzad. AP Photo<br></p>

WASHINGTON: As the US moves to withdraw its military from Afghanistan over the next five months, concerns are growing about one American who risks being left behind.

Mark Frerichs, a contractor from Lombard, Illinois, believed held for more than a year by the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani network, was not mentioned in President Joe Biden 's address on Afghanistan last week. Nor was the troop withdrawal, scheduled to be complete by Sept. 11, conditioned on his release from custody, fueling concerns that the U.S. could lose bargaining power to get Frerichs home once its military presence is removed from the country.

""Any leverage that we had, we've just now announced to the world and to the Taliban and the Haqqanis that we're going to pull out. Not only is it our leverage, it's our military capability to rescue him,"" Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Green Beret who served in Afghanistan, said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""So it's just utterly disheartening.""

The Biden administration has said it regards the return of hostages to be a top priority. Despite this, the fate of a single captive is unlikely to sway the broader policy interest in ending a 20-year war that began in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It's not uncommon for detainee issues to be eclipsed by other foreign policy matters, as appeared to happen last week when the administration didn't mention Russia's detention of two Americans, even as it announced reasons for taking punitive action against Moscow.

Even so, for Frerichs' family, the failure to make his return a factor in the withdrawal is a source of frustration, as is the fact that the Trump administration signed a peace deal in February 2020, just weeks after Frerichs vanished in Afghanistan while working on engineering projects in the country.

His sister, Charlene Cakora, said in a statement that the military withdrawal ""puts a time stamp on Mark. We have 150 days to get him home or our leverage is gone.""

Frerichs' home-state senators, Democrats Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin, had raised similar concerns in a letter earlier this year to Biden.

In an interview Monday, Duckworth said she's been reassured by the administration that Frerichs has been part of the discussions and that officials are aware of his case. She said she spoke privately with Biden himself last Thursday, handing him a card with information about the case.

""He said he was very well aware and he asked me to also let the family know that he was aware and was on top of it,"" Duckworth said.

The US has not disclosed much about Frerichs' fate or status but confirmed Monday that there were active discussions with the Taliban.

State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, working closely with Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, ""has continued to press the Taliban for Mr. Frerichs' release, and continues to raise his status in senior level engagements in Doha and Islamabad. We place a high priority on Mark Frerichs' safety and will not stop working until he is safely returned to his family.""

The AP reported in January that the Taliban during the Trump administration had sought the release of a combatant imprisoned on drug charges in the US as part of a broader effort to resolve issues with Afghanistan. The request prompted dialogue between the State Department and the Justice Department about whether such a release could happen, though it ultimately did not.

Duckworth, who has discussed the case with Khalilzad, said the Taliban remained ""insistent"" on that release and had not moved off of their position.

The withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of two significant foreign policy moves announced by Biden last week. The other involved sanctions on Russia for election interference and for the hack of federal government agencies.

The White House did not use that opportunity to call out Moscow for what US officials say is the unjust detention of at least two Americans: Paul Whelan, a corporate security executive from Michigan sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, and Trevor Reed, a Marine veteran who was convicted in an altercation with police in Russia and sentenced to nine years.

Whelan's brother, David, said in a statement last week that he was hopeful for rapprochement between Moscow and Washington but also concerned that the tit-for-tat actions - Russia responded to the US sanctions by announcing its own expulsion of diplomats - may have made that more challenging.

""First, the sanctions continue to make it difficult for the two nations to create the relationship and dialogue necessary to create conditions that might lead to Paul's release,"" Whelan wrote. ""Second, the winnowing of US Embassy staff in Russia will make the difficult work of consular support even harder.""

The yatra is slated to start from May 14.

COVID-19 norms were openly flouted during the Haridwar Kumbh Mela. A majority of the 48.51 lakh people who took part in the last two royal baths (shahi snan) held on the occasion of Somwati Amavasya on April 12 and Mesh Sankranti on April 14 were seen without masks and did not maintain social distancing.

The court also directed the state government to step up COVID-19 testing by deploying mobile vans in interior regions and increase the number of COVID hospitals besides supplying adequate PPE kits and other safety equipment to health workers.

The high court directed the state government to take the help of central agencies to build temporary hospitals and admit patients suffering from coronavirus.

The court also said that government hospitals must be equipped with CT Scan machines and 25 per cent of the beds in private hospitals be reserved for people holding BPL cards.

The court enquired about availability of vaccines and Remdesivir injection in the state. The state has also been directed to publish information of all hospitals and vaccination centres online for easy access.

""We are shocked and dismayed that the government does not seem to be mindful and sentitive enough to the extreme and emergent needs of medical oxygen by hospitals which are treating serious Covid patients,"" the bench remarked.

""The government can very well divert the production of oxygen by steel and petroleum industries, which are producing it for captive use. We are therefore constrained to direct the Central government to implement this order to take over the supplies and production of oxygen from steel and pertoleum plants, even if means that such industries have to stop their production for some time,"" the high court ordered.

Around 10.20 p.m. on Tuesday, Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that oxygen stock in GTB Hospital, the second largest Delhi government hospital, may not last beyond 2 a.m. on Wednesday and sought help from the Central government.

Earlier on Tuesday, multiple hospitals in the city said that their oxygen stock would last only for 7-12 hours and “people will die” if they did not get oxygen.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also reiterated there was a serious oxygen crisis and again sought help from the Central government. “Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge Centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen,” he said in a tweet on Tuesday.","Food and lodging at over 200 night shelters from today

Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal decided to constitute a committee for the welfare of migrant workers in the Capital on Tuesday.

Principal Secretary (Home) Bhupinder Singh Bhalla would head the committee as nodal officer while Special Commissioner of Police (Central Range) Rajesh Khurana would be the nodal officer from Delhi Police.

According to government sources, measures such as direct cash transfer of ₹5,000 into the bank accounts of workers registered with the government and arrangements for food and lodging at over 200 night shelters would begin by Wednesday.

“I appeal to all the migrant citizens of Delhi not to leave Delhi in panic. I assure you that the government will take care of your needs. All necessary arrangements are being ensured. You run Delhi with your tireless hard work and this city is your own,” Mr. Baijal said in his appeal to migrant workers.

Floating tenders

Government sources said Mr. Baijal had on Tuesday directed the Divisional Commissioner and the Delhi Chief Secretary to float tenders to select NGOs to step up provisions for food and lodging to migrant workers fleeing the city. The L-G also directed the Delhi Police Commissioner to instruct personnel to counsel workers to stay back.

According to the Delhi government, direct cash benefits of ₹10,000 were transferred to the accounts of 47,247 registered workers as COVID relief in two separate instalment during the nation wide lockdown last year.

The total number of registered workers in the city as on date was 1,71,861. The cash benefits would be provided from the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board.

Contractors providing food to government schools under the mid-day meal scheme would be roped in to provide food to workers and daily wagers and 24x7 helpline would also be set up to act as a grievance management system, which would be shared through SMS. While 207 night shelters would initially accommodate workers, government schools and other facilities would soon be converted into lodging.

BJP knocks at L-G’s door

Meanwhile, State BJP leaders held a videoconference meeting with L-G over problems being faced by citizens, especially COVID-19 patients and migrant labourers.

MPs Manoj Tiwari, Meenakshi Lekhi, Ramesh Bidhuri, Parvesh Sahib Singh, Gautam Gambhir and MLAs Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Vijender Gupta among others were part of the meeting.

According to the party, BJP leaders sought to stress that this was the time for cohesive working but the Delhi government was neither improving the situation nor readying to involve the opposition.

During last year’s COVID lockdown, they said, the civic bodies played a prominent role in helping people but this time the Delhi government was not involving them and requested the formation of COVID sections in corporation hospitals as well as quarantine centres.

In his capacity as head of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, the leaders asked the L-G to ensure coordination at various administrative levels to help the people.","Lockdown and barricades are not deterring them from reaching transport hubs

Despite the Capital literally locked down with checkposts on all major roads preventing people from moving out without a reason, inter-state transport hubs were brimming with migrant workers making a desperate dash for their home States.

While at Anand Vihar ISBT and railway station the crowd had thinned from the footfall soon after the lockdown was announced, migrant workers continued to try and find ways to manage transport to ferry them out of the city. Some had camped overnight at the terminal hoping to find a commute to reach home while hundreds continued to arrive.

Mohd. Faizan, a resident of Gaya who is a construction supervisor, said he did not have a confirmed ticket but was willing to pay “double fine” to reach home as his employer had told him that he was not going to be paid during the week. “My employer clearly told me that I will not be paid. What is the use of staying back? If things get better, I can return within a few days but without work, what is the point of staying back? We are only here to earn money,” said Mr. Faizan, adding that he was scared of the virus but getting infected at home was better than falling ill in the city.

Deja vu

For many, the announcement of the six-day lockdown took them back to last year’s lockdown when trains and buses were halted immediately. “With no income, what will we do staying here? This virus has ruined our lives and will ruin it further. My family tells me that the situation back home is not as bad as it is in Delhi, so I am going home. Most people are here out of fear and are willing to take the risk of travelling home,” said Prashant, who works as a help in a hardware shop, and is looking to head back to Almora.

With autorickshaws still allowed to ply, people arriving at transport hubs were taking them till the nearest barricade and walking to the station from there. Mahesh Kumar, an auto driver, said that police at barricades were taking a humane view on those trying to reach transport hubs.

“I am on the road because I also need to run my house. Many people taking autos want to go to hospitals or clinics. It was the same during the weekend as well. I am putting myself at risk, but I want to earn a living while I still can drive my auto,” Mr. Kumar said.

Long queues

At the New Delhi Railway Station, long queues had formed outside with people jostling to get onto a home-bound train. Those without a ticket were hopeful to get access to the platform and board a train heading out of the city but said that they were determined to leave the city as staying back was pointless.

“Trains and buses are still running. It is better to leave now than getting stuck here for a long time. I do not believe in the assurances by the govt. that they will not extend it. Have they even announced that they will provide shelter and food? We are on our own and it is better to head home while we still can,” said Ram Kishan, waiting for a train to Darbhanga. He adds that once he has made it to the train station, he will find some “jugaad” to get home.","Be polite but firm, said Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava while reviewing the situation on the first day of the week-long lockdown.

Mr. Shrivastava also asked the field officers to make use of announcements in colonies and densely populated areas for people to obey the curfew. Anyone venturing out of home will be definitely checked by the personnel and questioned, the police said.

“The priority is to implement the week-long lockdown and restrictions are to be maintained,” he said, adding that if anyone is found to disobey the restrictions without having a genuine ground, “needs to be prosecuted at once”.

Expressing “concern” for police personnel on ground, he said, “Being front-line warriors, our personnel need to perform their duties, but also ensure COVID-19 safety”.

He told the unit officers to keep sufficient stock of equipment like PPE kits, masks, sanitisers and pay attention to repeated cleanliness of toilets and common areas of the barracks and police stations.

“Daily health monitoring of the staff should be carried out. Police colonies should also be sanitised because officers return homes from duties. Officers should remain in communication with staffers who have fallen ill and make best possible arrangements for their treatment,” he said.","It is providing meals to infected patients without caregivers

The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) on Tuesday began langar services to provide cooked meals to those migrants and other needy people waiting at New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations and Anand Vihar bus terminus.

The meals are being prepared at the Bangla Sahib Gurdwara and then distributed across the city by volunteers, said DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa.

“Several migrants have started returning to their hometowns in the fear of remaining hungry in the city. In order to ensure that nobody in the city sleeps hungry, food for thousands of people is being prepared and packed at Bangla Sahib,” said Mr. Singh.

The DSGMC has started providing cooked meals to COVID-19 patients who do not have caregivers at home.

Requests received

Stating that several requests had been received by the DSGMC from such families and patients, Mr. Singh said: “We received hundreds of calls to help patients who have no one at home to look after them. We have set up a mechanism to pack and send food for them. On the first day itself, we had around 100 volunteers delivering across the city.”

The DSGMC had provided cooked meals during the lockdown last year as well. Mr. Singh proudly said that one day they fed as many as 1.75 lakh people, their highest tally. “The food is being prepared in utmost hygienic conditions and in automatic machines. We urge people to inform us about any family who is in need and requires packed meals. We shall reach out to them and continue our sewa. We are also distributing food among the JJ clusters too,” said Mr. Singh.","Delhi Police comes to the rescue of over 235 COVID-19 patients

As the Capital grapples with oxygen crisis, the Delhi police on Tuesday created a green corridor for oxygen tankers to travel from two borders.

DCP (Outer) Parvinder Singh said that around 11.30 p.m. on Monday night, they were informed by the Medical Superintendent of Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute in Paschim Vihar that the hospital had critical level of oxygen in their liquid gas tank and the lives of over 235 COVID-19 patients were at risk.

“The hospital further informed that one of the tankers carrying 14,000 litre of oxygen that was supposed to be brought from Pari Chowk in Greater Noida was stuck near the border due to COVID-related restrictions and another one carrying 5,500 litres of oxygen which was to come from Faridabad, was stuck on the Delhi-Faridabad border,” the DCP said.

Teams sent to border

Two teams were sent to Pari Chowk and Badarpur border with instructions to facilitate movement by creating a green corridor after which both tankers reached the hospital.

Besides this, the police managed to send oxygen cylinders from other hospitals too. They sent 10 oxygen cylinders from Saroj Hospital, 15 from Agrasen Hospital, five from ILBS Vasant Kunj and 10 from Fortis Hospital to meet the requirement and save 235 patients.

In a separate incident, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Anto Alphonse himself arranged oxygen for a private hospital in Gulabi Bagh. With his team, he went to Mayapuri to facilitate filling of oxygen cylinders and went to the hospital to deliver them.","38 officers have died of COVID-19 so far

A 38-year-old Delhi Police Head Constable died of COVID-19 on Tuesday. With little luck at five hospitals in the Capital, his family took him to three hospitals in Meerut before finding a bed.

Hailing from Meerut, Harish Tanwar was a resident of north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar and was posted in Outer North Delhi’s Samaipur Badli police station and was on duty till April 14.

After completing his night duty, he returned home and felt feverish. He had fever for three days, but on Sunday evening, he started facing breathing problems,” said deceased’s cousin Sanjay Kumar. He is an assistant sub-inspector in the force.

Tried many hospitals

Recalling the ordeal, Harish’s brother Ompal, a DTC staffer who was with him throughout this time, said that he and a few others tried over five hospitals in Delhi starting Sunday evening till late into the night but couldn’t get help.

“All his seniors were aware of his situation and knew that we were looking for a hospital but nobody helped. But who can you blame when everyone else is facing the same problem,” the brother said.

“Because we couldn’t get a bed here in Delhi, we had to take a huge risk of taking him in that situation to Meerut. There as well, we had to make many calls to get admission in hospitals,” Mr. Ompal said.

Harish was first admitted in Santosh Hospital where his COVID-19 test was conducted and around 4 p.m., he tested positive. “The doctors said that his lungs were 90% damaged and they referred him to a better facility,” Mr. Kumar said.

Later, Harish was taken to IIMT Life Line Hospital where the family was allegedly told that they don’t have ventilator support but the hospital helped them find a bed in Sudha Hospital where the required system was available.

“Harish’s oxygen level kept dropping and he died around 2 a.m.,” Mr. Kumar said, adding that Harish was cremated on Tuesday morning.

He is survived by his parents, wife and two minor children. “They have a small piece of land. He was essentially managing the house because farming didn’t yield a lot of money,” he said.

Harish had joined Delhi Police in 2003 as constable and was promoted to Head Constable in 2014, the family said.

A total of 38 officers have died of COVID-19 in the force so far.","They are left with no choice but to work more hours and during weekends

From increased working hours to doctors and nurses testing positive, doctors of several hospitals said they were stretched for resources due to the record spike in COVID-19 cases in the city.

Some doctors said there is heavy rush in the emergency and others said that they have no option but to turn patients away as they do not have any vacant beds.

A doctor at Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) said their manpower is stretched due to increased workload. All 450 ICU beds of the hospital were occupied as on Tuesday night.

“We have been working at full capacity for about 10 days. People are working for longer hours and our resources are stretched. The Delhi government is providing us with medical officers [doctors]. But we need specialist doctors,” she said.

The doctor said they are also trying to increase the oxygen capacity of the hospital to meet the increased workload. She said that patient satisfaction is another issue. “Since the attendant is not with the patient, she gets uneasy and complains about things which may be a non issue. That pressure also comes to us.”

‘Like a war zone’

Vikas Maurya, Head of Department of Pulmonology at Fortis Hospital in Shalimar Bagh, said that beds are filling up as soon as a patient is discharged. They have a waiting list of patients.

“The manpower is the same and many staffers are also testing positive. We don’t have any choice, but to work more hours and during weekends. It is like a war zone and we all are on our toes,” Dr. Maurya said.

100 queries a day

He said that the 60 beds in the ICU have been full for more than a week and they get more than 100 queries a day for beds.

“We are taking one day at a time. All our beds have been more or less full for the past one week. People are working extended hours and on Sunday and on odd hours. But still we have to turn away some people as beds are full. It is inevitable,” said a senior doctor from Aakash Healthcare.","Working on a war footing to ensure oxygen supply, he says at review meeting

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday convened a review meeting in which he directed officials to increase oxygen beds across several facilities in the city. He said the Delhi government was working on a war footing to ensure oxygen supply in the city.

Following the meeting, Mr. Kejriwal raised serious concerns over acute oxygen shortage across various COVID-19 facilities in Delhi and urged the Centre to urgently provide oxygen since some hospitals were left with just a few hours’ supply.

“Had a review meeting with officials on the current situation of Corona. We are working on a war footing to ensure oxygen supply in Delhi, and are also talking to the central government. An increase in the number of oxygen beds is happening on a large scale,” he tweeted.

In another development later in the day, Health Minister Satyendar Jain tweeted: “Acute shortage of oxygen at GTB Hospital. Oxygen may not last beyond 4 hrs. More than 500 corona patients on oxygen. Pl help @PiyushGoyal to restore oxygen supply to avert major crisis [sic].”

A message from the head of the hospital to the Minister said that a private company in U.P. was not being allowed to send oxygen to Delhi.

“Over 241 metric tonne and 355 MT are the oxygen supplies provided to Delhi against a daily requirement of 700 MT. The figure of 508 MT is wrong as right now the stock position in most of the hospitals, public or private, is not more than 10 to 12 hours. This is when each hospital is required to maintain minimum three days of stock position of oxygen,” he said.","Bench also takes note of ‘vaccine wastage’, asks govt. to ensure every vial is used fully

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to immediately ban industrial use of oxygen instead of waiting till April 22, remarking that “economic interest cannot override lives, otherwise we are waiting for a much bigger disaster”.

“The shortage is now. Why wait till April 22 to decide?” the HC said, adding, “At this point of time, the highest priority has to be saving lives.”

“The government imposed a lockdown last year, which faced a lot of criticism, but if we look back, it was probably the wisest decision the government made,” the Bench said. “The situation today is much more demanding. If there was justification for lockdown last year, it is four times more today,” it added.

The HC also directed the Centre to meet the representatives of steel and petrochemical industries to temporarily divert a portion of their oxygen for medical needs. “We want the Centre to consider issuing order to steel and petrochemical industries so that a fine balance can be struck between the needs of the people at large and the needs of the industry,” it said.

Citing the ordeal of a Central government counsel whose father is in the hospital and is being provided oxygen at reduced pressure to conserve it, the Bench said: “The situation is such that oxygen pressure has to be reduced for it to last longer, with the result that serious patients in need of oxygen have suffered. This is turning out to be one of the major causes of fatalities in COVID-19 patients.”

During the hearing, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, submitted that 673 metric tonne of oxygen is needed for ICU patients in Delhi, and 280 metric tonne of oxygen for non-ICU patients. “Two days back the Delhi government had written for 700 metric tonne of oxygen, on Tuesday, it is 973 metric tonne. If we don’t do something today and leave it for tomorrow, this will jump to 1,100 and then 1,200 and then every single hospital will be without oxygen,” Mr. Mehra said.

Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, representing the Ministry of Health, said there has been an inordinate increase of 133% in the projected medical oxygen required as on April 20, between the initial estimate of 300 metric tonne and revised estimate of 700 metric tonne submitted by Delhi.

“All the States, including Delhi, have been advised to rationalise the use of oxygen and prohibit abnormal usage and administering oxygen to patients who do not clinically require it,” the Ministry said in its affidavit.

The High Court will hear the case again on April 22.

Vaccine wastage

The Bench also took note of news reports that there is daily wastage of “6% of vaccines, and till now 44 lakh vaccines out of 10 crore have been wasted, maximum in Tamil Nadu”. The HC said wastage of even a single shot of the COVID-19 vaccine was a “criminal waste” and directed the Centre to vaccinate whomsoever it can to ensure each vial is used fully.

“Give it to those who want it. Whomsoever you can vaccinate, please vaccinate. Whether 16 years old or 60, all need vaccination. The pandemic does not discriminate,” the Bench said.

It also asked the Centre to devise ways and means to register volunteers between the ages of 18-45 who can be called to take the vaccine, if some doses are left after 5 p.m. each day. “That would ensure all doses are fully utilised and not wasted. For this purpose the Centre should modify its COWIN application (meant for registering people who want to get vaccinated),” the Bench said.","99.4% of total 4,595 ICU beds occupied, only 31 vacant: govt.

The Capital reported 277 COVID-19-related deaths and 28,395 new cases in 24 hours — the highest figures since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a health bulletin released by the Delhi government on Tuesday.

The total number of deaths went up to 12,638 and cases to 9,05,541. A total of 86,526 tests were done in a day, the bulletin said.

Positivity rate

The positivity of new cases also jumped to 32.82%, which means that 32 out of 100 people taking the test are now positive.

Of the total cases, 8,07,328 people have recovered and there are 85,575 active cases.

A total of 59,491 beneficiaries took the COVID-19 vaccination in the city in 24 hours, as per the bulletin.

After the peak in November, the number of cases had gradually decreased. New cases were falling in early 2021 and on January 16, the number of daily new cases had dropped to 94. But it slowly increased to 200 on February 24 and it has been on the rise since then.

Out of the total 19,608 beds for COVID-19 treatment, only 13.6% were vacant.

Many hospitals, including Lok Nayak Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital and Burari Hospital, did not have a single vacant COVID-19 bed.

Also, 99.4% of the total 4,595 ICU beds were occupied and only — 31 ICU beds — were vacant in Delhi on Tuesday night, as per a government website.

2,700 more beds

In another development, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that around 2,700 more COVID-19 hospital beds will be added in a week.

Some of these beds were announced earlier, but they are in the process of being added.

“In the last two weeks, the number of COVID-19-designated beds in Delhi have been increased by three times. The number of COVID-19 beds in Delhi was 6,071 on April 3, 2021, but it was increased to 19,101 on April 20,” he said.

Action against hospitals

The Minister said that action will be taken against hospitals which do not give proper information about beds and action has been taken against two hospitals.

“Doctors and the medical staff are working tirelessly, keeping their lives at stake. They are saving thousands of lives, we are obliged to them,” Mr. Sisodia said after visiting Dr Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital.","Kejriwal appeals to Centre again; orders placed with Union govt., says CMO

Multiple government hospitals in the city said that their oxygen stock will last only for “7-12 hours” and COVID-19 patients will succumb if the situation isn’t addressed on priority basis.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal again sought help from the Central government. “I again urge centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen (sic),” he said in a tweet.

Around 10.20 p.m., Health Minister Satyendar Jain, tagging Union Minister Piyush Goyal in a tweet, said oxygen supply in Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, the second largest Delhi government hospital, may not last beyond 2 a.m. on Wednesday.

A list shared by the AAP government showed that in some hospitals, the oxygen stock will last only for four to five hours.

“We need oxygen very badly. Have enough to last only seven to eight hours,” Dr. D.S. Rana, chairman of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the city’s largest private hospitals, told The Hindu. “Around 120 patients in the ICU are heavily dependent on oxygen,” he said.

Supply lines

Dr. Jyoti Mishra, medical superintendent of Aakash Healthcare, another private hospital, said the situation was similar in almost all hospitals. “We do not have oxygen to last more than 12 hours,” he said.

The CM had alleged on Sunday that the oxygen quota of the city has been diverted to other States.

A Ministry of Home Affairs official said on Tuesday that oxygen supply for Delhi was mainly sourced from the neighbouring States, particularly Uttar Pradesh. “We are coordinating with the State governments to ensure that the trucks and vehicles carrying oxygen are not halted or stopped unnecessarily at the borders, but the Delhi government has to place the order,” the official said.

An official working with the CM’s office said that the government has already placed orders with the Central government.","They had signed an MoU in 2019 to strengthen research collaboration

Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi on Tuesday said that the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has announced that it will support eight joint research projects mooted by the Space Technology Cell (STC), IIT-Delhi. The ISRO will support the projects under its RESPOND programme with varying duration of 1-3 years, it added.

The institute said that the Space Technology Cell was set up at IIT, Delhi under an MoU signed between the ISRO and IIT-D in November 2019 with an aim to strengthen the research collaboration between the two organisations and to carry out focused research projects in the space technology domain with specific deliverables. Since then, eight collaborative research projects have been announced.

Some of the projects include developing a system for drought and flood forecasting and understanding land-atmosphere interactions, a project that aims to understand the plasma dynamics in electrode-less thrusters, which are used for electric propulsion and have a longer lifespan than their electrode-based counterparts, an indigenous sensor based real time flood warning smart system and other projects.

V. Ramgopal Rao, IIT-Delhi director said, “IIT-Delhi is committed to taking its interactions with the ISRO to the next level. The institute has some of the world’s experts in various technology domains such as land-surface modelling, remote sensing, molecular dynamics simulations etc. who will extend their expertise to the ISRO and play a key role in making its future endeavours successful.”","DMRC revises frequency schedule for the six-day lockdown

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) on Tuesday said that operational plans for the six-day lockdown had been revised in order to offer more capacity in compliance with the 50% seating provision inside coaches.

According to the new schedule, metro trains will be available at a frequency of 15 minutes during peak hours and during non-peak hours the frequency will be 30 minutes.

In a statement issued, the DMRC said, “Services during morning peak hours — 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. — and evening peak hours — 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. — across the network will be available with a headway [frequency] of 15 minutes. For the rest of the hours of the day, services across the network will be available with a frequency of 30 minutes.”

The DMRC added that standby trains on each line will also be available throughout the day for induction into services as per requirement.

The public transporter had earlier announced that metro trains would be available during peak hours at a frequency of 30 minutes and at a frequency of 60 minutes during non-peak hours, while the six-day lockdown lasted.

On Tuesday morning, the DMRC closed entry gates of several metro stations across the network as a crowd-control measure. Restricted entry was allowed in stations like Rajiv Chowk, MG Road, New Delhi and Chandni Chowk.

Entry to stations like Shadipur, Dwarka Mor, Tagore Garden, Rajouri Garden, Patel Nagar, Bahadurgarh City, among other stations, were also closed temporarily by the DMRC to ensure social distancing inside metro stations.

During the lockdown period, only those under the exempted category are permitted to avail metro services on production of valid identity cards.","Urban lockdown for a week in Mizoram, Arunachal advances school vacations

From urban lockdown in Mizoram to advanced summer vacation for schools in Arunachal Pradesh and partial attendance in educational institutions and offices in Assam, the northeastern States have taken diverse actions in a bid to check the surge in COVID-19 cases.

Data with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said COVID-19 claimed nine lives in three of the eight northeastern States on April 19 — seven of them in Assam — as the region recorded 1,333 active cases.

Officials in States such as Meghalaya said the rate of infection over the past few days has been six times more than the corresponding period in 2020. The surge has forced Meghalaya and its northeastern neighbours to go for a series of restrictive measures to contain the spread of the “new strain” of the virus.

Apart from night curfew, Meghalaya has closed down all schools in State capital Shillong till May 3, besides barring the entry of tourists for 14 days from April 23.

Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said: “It took 114 days for Meghalaya to cross 600 positive cases in 2020, but it has taken only 25 days this time to record 680 cases.”

Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura governments have also closed down all educational institutions — up to Class 8 in some cases — for periods ranging from seven days to an indefinite period. Mizoram has also imposed lockdown in State capital Aizawl and 10 district headquarters while asking smaller towns and rural areas to carry on with public activities by adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour.

Arunachal Pradesh, among the least affected States, has decided to advance the summer vacation of schools by a month. Educational institutions, including Rajiv Gandhi University, have been asked to complete all physical classes and examinations by April 30.

“We are not going for night curfew and lockdown, but all educational institutions up to university-level will remain closed indefinitely,” said Tripura Education Minister and government spokesman Ratan Lal Nath.

Curbs in Assam

The Assam government too has ruled out lockdown, but has ordered all shops and business establishments to be closed by 6 p.m.

This was among a slew of restrictions “with immediate effect” that Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua announced on Tuesday.

While students up to Class 5 have been asked to stay home, educational institutions have been told to conduct classes with 50% of students on alternate days.

The 50% rule has also been applied to public modes of transport and to government and private offices too, barring banks and other essential services.","Despite COVID-19 cases rising sharply and a large number of consequential deaths occurring in different districts, the consolidated information disseminated by Odisha government has put the death toll on the lower side, fuelling suspicion about under-reporting of fatalities.

Since April 1, the State government has reported 32 deaths due to COVIDfrom across 30 districts. However, information trickling in from districts about fatalities is vastly different from the State government’s claim.

“As many as 19 patients, who were admitted in our centre, have died. Only six deaths have been audited,” said Sudhir Ranjan Nayak, who heads Nuapada COVID-19 Hospital.","Lal says no shortage of oxygen supply

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Tuesday said no lockdown would be imposed in the State but there would be strict compliance with COVID-19 guidelines.

The Chief Minister, addressing a live telecast programme, urged the labourers and workers to not panic. “Adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that no labourer and worker face any problem. This time, keeping the interest of the labourers and workers, especially those working on daily and monthly wages, no lockdown would be imposed in Haryana,” said the Chief Minister.

“To ensure adequate medical arrangement for COVID-19 patients, the State government has recently held discussion with the DRDO officials for setting up a 500-1,000 bedded dedicated COVID hospital in Panipat,” he added.

He said there is a steady increase in COVID-19 cases, which is a serious matter of concern. “In the last one and a half months, the number of new infection cases has reached about 7000 in one day. To deal with this emergent situation a state-level COVID Monitoring Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Health Minister Anil Vij,” said the Chief Minister.

Mr. Lal said: “There is no shortage of oxygen supply. Liquid oxygen is being produced in the oxygen plant at Panipat. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to ensure the availability of oxygen in gas form,” he said.

Separately, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said at present there are about 42,000 active cases in the State out of which about 30,000 are in home isolation.","The petitioner told the court that most of the hospitals in the network are working in dangerously low levels of oxygen supply which can lead to adverse patient incident. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)

The Delhi High Court Wednesday said the responsibility to supply medical oxygen to all the hospitals falls squarely on the shoulders of the Centre and directed it to supply the oxygen by “whatever means”.

The division bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked the Centre to protect the fundamental right of citizens who are seriously ill due to Covid-19 and require medical oxygen. If necessary, the court said, the Centre should divert the entire production of oxygen from industries, particularly steel and petroleum industries.

“The demand for oxygen run by Max as well as all other hospitals dealing with Covid-19 patients has gone up manifolds. The supply of oxygen from the established sources is not able to meet the said demand,” said the court.

The court’s directive comes as the Delhi government, which had until Tuesday been accusing Uttar Pradesh of curbing supply of oxygen to the capital, was on Wednesday accused by Haryana of stealing oxygen from a tanker.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the management of Max Healthcare for supply of oxygen to its hospitals in Delhi. The petitioner told the court that most of the hospitals in the network are working in dangerously low levels of oxygen supply which can lead to adverse patient incident.

The court also said the central government should consider ways and means of transporting the oxygen from production plants either by creating a dedicated corridor so that the supply lines are not obstructed or even by airlifting the same from the place of production to the place of delivery.

On the central government’s submission that oxygen supply to Delhi has been increased from 378 MTs to 480 MTs, the court said, “What is the point of all this paper exercise. We do not understand. If they require 700 MTs… the number of patients has risen… It is no solace to anybody you are supplying 400 odd. We are not blaming you but you have to understand that it is an emergency. The point is the central government has all the power and resources at its command.”","As of Tuesday, over 40,000 patients were under observation at home as compared to nearly 24,500 on November 11 last year, when the previous coronavirus wave hit a peak in the capital.

An increase in the number of Covid patients under home isolation has stretched district health and medical teams thin, particularly at a time when several healthcare workers are also ill.

Officials managing home isolation in south, east, central and north districts said they are trying to augment their manpower as the number of patients is significantly higher than the previous Covid surge in November.

As of Tuesday, over 40,000 patients were under observation at home as compared to nearly 24,500 on November 11 last year, when the previous coronavirus wave hit a peak in the capital.

In east and north districts, help has been sought from civil defence volunteers to provide oximeters and medical kits to households that have been affected.

In south and central districts, officials said resident welfare associations are helping prepare a list of doctors who can volunteer to provide tele-consultation support.

A medical official in the central district said, “We are seeing many patients in panic right now because they are hearing about the crisis in our hospitals, the lack of oxygen and the number of deaths. Before the recent surge in cases, we faced trouble getting patients to hospitals because they were not willing to go and we used to seek help from the police to shift them. Now, most patients are thinking that they have a better chance of recovery in a hospital.”

District health teams provide medical kits to Covid-19 patients in home isolation through Asha workers or nurses and midwives. The patients are also supposed to receive a call every day to check about their health. Officials in district health teams state that their staff numbers have more or less remained the same for about a year and half as the Covid-19 infections fluctuated.

This time, however, many field workers have either tested positive themselves or have family members who are down with the virus, as per officials. “Some staff have their relatives on ventilator support in hospitals but are on the phone with patients every day, asking them not to panic and stay strong… The physical and emotional toll is immense,” said a central district health official.

A health official from the north district said they are sometimes not able to reach all patients on the same day for providing medical kits due to shortage of manpower. “In urban areas of Delhi, the population density is high and there are about 3-4 Asha workers at most to cater to a particular division in the district… because of the rise in cases, we are sometimes not able to reach everyone on the same day, and also the next day about 100-plus patients are again added to the home isolation list. That causes a build up of pending work, but we are getting some relief with help of civil defence volunteers,” the official said.

Most phone calls made to helplines in east and south districts are about patients requesting hospital beds. Officials said they coordinate with hospitals and Covid care centres (CCC) about availability of beds before sending patients whose oxygen levels have dipped below a certain limit.

“However, many patients are directly going to the hospital without consulting their district health and medical officials first, the reason behind which may be many — they are either unaware of the system or could not get in touch with us. We investigate each case before recommending hospitalisation, but because many patients are choosing to directly go to the hospitals without consulting us, they face difficulty in finding beds,” said a north district official.","Gurgaon has recorded its highest-ever single-day spike in Covid cases, with 2,988 people testing positive Wednesday. The number of active cases of the infection has now crossed 16,000.

Prior to this, the district’s highest count of Covid cases in a single day had been recorded on Saturday, when 2,549 new cases were reported. This is the third day since then when more than 2,000 people have tested positive for the infection in the district – 2,401 new cases had emerged on Sunday, and 2,344 cases on Tuesday.

According to the daily bulletin issued by the district health department, Gurgaon now has 16,027 active Covid cases, of which 15,010 are in home isolation.

The district also recorded four more fatalities due to the infection today, bringing the total count of fatalities this week to 13 already – five fatalities were recorded on Monday and four on Tuesday. A total of 391 people have succumbed to the infection in Gurgaon since the pandemic first broke out last year, of whom 303 had comorbidities while the remaining 88 had no comorbidities.

With the surge in cases, there has been an acute shortage of beds for Covid patients in the district for the last few days. As of 6 pm this evening, there were nine vacant ICU beds and five vacant ventilator beds in the district. Officials, however, have assured that facilities in the district are being ramped up.

“We are making every effort to increase the number of beds in Gurgaon district, and we hope to add around 600 beds in the next three or four days,” said Deputy Commissioner Yash Garg on Wednesday.","There are almost 400 police personnel infected with Covid at the moment, out of which 15 officers are admitted to hospitals.

Four out of 15 Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) in the national capital have tested positive for Covid in the last one week and are under home quarantine. There are almost 400 police personnel infected with Covid at the moment, out of which 15 officers are admitted to hospitals.

A senior police officer said Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava held a meeting with senior officers on the Covid strategy and raised concerns on the rising cases among the force. “He also asked all senior officials to be more careful as they have to lead their teams during this crisis,” the officer said.

“DCP (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram and additional DCP (Shahdara) Amrutha Gugultoth had tested positive earlier. Then JCP (New Delhi range) Jaspal Singh tested positive and was admitted to a hospital in South Delhi. Later, DCP (West) Urvija Goel and her husband, DCP Parvinder Singh, also tested positive. Now DCP (East) Deepak Yadav has tested positive and his subordinates have been asked to go for isolation,” a senior police officer said.

Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said that while taking a review meeting with district DCPs, ACPs and SHOs on the first day of the week-long lockdown, the police chief emphasised on the health and safety of police personnel posted on the ground round the clock. “He directed the deployment at pickets and areas to be in small groups and with social distancing while checking people or vehicles so that their exposure risk is less. The district and unit officers were told to keep sufficient stock of Covid equipment like PPE kits, masks, sanitisers, etc and pay attention to repeated cleanliness of toilets and common areas of the barracks and police stations,” he said.

Senior officers are planning to get everyone vaccinated soon to ensure safety of their staff, many of whom work more than 12 hours a day at Covid hospitals and testing and isolation centres. Biswal had earlier said, “The first dose of the vaccine has been administered to 72,677 personnel. Out of the total 80,000 police personnel registered for vaccination drive, more than 90% have taken the first dose. The second dose has also been administered to 56,113 personnel. We want everyone to get vaccinated soon since a majority of the force is deployed to curb violations in the city and ensure curfew.”","Amid a week-long lockdown to contain surging Covid-19 cases, the Rohini district police has appointed 10 police officers in their district to provide food to migrants after receiving an emergency call. This is the first district in Delhi that has launched a helpline for migrants. The 10 police stations, designated to execute the plan, under the Rohini district jurisdiction are South Rohini, North Rohini, Prashant Vihar, K N Katju Marg, Begumpur, Aman Vihar, Prem Nagar, Vijay Vihar, Budh Vihar, and Kanjhawala.

An order, issued on April 20, by Additional DCP (Rohini) Jitendra Kumar Meena stated, “In view of the outbreak of the covid-19 in Delhi, the 10 police officers from their respective police stations will perform the duty as a Nodal Officers in connection with PCR calls of Corona and hunger/migrant. They will supervise the PCR calls personally and respond immediately. They will also maintain the record regarding these PCR calls.”

DCP (Rohini district) Pranav Tayal told The Indian Express that they are already providing food to migrants and have now just set up a proper framework. “We have coordinated with several NGOs, those are running kitchens in the district to provide food to the migrants. We are also creating a group of good samaritans in our area, who are willing to help and also providing medical help to all the locals,” he said.

After receiving several PCR calls in their respective areas, the Rohini district police helped locals to get bed in the concerned hospital and also assisted them to get essential drugs necessary for the treatment of COVID-19 patients after coordinating with concerned agencies.","These Covid care centres have been set up for Delhi police personnel and for their family members to get immediate relief till the time they get admission in regular covid hospitals.

To provide immediate medical facility for corona patients, Delhi Police has constructed a fully functional covid care centre in the newly built quarters in Shahdara police station complex with 78 beds of which 20 are with oxygen support. Two more care centres have also been set up at Rohini and Dwarka police training school. Rohini facility has 20 beds of which 10 are oxygen beds and Dwarka PTS facility will be the next to go operational.

Delhi Police Spokesperson, Chinmoy Biswal said they have decided to open care centres in view of the freshly rising incidents of covid infection among Delhi Police personnel, who are frontline warriors in the battle against coronavirus.

“The doctors are being provided by GTB hospital and nurses and paramedic staff are being provided by Hamdard Foundation. Oxygen cylinders are being provided by Seva Bharati, while facility and medicines will be provided from Delhi Police resources, including a dedicated ambulance, which will be stationed there, to attend to emergencies.

Police said the oxygen cylinders were to reach Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini this morning but the truck wasn’t able to cross the border.

DCP (Outernorth) Rajiv Ranjan said they received information from the District Magistrate (DM) Northwest at around 9 am on Wednesday about the truck.

“There was a lack of oxygen cylinders at the hospital. Station House Officer at Alipur along with other staffers rushed to the KMP flyover. The truck was found loaded with cylinders. With the help of Haryana police and traffic officials, the team cleared a passage,” said the DCP.

Police staff on bikes and vans escorted the truck to the hospital within 30 minutes of the distress call.

Meanwhile, the Kisan Ekta Morcha released a statement about the incident saying, “Farmers have kept open a way to emergency services since the first day. Not a single ambulance or essential goods service has been stopped. It is the government that has put strong and multilayers barricades (nails), not the farmers… false propaganda is being spread against farmers that they have blocked the roads and not letting oxygen into Delhi. This is completely false news. Yes, we are protesting but not against the covid patients, warriors or common citizens, we are against the government’s discriminatory policy on agriculture.”","The order states that a committee of officers is to be constituted to ensure the welfare of daily wagers and migrant workers.

The Delhi government has announced Rs 5,000 relief for registered construction workers in the national capital. The relief is part of a slew of steps that will be taken to help migrant workers and daily wagers, many of whom are leaving the city fearing loss of livelihood, after the government announced a six-day lockdown to arrest the spread of Covid cases in Delhi.

There are a total of 1,71,861 registered workers but registration will be kept open and newly registered workers will be covered too, stated the order.

Food, shelter and other necessities

The order states that a committee of officers is to be constituted to ensure the welfare of daily wagers and migrant workers. The committee is tasked with ensuring that food, water, shelter, clothing and medication are made available to workers. Those workers at construction sites are to be provided with food, shelter and other medications, too.

“For the purpose of providing food, the contractors providing mid-day meals to school children in government and MCD schools, should be utilised,” stated the order.

The funds from Delhi Building and other Construction Workers Welfare Board (DBCWWB) will be utilised for the same. It further stated, “Finance Department, GNCTD shall arrange adequate funds, if required, in addition to the funds available with the Delhi Building And Other Construction Workers Welfare Board for ensuring Overall welfare of and for providing the aforesaid basic amenities and other necessities to the migrant workers, daily wagers, construction workers in compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court.”

A second order throws light on how these steps will be implemented. The Board is to share a consolidated list of construction sites and workers with the Divisional Commissioner, Revenue Department. The education department has allocated 39 mid-day-meal suppliers in 11 districts. Further, the health department will link construction sites with dispensaries. Manpower will be deployed at construction sites by the district authorities.

Helpline

A 24×7 helpline number will be set up by the board and will function as a grievance redressal cell. The helpline number will be messaged to all registered construction workers on their registered mobile numbers. Appropriate action will be taken by the board based on the complaint.

“For instance if the DBOCWW receives a distress call in respect of non-provision of ration/food supplies, the same shall be communicated to the concerned area SDMs/officers of Revenue Department for further prompt action,” reads the order.","16:00 (IST) Apr 21

Some top hospitals have less than 5hrs of oxygen left

Health minister Satyendar Jain tweeted at 10.19pm on Tuesday tagging Union minister Piyush Goyal: âAcute shortage of oxygen at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital . Oxygen may not last beyond four hours. More than 500 corona patients on oxygen. Please help, Piyush Goyal, to restore the oxygen supply to avert major crisis (sic).â

Among the top private hospitals in the city, Venkateshwar had only four hours of oxygen stock left and Maharaja Agrasen five hours. BLK, Batra, Stephenâs, Ganga Ram, Holy Family, Max Patparganj, Balaji and Shree Agrasen had 8-10 hours, 8-9 hours,12-15 hours,16-18 hours, 24 hours, 8-10 hours, 48 hours and 48 hours, respectively, of oxygen stock left.

âWe require 9,000-10,000 cubic metres of oxygen every day in this hospital. We have more than 500 Covid-19 beds. We are getting assurances from both the Centre and the state government on oxygen supply,â said Dr D S Rana, Chairman, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.

Even smaller hospitals are facing a serious crisis. âI have more than 20 Covid-19 patients admitted in the hospital. We have limited supply of oxygen available at present. I have been calling everyone to arrange for more so that the admitted patients do not die without the critical support,â said Dr Vinay Aggarwal of Pushpanjali Medical Centre in east Delhi.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 management, tweeted: âSOS phones are coming from all hospitals regarding oxygen. People supplying oxygen are being stopped in different states. There should be no jungle raj between the states on the supply of oxygen. For this, the central government will have to be very sensitive and alert.â

Delhi government is procuring oxygen cylinders from Noida and Rajasthan but the supplies are being stopped in various states, alleged several government officials.

The officials added that state authorities were in talks with the central government and had requested for a smooth and timely supply.

The beat cops took it upon themselves to get all garbage, scrapped vehicles and heaps of building material removed to beautify the area. Before the clean-up, the area was inhabited by anti-social elements who hid there at night or consumed drugs, forcing residents to avoid it after the sunset.

A constable is now posted in the area, which is now patrolled regularly to ensure that it is not encroached upon again. The high court said the cops had shown commendable creativity in bringing about a change.

The initiative was taken after constables Hem Raj and Rahul, along with head constable Amar Singh, came up with the idea. Inspector Anil Sharma, SHO of Rajouri Garden, along with civic agencies, took it upon himself to complete the project.

The land was to be cleared by the civic bodies after a high court order, but it had not happened. The cops, along with residents, cleared up the ground. Recently a badminton and sports competition was also organised for girls.

âIt was not just about making it a playground but we also wanted to clear the garbage since the slums were just next to it and the dump could pose a serious health hazard,â said an officer. âEarlier the area was used by the anti-social elements who would sit here and people would fear stepping out.â

To make the area secure, police have also shut two entries to the slum clusters and installed CCTV cameras, said an officer.

","NEW DELHI: Delhi Police continued to don the hat of life saviour by supplying oxygen to nearly 400 Covid patients since Monday night after their hospitals faced a supply crisis.On Monday night, in Outer Delhiâs Paschim Vihar, the cops provided a green corridor to facilitate movement of two oxygen tankers to Balaji Action Hospital after its stock reached critical levels. At risk were 235 Covid patients and the tankers were stuck on the Delhi borders amid Covid restrictions.Around 11.30pm, they got the information that the tankers carrying 19,500 litre liquid oxygen were stuck at a border point in a traffic jam. âA dedicated corridor was provided by the outer district police and the tankers were escorted by Delhi Police vehicles to the hopsital,â said additional deputy commissioner of police (outer) Sudhanshu Dhama.The cops arranged another 25 oxygen cylinders through cooperation of the medical superintendents of Sanjay Gandhi, Bhagwan Mahavir, Maharaja Agrasen and Jaipur Golden hospitals for Balaji Action Hospital, he said.Delhi Police officials also managed to arrange oxygen cylinders for a hospital in Nangloi when its supplies started running out. The director of Mansaram Hospital, Ravinder Dabas, said they had 33 Covid-positive patients. âI was trying at multiple places but nothing was available. Delhi Police arranged the oxygen cylinders in an hour,â Dabas said.In north Delhi, it was a race against time for the cops after they received an SOS call from NKS Super Specialty Hospital around 4.37pm on Tuesday. Out of its 130 patients, 102 were suffering from Covid and the hospital ran out of oxygen. âThe hospital authorities had tried to overcome the shortage, but cylinders were not available,â the DCP said.As agitated relatives of the patients started gathering at the hospital, a senior official assured them that all efforts would be made to replenish the supply at the earliest. The cops reached a dealer in Mayapuri where 53 cylinders were sent by the NKS hospital for refilling around 5pm. On reaching there at 5.37pm, the cops got the cyliners filled up and were back in the hospital around 6.08pm through a green corridor. In the meantime, they also arranged 15 cylinders from Moti Nagar.","New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party has alleged that municipal corporations are not clearing the garbage from the households having Covid-19 patients under home isolation.

During a health emergency, corporations should streamline garbage clearance and stay away from doing dirty politics, Pathak said.Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it was sad that Pathak was playing the blame game during the pandemic. âAll three corporations are, for the past one year, regularly working to collect biogarbage from homes of all Covid patients under isolation. Last week, the corporations had even issued centralised helpline numbers for people to call Covid garbage collection service. The blame game is an insult to the hard-working sanitary workers who are risking their own safety moving from home to home of Covid patients to collect garbage,â he added.","New Delhi: Some parts of Delhi witnessed drizzling on Tuesday under the influence of a western disturbance.

","New Delhi: A man lodged in jail allegedly for rioting during the northeast Delhi violence has been granted bail by a city court, which observed that police had arrested him a year after lodging of the FIR .

The court also noted that two other accused with similar alleged roles had been let off on bail earlier. âHis arrest has been effected after about a year of the incident in question,â said additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav.

âNo recovery of any sort has been effected from him. Investigation in the matter is complete and chargesheet filed; even the copy(ies) of supplementary chargesheet stood supplied to the applicant; and as such, no useful purpose will be served by keeping him behind bars, as trial in the matter is likely to take a long time,â the order added.

Advocate Salim Malik, appearing for the accused, Khalid, said the latter was arrested on January 6, 2021â one year from the date of the FIR â merely on disclosures made by the co-accused and an alleged viral video, where he was âseen pelting stonesâ. Malik argued that Khalid had been in judicial custody since. âThe CCTV footage relied upon by the investigating agency is not related to the alleged incident,â he claimed.

Special public prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma, however, submitted that Khalid had been clearly spotted pelting stones on police and carrying a stick. âHe could not be arrested earlier as he was not traceable. He was traced after efforts put in by the investigating agency with the help of the viral video,â he submitted.

The court held that the prosecution was unable to distinguish Khalidâs alleged role of stone pelting from that of the co-accused. âIt is further a matter of record that, based on somewhat similar material, another co-accused, Abdul Sattar, was granted bail by the court of the principal district and sessions judge (northeast) on January 11, 2021,â the order stated.

A full bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi, Rekha Palli and Talwant Singh said that since the high court has restricted itself as well as the district courts to hear urgent matters only and in view of the curfew imposed in Delhi from the night of April 19, lawyers and litigants will not be able to appear in their matters in which interim orders have been passed.

âAs a result, interim orders operating in favour of the parties will start expiring on and from April 19,â the court said and directed that all such orders shall stand extended till July 16. In it order on Tuesday, the bench made it clear that the interim orders are being extended till July 16 or further orders except where the Supreme Court may have passed any contrary orders in any such matter during this period.

","New Delhi: Though domestic workers havenât been exempted from the weeklong lockdown in the city, many residentsâ welfare associations ( RWAs ) on Tuesday found it difficult to keep them out as many people called them to work. At places, residents even had arguments with security guards for stopping domestic workers from entering the complex.âDespite orders, we had several people, including domestic and construction workers, gathering outside the entry gate on Tuesday morning. Our guards informed the residents that individual movement of people was prohibited, but in vain. We also saw people calling labourers for construction work, which was surprising.

NEW DELHI: Over 20,000 guest teachers working in different Delhi government schools have been left high and dry yet again. In an order, the Directorate of Education (DoE) has asked schools to suspend the services of guest teachers from April 20 till the summer vacation ends .

On Monday, Delhi government had announced that in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, the summer vacation would now begin from April 20 and end on June 9.

The DoE order stated, âAll heads of schools are hereby directed to discontinue the services of all guest teachers engaged in their school wef from April 20. However, during the vacation period, heads of schools are hereby authorised to call guest teachers as per requirement for any school-related work while maintaining Covid-appropriate behavior and following the standard operating procedure. The guest teachers who shall be called during the summer vacation will be paid as per norms.â

Last year too, guest teachers had faced a similar situation during the lockdown. Many of them had to resort to selling vegetables and working in a tyre shop to eke out a living.

All India Guest Teachersâ Association member Shoaib Rana said, âAs the summer vacation has been advanced, we are likely to lose out on our salaries. With Covid cases surging, we will not be able to do other jobs as well. In a bid to save some money, the government is not realising that there are several families that are dependent on the earnings of the guest teachers.â

Guest teachers working in Delhi government schools on average get paid over Rs 30,000 per month. They get paid on the basis of the number of days they have worked.

Another guest teacher said, âBefore Covid, there used to be camps and remedial classes during summers where we used to get work. Now, when permanent teachers are also there, why would any school head call the guest teachers? At this time of crisis, the government should not have taken this decision.â

All India Parentsâ Association has also appealed to the government to reconsider the decision. âThe state has to work for the welfare of the people, but Delhi government has instead put the guest teachers in a precarious situation,â said Ashok Agarwal, president of AIPA.

Government officials did not respond to TOIâs queries in this regard.

Interspecies chimera

Published in Cell

Scientists have now grown monkey embryos containing human stem cells for the first time, raising several ethical questions. Fertilised eggs extracted from monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were injected with human extended pluripotent stem cells. Out of the injected 132 embryos, three survived 19 days after fertilisation. Scientists hope that such hybrids could be used as models for drug tests and to grow organs for transplants. Expressing concern, Julian Savulescu and Julian Koplin from the University of Melbourne wrote in a statement, “The challenge for chimera research is that there is no agreed-upon account of moral status. We need to work out what properties confer a right to life, a right to not be experimented on without consent and a right to live freely.”

DNA in sediments

Skeletal remains and DNA collected from them have helped archeologists tell stories of our long-lost relatives. But what to do when such bones and teeth are not available? Study the sediments, says a new paper that extracted nuclear DNA from cave sediments and showed that the Neanderthal population lived in the region 100,000 years ago.

Researchers studying pot fragments from 12 archaeological sites in Central Nigeria were in for a sweet surprise when they found that it contained beeswax. It implied that the Nok people who lived in the region about 3,500 years ago consumed honey and also heated the wax to be used as a coating for the cooking pots or to store honey.

Inspired by the porous and layered cuttlefish bone, researchers have 3D printed new microstructures and materials that show many adaptations. The team hopes that this can help 3-D print implants for injuries. ""The implants would more closely mimic the porous nature of the human bone and would promote the growth of the bone itself inside the scaffold. As the bone grows, the scaffold biodegrades, and if everything goes well, in the end, the scaffold is gone, and the patient has new bones in the right places."" explains the corresponding author of the work A. Pereira in a release.

It's all in the gut

Published in Cell Reports

There is a connection between sugar, mosquitoes and malaria. A new study has shown that when mosquitoes are given a sugar diet, it increases the abundance of a particular bacteria in the mosquito's gut. This in turn raises the gut’s pH and leads to an increase in the number of malaria-causing parasites in its midgut. The team writes that this finding may help in the development of new preventive strategies.","This will be SpaceX’s third crew flight for NASA from Florida's Kennedy Space Center in under a year.

For the first time, NASA is putting its trust in a recycled SpaceX rocket and capsule for a crew.

Astronaut Megan McArthur takes special pleasure in the reused spacecraft set to soar Thursday morning. In “a fun twist,” she’ll sit in the same seat in the same capsule as her husband, Bob Behnken, did last spring for a test flight to the International Space Station. “It's kind of a fun thing that we can share. I can see him and say, ‘Hey, can you hand over the keys. I'm ready now to go,' “ she said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. She and her three crewmates will spend six months at the space station.

This will be SpaceX’s third crew flight for NASA from Florida's Kennedy Space Center in under a year. The commercial flights ended the U.S.'s reliance on Russian rockets launched from Kazakhstan to get astronauts to and from the space station after the shuttles retired.

SpaceX’s Benji Reed noted Tuesday the private company already has put six people in space — as many as NASA's Project Mercury did back in the early 1960s when it launched the first Americans. The upcoming flight will boost that number to 10.

Some highlights of the SpaceX flight:

Use, recycle, repeat: Both the Dragon capsule and Falcon rocket for this mission have soared once before. The capsule launched the first SpaceX crew last May, while the rocket hoisted the second set of astronauts, who are still at the space station.

This handout photo released by NASA shows a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company's Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard at sunset on the launch pad at Launch Complex 39A as preparations continue for the Crew-2 mission, April 19, 2021, at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. | Photo Credit: AFP

For SpaceX, recycling is key to space exploration, Reed said, lowering costs, increasing flights and destinations, and allowing more kinds of people to jump on board. Each capsule is designed to launch at least five times with a crew.

SpaceX and NASA are assessing how many times a Falcon can safely launch astronauts. For satellites, Falcons can be used for 10 flights. The company uses the same kind of rocket and similar capsules for station supply runs, and recycles those, too.

U.S.-French-Japanese Crew: This is the most internationally diverse crew yet for SpaceX. NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, a retired Army colonel, is the spacecraft commander, with McArthur, an oceanographer, as his pilot. Thomas Pesquet, a former Air France pilot, is representing the European Space Agency. Engineer Akihiko Hoshide has worked for the Japanese Space Agency for nearly 30 years and helped build the space station.

All but McArthur have already visited the 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) outpost. But she's ventured 100 miles (160 kilometers) higher on the space shuttle, taking part in NASA's final Hubble Space Telescope mission in 2009. The four have started a new recycled-rocket tradition for SpaceX crews, writing their initials in the soot of their booster.

Bon appetit: With French and Japanese astronauts flying together, dining promises to reach new heights. Hoshide is taking up curry and rice, as well as canned fish and yakitori — grilled and skewered chicken — but no sushi.

Pesquet had a Michelin-starred chef whip up some French delicacies: beef with red wine and mushroom sauce, truffled potato and onion tart, and almond tart with caramelized pears. There are also Crepes Suzette.

Pesquet said last weekend he had “some national pressure” to fly French cuisine. His crewmates also had high expectations: “OK, we're flying with a Frenchman, it better be good.""

Coming and going: Five days after this crew's arrival at the space station, the one Japanese and three U.S. astronauts who have been up there since November will strap into their SpaceX capsule to come home.

NASA wants some time in orbit between the two crews, so the newcomers can benefit from their colleagues' experience up there.

SpaceX is targeting an April 28 splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Tallahassee, Florida. The company already is conferring with the Coast Guard to prevent pleasure boats from swarming the area like they did for the first SpaceX crew's splashdown in August. More Coast Guard ships will be on patrol this time."


"The Minister had earlier asked the State governments to take strict action against anyone found indulged in black marketing or hoarding of Remdesivir.

The government’s decision to waive off customs duty on antiviral drug Remdesivir would help in augmenting the supply of the medicine in the wake of soaring COVID-19 cases in the country, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Sadananda Gowda said on Wednesday.

The government on Tuesday waived off all customs duty on imported Remdesivir injections and the drug’s active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in order to boost supplies.

There is already a ban on the export of the Remdesivir injection from the country. “Considering the immediate requirement on the recommendation of the Department of Pharmaceuticals, the Department of Revenue has reduced customs duty on #Remdesivir and its API/KSM. This step will further augment domestic availability of Remdesivir injection,” Mr. Gowda said in a tweet.

The Minister had earlier asked the State governments to take strict action against anyone found indulged in black marketing or hoarding of Remdesivir.

Black marketing, hoarding of Remdesivir is being strictly monitored and State governments have been advised to take strict action against those indulging in such malpractices, he had tweeted.

On Sunday, Minister of State of Chemicals and Fertilizers Mansukh L Mandaviya had tweeted that the government plans to double the production of Remdesivir to around three lakh vials per day over the next 15 days, to make it available readily for the treatment of COVID-19.

The government has given permission to 20 plants to produce the antiviral drug, he had said. Already, Remdesivir is being rolled out of 20 plants in the country.

On Saturday, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) had announced that the pharmaceutical companies such as Cadila Healthcare, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and Cipla have reduced the price of their respective brands of Remdesivir injection (100mg/vial).

Nearly three lakh new COVID-19 cases and over 2,000 deaths were reported in the country on Wednesday, a record-high since the pandemic broke out last year.

As per the Union Health Ministry, as many as 2,95,041 new COVID-19 cases and 2,023 deaths were reported, taking the total cases to 1,56,16,130, including 21,57,538 active cases.","The Nifty and the Sensex are closed today on account of Ram Navami.

U.S. currency watchlist an intrusion: official

Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan on Tuesday questioned the rationale behind the U.S. government’s decision to put India in the watchlist for currency manipulators, and said the list constituted an intrusion into the policy space needed by central banks around the world to meet their mandates.

The U.S. Treasury Department had recently retained India in a watchlist for currency manipulators submitted to the U.S. Congress, citing higher dollar purchases (close to 5% of the gross domestic product) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Another trigger for the inclusion in the currency watchlist is a trade surplus of $20 billion or more. India’s trade surplus with the U.S. grew by about $5 billion to $23 billion in 2020-21 from around $18 billion in the previous fiscal year as imports fell more sharply than exports in the COVID-affected year.

Oil falls for second day as India's COVID-19 surge to dent fuel demand

Dent in demand for oil as lockdowns loom.

Reuters reports: ""Oil prices fell for a second day on Wednesday on concerns that soaring COVID-19 cases in India will drive down fuel demand in the world's third biggest oil importer.

Brent crude futures for June fell 52 cents, or 0.8%, to $66.05 a barrel at 0157 GMT, after dropping 48 cents on Tuesday.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for June fell 56 cents, or 0.9%, to $62.11 a barrel. The May contract expired on Tuesday down 1.5% at $62.44.

""You've seen refiners there (in India) scale back runs because demand has fallen with the spread of lockdowns. That's clearly weighing on the market and sentiment,"" said Lachlan Shaw, head of commodity research at National Australia Bank .

India, also the world's third-largest oil user, on Tuesday reported its worst daily death toll from COVID-19 and is facing an oxygen supply crisis to treat patients. Large parts of the country are now under lockdown due to a huge second wave of the pandemic.

Further weighing on the market, data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group showed U.S. crude oil and distillate stocks rose in the week ended April 16, according to two market sources, compared with analysts' forecasts for declines in crude and distillate inventories.

Crude stocks rose by 436,000 barrels, API reported, according to the sources. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a 3 million bbl drawdown in crude stocks.

Distillate stocks, which include diesel, heating oil and jet fuel, rose by 655,000 barrels, compared with analysts' forecasts for a 1 million barrel decline.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration will release its inventory data for last week later on Wednesday.

Analysts said despite the pandemic hotspots in places like India and growing concerns in Japan, the world's fourth-biggest oil user, signs are still positive for a fuel demand recovery in the United States, UK and Europe.

""Driving is soaring in the UK as the vaccine rollout accelerates. Such is also the case in the US, where drivers consume over 10% of the world's oil,"" ANZ analysts said in a note.""

Citibank tells Indian retail customers it's ‘business as usual’

Citigroup’s franchise in the country, which includes Citibank India and its consumer banking business and credit cards division, continues to operate as usual, a company official said.

The official, who was providing a clarification on the impact to customer operations as a result of Citigroup’s recent announcement that it planned to exit the retail banking business in 13 markets including India, referred to a recent statement by Citibank India. The official also added that customers of the consumer bank would be able to avail of their usual services till a buyer or buyers were found for the business, after due approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

“There is no immediate change to our operations and no immediate impact to our colleagues as a result of this announcement,” Citibank India CEO Ashu Khullar said in the statement. “In the interim, we will continue to serve our clients with the same care, empathy and dedication that we do today,” he asserted.","The report has also called for speeding up the vaccination drive that of late has been on the decline on a weekly basis.

With the pandemic caseload remaining over 2.5 lakh for the second day, a report has warned of the grim economic scenario as with even limited restrictions on people's movement and some businesses, power consumption and e-way GST bill collections are already down.

The report has also called for speeding up the vaccination drive that of late has been on the decline on a weekly basis.

With cases spreading very fast, more and more states are clamping down more localised restrictions on people movement and commerce, falling just short of a complete lockdown. This already has electricity consumption and GST e-way bills collection, which are used as proxies to track economic activity, softening somewhat and it needs to be seen whether this softening is a blip, or marks a shift in a trend, Crisil said in a note on Tuesday.

What proves to be a saving grace is that manufacturing and construction activities are operating, and travel and recreation services are also allowed in most states with social distancing measures.

But a greater concern is the stuttering pace of vaccinations as the number of people vaccinated per million daily was lower at 2,408 for the week to April 18 compared to 2,554 in the week to April 11.

As a result as of April 18, only 16.4 % of population in 45-65 age-group is vaccinated, and those in the 65 and above age bracket, as much as 33.1 % are inoculated, said the report.

The impact of these restrictions, though, is beginning to affect retail mobility, which dipped across more states, with the highest drop in Maharashtra at 17.7 percentage points decline between March and April 18 on average.

The second wave of the pandemic continues to spread fast, crossing the grim benchmark of 2 lakh daily infections in the week of April 12-18 giving the country the unenviable distinction of having the highest number of daily cases in the world, surpassing Brazil.

Maharashtra, which for long has been the fountainhead in terms of coronavirus cases, has of late seen a steep fall in new caseloads. While UP, MP and Delhi have seen significant increase in the week to April 18. Maharashtra's share has come down to 28.2 % in the week to April 18 from 42.3 % in the week to April 11.","A man checks his mobile phones in front of State Bank of India (SBI) branch in Kolkata, India, February 9, 2018.

According to data available with markets regulator Sebi, companies listed on BSE and NSE garnered a total of Rs 7.72 lakh crore through issuance of bonds in the just concluded financial year, much higher than Rs 6.75 lakh crore raised in 2019-20.

In 2018-19, listed entities raised Rs 6.1 lakh crore, Rs 5.99 lakh crore in 2017-18 and Rs 6.4 lakh crore in 2016-17.

However, debt raised through such a route stood as low as Rs 1.18 lakh crore in 2007-08. Data prior to this was not available with Sebi.

The funds were mopped up to strengthen balance sheets, retire existing debt and to support working capital requirements.

Harsh Jain Co-founder and COO Groww said that one reason behind companies choosing this route is that the interest cost on bond issuance is relatively low.

In addition, banks and NBFCs have also been hesitant to issue large loans to corporates on account of rising NPAs (non-performing assets), he added.

“Considering low interest rates, and high appetite from institutional investors and capital expansion plans of many companies, there is an additional interest in raising money from issuance of private placement of bonds,” Divam Sharma, co-founder of Green Portfolio, said.

Reliance Securities’ Modi said that a persistent low interest rate cycle and surplus liquidity in the system aided growth in bond issuance through private placements.

Additionally, the introduction of a special liquidity window by the RBI for select sectors during the year also supported growth, he added.

According to Kaushlendra Singh Sengar, founder of Invest19 Technologies, companies raised funds via private placement due to its structural advantage to meet the needs of entrepreneurs and investors. It is a cost and time-effective method of raising funds.

Above all, it does not require detailed compliance of formalities as required with a public issue, he added.

In terms of numbers, 1,995 issuances took place in the period under review, as compared to 1,787 in 2019-20.

In private placements, firms issue securities or bonds to institutional investors.

Green Portfolio’s Sharma said that many banks have raised money through private placement of Basel-III compliant bonds as there is an increasing appetite from some domestic financial institutions including LIC to participate in such offerings.

Invest19 Technologies’ Sengar believes that fund raising through the route is most likely to see a surge in private placements of bonds in the ongoing fiscal as the economy is suffering from the COVID-19 crisis.

As the country is battling the resurging of COVID cases, so going forward, the central bank may reduce the interest rate to maintain sufficient liquidity in the economy. With the low interest rates and regulatory advantage, the companies can garner more funds on a private placement basis, he added.

The trend of higher fund raising through debt raised on the private placement basis should continue in FY22 considering high liquidity, high appetite of institutional investors and upcoming capex plans from many corporates, Sharma said.

However, Reliance Securities’ Modi is of the view that cost of funds is unlikely to remain as low as witnessed in the last two years and therefore any noticeable growth in fund raising through debt private placement does not look to be on the cards in FY22.","Hero Moto and Gogoro will set up a battery swapping grid in India now which will be used by their potential cu...

NEW DELHI: Hero Moto will be setting up a large network of electric battery-swapping stations across the country in a joint venture with Taiwanese unicorn Gogoro as the countryâs largest two-wheeler company prepares to launch its first green vehicle by the end of the year.

âWe will be launching our first electric vehicle later this fiscal. Hero Moto intends to build electric products, and these will be powered by the network that we develop with Gogoro,â Hero chairman Pawan Munjal told TOI as the company looks at a transition towards green wheels.

Heroâs rivals such as Bajaj Auto and TVS have already launched electric two-wheelers in the market, though concerns around a robust charging network and high retail price has meant a slow adoption.

Munjal said that Hero is working on a variety of technologies to build its electric vehicles , apart from looking at different models to make them affordable. These include making battery cost optional for customers by leasing them out and charging on usage through a subscription model.

âWe intend to give different options to customers, which could include a vehicle where we charge for the battery or one where we give it out on lease. We are also learning from Gogoroâs experience in Taiwan,â Munjal said in the presence of Gogoro founder Horace Luke.

A swapping model (leased or self-owned) would mean near-instant recharge time for customers of electric vehicles.

For example, instead of looking at spending time on charging a battery, a customer would simply walk into a swapping station, take out his vehicleâs drained-out battery and replace it with a fully charged one. All s/he may have to pay is a subscription fee for the service and the payment for the electric charge.

Gogoro, founded in 2011 , has created a grid of battery swap stations in Taiwan and boasts of having more than 3.75 lakh riders and 2,000 stations on its network. It manages nearly 2.6 lakh battery swaps daily with more than 174 million battery swaps to date. It also sells electric two-wheelers.

Hero Moto and Gogoro will set up a battery swapping grid in India now which will be used by their potential customers.

Munjal said they also intend to have franchise partners and the JV can also looking at opening the charging network to rival two-wheeler brands if they have similar batteries.

Hero is working on a slew of technologies for its EV foray and the research is being carried out at its Centre of Innovation and Technology (CIT) in Jaipur and also the tech centre in Germany. It also has financial investments in Indian EV start-up Ather.

","NEW DELHI: Human beings need #HOPE to architect a better future in a post-Covid world. Social impact strategist Kunal Sood âs goal is to reimagine #HOPE in todayâs divisive world, ensuring that the best minds from the best companies Help Our Planet Everyday to create a better future.

His vision for Operation #HOPE at #WeThePlanet on Earth Day is to elevate humanity ushering in a new era of human prosperity and planetary flourishing by inspiring a new generation of extraordinary citizenship and regenerative urban design.

As an entrepreneur and impact strategist, Kunal Sood is adept at empowering disruptive innovators and social entrepreneurs to turn their dreams into real world impact. He does this through designing immersive experiences both in-person and online since the global pandemic broke out to give everyone a seat at the table and a voice to citizens around the world.

Soodâs ability to architect and bridge the worlds of power and influence with meaning and purpose sets him apart from others in his field by bringing together leaders from the bottom of the pyramid to the top. He is a force of nature that makes the impossible possible both with his vision and leadership.

To create an exponential legacy for our planet, #WeThePlanet will launch a campaign during their annual flagship Earth Day Summit called Operation #HOPE (Help Our Planet Everyday) to drive everyday solutions to protect all life on land and under the sea. âUltimately, I believe that impacting a billion lives is more powerful than just becoming a billionaire in this brave new world,â says Sood.

#WeThePlanet and 3deluxe's continued partnership and steadfast commitment to architecting the future is in alignment with Sir David Attenboroughâs views that many individuals are doing what they can, but real success can only come if there is a change in our societies, our economies and our built infrastructure. âAn understanding of the natural world and what's in it is a source of not only a great curiosity but great fulfillment,â Attenborough famously stated.

This is how we begin to transform our world for a better future. ""After the shock of the pandemic and the social polarization of recent years, there is a longing for positive change,"" says Dieter Brell, Creative Director and Founder of 3deluxe in Germany who has partnered with Kunal Sood and Laura Muranaka at #WeThePlanet to launch The ARK in New York City. âIt is time for architecture and urbanism to take a more ambitious approach to humanize our living environment,â said Brell.

â#WeThePlanet House will integrate more natural biotopes in urban environments to help biodiversity and increase the disappearing habitat for insects, birds and plants.â Architecting a better future by reimagining the city skyline in a post-COVID world led Brell, Sood and Muranaka to conceptualize the We The Planet Campus last year amidst the global pandemic. On Earth Day 2021, they will launch the first-ever #WeThePlanet House and rooftop called The ARK that will help extract carbon from the atmosphere while making the New York skyline greener.

The ARK will serve as a space that will reimagine how we convene, learn and work towards a more sustainable lifestyle that promotes human longevity and planetary flourishing in order to effectively address the negative effects of climate change and protect against future pandemics.

The 50/50 concept developed by 3deluxe foresees architecture for the future that centers on shared spaces for both people and nature. In the future, all building projects should give back to the urban environment.

âLetâs reimagine the urban jungle as a true jungle in the worldâs most extraordinary cities,â says Sood. This would mean that as compensation for soil sealing, CO2 production, and the use of energy and raw materials, new living environments would be created for flora and fauna (neophytes). #WeThePlanet's Operation #HOPE (Help Our Planet Everyday) is transforming New York City one existing building at a time to make the impossible possible in urban environments.

#WeThePlanetâs vision to make all aspects of protecting the planet a deeply meaningful calling uniting all generations in action from age one to 100 is inspiring a new generation of extraordinary leadership.

The integration of different habitats at #WeThePlanet House is intended to promote biodiversity for a wide variety of species. The breathtaking interlinking of areas for people and habitats for animals reflects the give and take attitude necessary to architect buildings of the future in a balanced way. The rooftop campus functions as an educational platform in which youth and elders can continually learn something new from nature in a mixed-use urban environment.

NEW DELHI: Consumer confidence among urban Indians weakened by 1.1 percentage points in April 2021 amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, as per a monthly Refinitiv-Ipsos Primary Consumer Sentiment Index (PCSI) survey.

Consumer sentiment was down across all 4 indices -- jobs, personal finances, economy and investments for the future, the survey said.

The online survey was conducted between March 26, 2021, and April 9, 2021. A sample size of 500 adults from Ipsos' India online panel aged 16-64 years were interviewed.

The monthly PCSI is driven by the aggregation of the four weighted sub-indices.

PCSI Employment Confidence (Jobs) sub-index is down by 0.6 percentage points, Current Personal Financial Conditions (Current Conditions) sub-index fell 1.5 percentage points, and Investment Climate (Investment) sub-index declined 0.9 percentage points.

Economic Expectations sub-index slipped by 0.8 percentage points in the survey.

""The second wave of the coronavirus is in full swing and it is already starting to impact normalcy and livelihoods. Businesses had started recovering post the first wave, and now the new wave (which is more infectious) has already started to negatively impact the sentiment around jobs, finances for the daily running of households, savings and investments and the economy,"" Ipsos India CEO Amit Adarkar said.

Refinitiv-Ipsos India Primary Consumer Sentiment Index is a monthly survey of consumer attitude on the current and future state of local economies, personal finance situations, savings and confidence to make large investments.

NEW DELHI: With cargo proving to be the only bright spot for airlines during the pandemic, Indiaâs largest carrier â IndiGo â has decided to hitch on this wagon.

It will make a start with four Airbus A321s converted from passenger planes to freighters. Struggling-to-survive SpiceJet is the only Indian carrier with freighters at the moment.

IndiGo is scheduled to get its first freighter by the June, and that will be used for both domestic and regional missions.

The remaining three aircraft are within a year âand further aircraft may be sourced depending on market development.â

IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta said: âCarGo has been a success story over the last year, scaling new heights and creating new records, but our belief in the cargo business goes beyond the special circumstances right now. IndiGo was already the largest carrier of cargo in domestic India before Covid-19, and we expect the market to continue to grow after the pandemic.""

""ur investment in the Airbus Freighter Programme will help strengthen our product and services in the segment, and not only help accelerate our own business recovery but also be a strong engine of economic growth for the country,â he added.

The low cost carrier, which flies one in every two domestic travellers, is sourcing four A321ceo aircraft each of which will be converted from passenger to a full freighter configuration.

A letter of intent has already been signed with a lessor for two aircraft and the agreement for the next two is expected to be signed shortly. âThe initiative will make best use of the natural synergies, using the same pool of pilots and engineers that fly and service its current fleet,â the airline said in a statement.

The A321P2F (passenger-to-freighter conversion) offers 24 container positions and supports a payload of up to 27 tonnes.

","PUNE: United Airlines continues to lead the industry towards a more sustainable future with the launch of the first-of-its-kind Eco-Skies Alliance SM program , its officials claimed recently.

Working with the airline, more than a dozen leading global corporations will collectively contribute towards the purchase of approximately 3.4 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) this year.

With its nearly 80% emissions reductions on a lifecycle basis compared to conventional jet fuel, this is enough SAF to eliminate approximately 31,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, or enough to fly passengers over 220 million miles.

âWhile weâve partnered with companies for years to help them offset their flight emissions, we applaud those participating in the Eco-Skies Alliance for recognizing the need to go beyond carbon offsets and support SAF-powered flying, which will lead to more affordable supply and ultimately, lower emissions,â said United CEO Scott Kirby.

âThis is just the beginning. Our goal is to add more companies to the Eco-Skies Alliance program, purchase more SAF and work across industries to find other innovative paths towards decarbonization,â he added.

In addition to the Eco-Skies Alliance program, United is giving customers the ability to contribute funds for additional SAF purchase or for use on initiatives United believes will help decarbonize aviation â the first of any US airline to do so.

","GameStop decoupled some of Sherman's pay from his performance last year in the early months of the Covid-19 pa... Read More

NEW DELHI: Gamestop Corp chief executive George Sherman can step down this summer with a $179 million windfall that dwarfs CEO salaries at many larger corporations thanks to a sweetheart deal that was turbocharged by this year's furious meme stock rally, compensation experts said.

GameStop said on Monday that Sherman would step down by July 31. The struggling US videogame retailer has been seeking a new leader to work on its e-commerce transition with chairman Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy Inc.

GameStop decoupled some of Sherman's pay from his performance last year in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic and granted him stock when its shares were worth a tiny fraction of their current value, according to a Reuters review of security filings and interviews with compensation consultants.

As a condition of his exit, GameStop is speeding up the time frame for Sherman to receive the shares, generating the award.

Sherman, who has been CEO since April 2019, forfeited $98 million worth of stock this month because he did not meet performance targets, GameStop disclosed last week.

Still, he stands to receive a stock payout currently worth $179 million because GameStop granted him more shares linked to his tenure at the company rather than to his performance as most companies do with their CEO, said Eric Hoffmann, a vice president at compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC.

""Investors like awards that are performance-based, that have hard pre-established financial goals that the executives have to meet to earn, as opposed to time-based shares, where they just have to hang on to get them,"" Hoffmann said.

A spokesman at Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop declined to comment. Sherman did not respond to requests for comment. Cohen, GameStop's largest shareholder with a 13% stake, could not be reached for comment.

The value of Sherman's severance payout surpasses annual salaries given to many top US CEOs. ViacomCBS Inc CEO Joseph Ianniello took home $112.9 million in realized pay in 2019, while JPMorgan Chase & Co's Jamie Dimon's 2019 realized pay hit $107.8 million, according to the most recent tally by corporate governance data provider CGLytics.

Other GameStop employees will not share in Sherman's windfall. The retailer has been shuttering hundreds of stores, according to securities disclosures.

GameStop's shares closed at $158.53 on Tuesday, a stratospheric rise from around $5 last summer, when the company granted the bulk of the stock award to Sherman. They skyrocketed in January as individual traders on Reddit and other social media platforms snapped them up, squeezing short sellers.

Reuters reported last year how some companies were shielding executives from the financial fallout of the pandemic by moving from performance-based to time-based payouts. They reasoned that the market disruption made it difficult to meet financial targets, and Sherman will benefit from that trend.

Sherman, 59, has been credited internally with slashing costs and steering GameStop through the pandemic that put other retailers out of business, Reuters reported last week.

But his 25 years of experience have been largely with brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Advance Auto Parts Inc and Home Depot Inc. Cohen wants a top executive with skills better suited for GameStop's digital transformation, Reuters reported.

Vesting of shares

GameStop granted Sherman roughly 925,000 shares last June that he was set to receive in thirds over three years, according to regulatory filings.

He is set to receive them all at once upon his exit under terms of a ""transition agreement"" negotiated this month, as well as roughly 200,000 more shares that had not previously vested, the filings show. The filings do not disclose how GameStop's board decided on these awards.

Sherman also stood to eventually receive 308,477 shares awarded last June that were tied to his performance, separate from the stock he forfeited last week. He agreed to forgo those performance-based shares as well, one of the filings shows. It was not clear whether he would have met the performance targets.

GameStop has said Sherman plans to remain on the board of directors without pay to help the next CEO transition into the role.

","WASHINGTON: Discussion platform Discord, popular among amateur video game players, has halted acquisition talks with Microsoft and is instead considering its options for a public offering , the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.

Media reported last month that the social platform, created in 2015, was engaged in discussions about a transaction with the technology giant that would have valued Discord at $10 billion.

Discord, which is based in San Francisco, allows its 140 million monthly users to exchange text, audio and video for free.

The platform, which is not yet profitable, generated about $130 million in revenue in 2020 from $45 million the year before as it grew beyond just ""gamers"" to other users as well during the pandemic, according to the Journal.

At least three different companies have expressed interest in acquiring Discord, the newspaper said, citing anonymous sources.

Picking up Discord would have allowed Microsoft to expand its social presence beyond LinkedIn , the professional network it acquired in 2016.

And Discord sees a large group of users among gamers using Xbox, Microsoft's video game brand that ranges from consoles to mobile games to streaming services.

But Discord may instead be looking toward a market debut, the Wall Street Journal said, following in the footsteps of other recent public offerings from the video game world such as collaborative gaming platform Roblox.

","WASHINGTON: More than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, millions of American remain jobless, but even as the economy reopens some employers are finding hiring an unexpected challenge.

From fears of being infected with the coronavirus to trouble finding childcare to the lure of generous unemployment benefits, some jobless Americans are holding off on re-entering the workforce.

""It's a paradox for the Covid crisis,"" said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. ""We have, and risk having over the coming months, an imbalance between job openings and demand.""

The US economy has begun to recover as Covid-19 vaccines allow businesses to return to normal, and companies are starting to recruit to meet growing demand.

But not all unemployed workers are ready to return to their jobs, analysts say.

""The main issue is we still have a pandemic, and there is huge concern among job seekers about workplace health and safety,"" said Julia Pollak, an economist for job search website ZipRecruiter.

A quarter of the US population is fully vaccinated, well ahead of Europe and many other major economies, but three-quarters of the country nonetheless remains at risk of contracting Covid-19.

And childcare is another challenge for working parents, since only a little more than half of the nation's schools are back to full-time classes after the pandemic forced them to close or modify operations, according to FutureEd, a think tank at Georgetown University.

The Covid-19 pandemic destroyed 22 million jobs in the world's largest economy, of which more than half, 14 million, have been restored.

However, nearly 17 million people are still receiving government unemployment aid, including self-employed workers, and many are working part-time because they cannot find full-time work.

But Daco said worker shortages are being seen across multiple sectors, including some of those hardest hit by the waves of layoffs, like retail, food service, hospitality and entertainment.

In a survey of US businesses conducted between late February and early April, the Federal Reserve noted ""hiring remained a widespread challenge, particularly for low-wage or hourly workers, restraining job growth in some cases.""

A hotelier surveyed by the Federal Reserve bank in Richmond, Virginia reported that ""they were able to hire some front desk workers but had unfilled cleaning staff positions and little interest from workers in those jobs.""

The central bank's Chicago branch reported a number of factors keeping unemployed workers at home, including ""financial support from the government,"" like the extra $300 weekly benefit jobless employees will receive through August.

The Chicago Fed cited other complications in the hiring process including finding childcare, concerns about the virus, difficulty obtaining public transportation and ""job search fatigue.""

ZipRecruiter's Pollak said some workers also are fearful that if they take a job, they will simply be let go again.

""Many people experienced getting laid off as a really hard blow,"" she said, comparing the situation to people ""who got divorced now being scared to go back into the dating market and get married again.""

""They're not in a rush to put themselves back in a vulnerable position, especially since the extended and expanded benefits are giving them a little bit of time,"" Pollak said.

Some Americans have taken to working from home, which makes it easier to combine work with family life and not spend time commuting.

""Many people are not prepared to go back old jobs they had,"" Pollak said, and are instead holding out for remote work opportunities.

This trend has hit the restaurant industry in particular, which is hoping to see a rebound in the spring and summer after the pandemic forced many to close starting in March 2020.

""As the weather improves and more state restrictions are lifted, restaurant traffic will increase and that will create a greater need for employees,"" Hudson Riehle, who heads research for the National Restaurant Association, told AFP.

""With fewer people in the workforce, the stimulus supports still in place, worker safety concerns and much greater competition with other industries for workers,"" Riehle predicted some eateries may offer higher pay or additional benefits and opportunities to coax workers.

Amazon, Costco , Target and Walmart -- which run some of the largest distribution firms in the United States -- already announced pay increases.

","NEW DELHI: As Tesla firms up its plans to roll out its first all-electric car in India this year, the Elon Musk-run company has hired top executives in the country who has taken charge of some of its operations in the country.

After Musk confirmed Tesla's arrival in India, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa declared in February that the US-based electric vehicle and clean energy company will set up its production unit here. Tesla has already registered its office in Bengaluru.

Now, it has ramped up hiring for top positions and has onboarded IIM Bangalore alumnus Manuj Khurana as Policy and Business Development head for India operations.

The company has hired Nishant as charging manager who will head the supercharging, destination charging and home charging business for Tesla India. He was earlier head of Charging Infrastructure and Energy Storage at homegrown electric vehicle company Ather Energy .

Tesla India now has a Country HR leader in Chithra Thomas who earlier worked at Walmart and Reliance Retail.

""Tesla India is moving full speed ahead with building local team. We are excited to see the progress. Hoping to see you (Musk) in India when @Tesla delivers the first cars,"" Tesla Club India said in a tweet on Wednesday.

On January 12, Yediyurappa had tweeted from his official handle that Tesla would start its operations in India with an R&D unit in Bengaluru.

Breaking his silence after the news broke that Tesla has finally entered India by registering it as a company in Bengaluru, Musk said on January 13 that he is on the way to fulfil his promise to let electric cars run on the roads of India.

Last week, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said that he has invited Tesla to start manufacturing EVs in India.

During his address at The Raisina Dialogue 2021, he said that it is golden opportunity for the company to start manufacturing in India.

""I had a video conference with Tesla management. I suggested them that it is a golden opportunity for them to start manufacturing here in India,"" he said.

Gadkari also said that he has assured the company that the government will help them set up industrial clusters in the country.

Exuding confidence on Indian EV makers, he said that ""Indian products are also improving and within two years, we will get e-vehicles of Tesla standard in Indian market.""

""So, in the interest of Tesla, I suggested that you start manufacturing in India as early as possible it will be beneficial for you,"" the minister added.

","NEW DELHI: The global lead-acid battery industry is worth about $65 billion annually, but when used batteries are recycled, the process has been identified as the most polluting in the world.

The lead metal value from smelters that mainly recycle used batteries, is expected to be $17.5 billion in 2021, according to Wood Mackenzie principal lead analyst Farid Ahmed.

Below are some of the key facts about this industry:

Potent neurotoxin

Lead is the main element used in lead-acid batteries.

The metal currently trades around $2,000 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange .

Environment agencies Pure Earth and Green Cross Switzerland have said lead battery recycling is the most polluting industry in the world.

Lead is a potent neurotoxin, especially in children, where even low-level exposure is associated with a reduction in IQ scores, shortened attention spans and potentially violent and even criminal behaviour later in life, according to a United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund and Pure Earth report.

Blood lead levels (BLL) of over 5 micrograms of lead per decilitre (ugdl) of blood are considered dangerous by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

About 800 million children worldwide have dangerously high levels of the heavy metal, according to the UNICEF and Pure Earth report.

Their exposure to lead includes breathing dust and fumes from informal and backyard lead-acid battery recycling units and open-air smelters, eating food contaminated by lead-glazed pottery and working in electronic waste dumps.

Informal sector

As much as half of the lead-acid battery recycling in the world ends up in the ""informal"" sector, according to the UNICEF- Pure Earth report.

A white paper by the Global Battery Alliance in partnership with the World Economic Forum estimates that there are between 10,000 to 30,000 informal battery recycling sites globally.

Africa, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia are among the regions blighted by informal recycling but not all operations there are informal or of poor standard, International Lead Association Regulatory Affairs Director Dr. Steve Binks said.

In China, the world's largest lead-acid battery market, a large portion of used lead-acid batteries has been recycled in an unorganised way, said Jianbin Meng, Director of Economics and Environment at the Portugal-based International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG).

Lead recycling

In 2020, about 12.4 million tonnes of refined lead was produced, including from primary or mined sources and secondary sources, according to Wood Mackenzie data.

About two-thirds of refined lead is produced through recycling.

About 86% of refined lead is used in lead acid battery production in the world, according to estimates by ILZSG.

Largest sector for lead-acid batteries

By value, about 60% of lead-acid batteries are used in cars, according to data estimated by the International Lead Association.

Lead-acid batteries are also used in industrial machinery like forklifts and cranes, as well as in data centres and e-bikes.

Refined lead consumption for batteries

China was the biggest market player in terms of lead consumption for batteries followed by Europe and the United States.

"Ahead of Earth Day 2021, photographer Ismail Shariff — whose eye-catching wildlife photography of snow leopards in the Himalayas has gone viral — tells us how to pick out this elusive big cat in its natural habitat

Hyderabad-based wildlife photographer Ismail Shariff was enroute to Ladakh on work when he decided to take a break at Dras, in Kargil, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Himalayan brown bear. Ismail and his team knew they were in luck when they learnt that a brown bear had strayed into a nearby village for food; he whipped out his camera and captured them at leisure.

While Ismail’s photos of the brown bear show the mammal in all its glory, something unexpected happened when he posted the shots on various wildlife photos websites — his photos of a snow leopard in 2017 resurfaced started trending, receiving over 12,000 shares and 58,000 likes.

Read More | Ismail Shariff on why wildlife photographers should exercise restraint

“The snow leopard has been my muse ever since I first saw its photograph in 2012 taken by Dhritiman Mukherjee, the baap of Indian wildlife photography,” he says over the phone.

Ismail started photographing snow leopards in 2014; this particular photograph that has gone viral shows the animal camouflaged in the rocky Himalayan terrain. Ismail is a regular to Spiti Valley; every year he visits to photograph snow leopards. The last time he went was in February 2020, just before the nation went into lockdown. “Unfortunately, my hard disk crashed and the only image that I could salvage was that of the snow leopard drinking water.”

‘A trained eye’

A snow leopard expedition conductor for bespoke tour operator Voygr in India and Central Asia, Ismail says that it is an extremely shy animal. “One needs trained eyes to spot it in the snow,” he adds. Snow leopards are smaller in size to regular leopards found in the wild, but they appear bigger due to their thick fur.

“The thickness of their fur in the stomach can be upto 12 inches, and the tail is as long as its body. The snow leopard uses its bushy tail as a muffler to wrap around when sleeping curled up,” he notes.

It took him several visits to track the animal’s movement in the snow. “The photograph resurfacing shows that there are a lot of people who are learning about Indian wildlife.”

The comments on his viral photo made him wonder if conducting online sessions may help add more awareness on the elusive big cat. “I will conduct sessions for another week,” he says.","At just 0.7 milimetres long, the mites are miniscule and harmless to people, Shimano said. They are a type of coastal mite that eats algae and lichen and lives in a group.

Call it the mite of Twitter: Japanese and Austrian researchers have confirmed a bug they spotted posted in a tweet is a previously unknown species. It is now aptly dubbed Ameronothrus twitter.

Satoshi Shimano, a professor at Tokyo's Hosei University, stumbled upon snaps of the black mites — posted by an amateur photographer — as he was browsing Twitter last year.

The pictures showed a group of the tiny arachnids massing in a crack in a concrete wharf at the fishing port of Choshi, southeast of the capital.

""Immediately after I saw them, I thought they were different from others I knew, and thought that they could be a new species,"" Shimano told AFP.

He contacted the photographer through Twitter to confirm the location and then visited the port to collect samples, later confirming with his team that the mites represented a previously unknown species.

At just 0.7 milimetres long, the mites are miniscule and harmless to people, Shimano said. They are a type of coastal mite that eats algae and lichen and lives in a group.

Shimano and his team decided to pay tribute to Twitter's role in bringing the mite to their attention when naming the mite.

""I suggested the name to link the discovery with modern society,"" Shimano told AFP. ""I hope the name will help attract more people to learn about the world of this particular research,"" he said.

Shimano is also enthusiastic about the prospect of social media helping uncover more new species, harnessing the force of millions of users around the world for scientific discovery.

The team, including Tobias Pfingstl, a mite specialist at the University of Graz in Austria, published details of the new bug in the journal Species Diversity on March 22.

It's not the first time Twitter has helped reveal previously unknown species — though such discoveries are believed to be rare. In 2020, the University of Copenhagen announced its experts had discovered a new fungal parasite after spotting some unusual marks on a photo of a millipede shared on Twitter."

Chelsea were held to a 0-0 draw at home by Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League on Tuesday, a match overshadowed by reports that the Blues had ditched their plan to join the planned breakaway European Super League.

In a setback for Chelsea’s push to qualify for next season’s Champions League — the competition they had controversially planned to snub — the hosts failed to find a way through the well marshalled defence of relegation-threatened Brighton.

Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel was left to voice his frustration loudly in his native German as his expensively assembled team saw every attack mopped up by the visitors’ back line led by captain Lewis Dunk.

Brighton substitute Adam Lallana wasted a glorious chance when he pounced on an error by Chelsea centre back Kurt Zouma but fired wide in the 77th minute. Danny Welbeck struck a post two minutes later as Brighton pushed for a shock win.

Brighton defender Ben White was sent off for a second yellow card in the 92nd minute.

The draw pushed Chelsea up into fourth place on goal difference above West Ham United who they are due visit on Saturday. Brighton remained in 16th place, seven points ahead of Fulham who occupy the highest of the relegation spots.

The game lacked the drama seen outside Stamford Bridge before the match where hundreds of angry Chelsea fans demonstrated against the club’s plan to join the ESL. The protests turned to celebrations as media reported that Chelsea had begun the process of withdrawing from the breakaway league with fans singing: “We’ve got our club back.”","United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham joined Manchester City in withdrawing from the proposed Super League, with Chelsea reportedly set to follow.

The proposed European Super League collapsed on Tuesday after Premier League clubs withdrew from the deeply divisive project following a furious backlash by fans and threats from football authorities.

Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal were six of the 12 leading European clubs to initially sign up to the breakaway competition designed to guarantee spots each year and billions of dollars for its founding members.

But reaction to the plans has been scathing, with politicians and football authorities threatening to take legal action against the so-called ""dirty dozen"", who were told they faced potential bans from domestic and continental competitions.

United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham joined Manchester City in withdrawing from the proposed Super League, with Chelsea reportedly set to follow.

That leaves just six sides — Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus still involved in the project — which appears to be dead.

City had issued a statement announcing they were pulling out of the project after feverish speculation that the Premier League leaders and Chelsea were set to withdraw.

""Manchester City Football Club can confirm that it has formally enacted the procedures to withdraw from the group developing plans for a European Super League,"" the club said in a brief statement.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said he was ""delighted"" by City's decision to pull out, with the other clubs issuing similar statements.

The English Football Association said it welcomed moves by clubs to abandon plans for the Super League, praising fans for ""their influential and unequivocal voice"".

Reigning European champions Bayern Munich and French giants Paris Saint-Germain both came out strongly opposed to the breakaway league.

Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson tweeted a statement on behalf of the squad, saying: ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen. This is our collective position.""

On a day of intense drama, Manchester United announced that executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward would step down from his role at the end of 2021.

Earlier, Ceferin, addressing the owners, particularly of the Premier League teams involved, said there was still time for clubs to pull out.

""Some will say it is greed, some complete ignorance of England's football culture,"" he said. ""There's still time to change your mind. Everyone makes mistakes.""

FIFA president Gianni Infantino issued a stark warning to the heavyweight clubs who had signed up to the ESL.

""It is our task to protect the European sport model, so if some elect to go their own way then they must live with the consequences of their choices,"" Infantino said at UEFA's congress in Switzerland.

Chelsea protest

More than 1,000 fans gathered outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium to protest against the plan before Tuesday's Premier League match against Brighton, which ended in a 0-0 draw.

Fans held up signs reading: ""RIP Football 1863 — 2021"", ""Created by the poor, stolen by the rich"", ""We want our cold nights in Stoke"" and ""Roman do the right thing"" — in reference to Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich.

Less than two hours after the protesters made their feelings known, it was first reported that Chelsea were preparing documentation to withdraw from the competition.

Abramovich is understood to have driven the decision, which is yet to be made official.

British Prime Minster Boris Johnson earlier met Premier League clubs, the FA and fan groups, vowing to do all in his power to kill the ESL plan.

He tweeted later, before City's decision was confirmed: ""The decision by Chelsea and Manchester City is — if confirmed — absolutely the right one and I commend them for it.""

The 20-team ESL was designed by the European giants to guarantee revenue from regular matches against one another without the risk of failing to qualify for 15 founder members.

'It's not a sport'

However, the plan was fiercely criticised by even their own players and managers for acting as a closed shop.

""It's not a sport when the relation between effort and reward doesn't exist,"" said Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola.

""It's not a sport when success is already guaranteed, it's not a sport if it doesn't matter if you lose.""

The 12 teams had signed up to share in an initial pot of more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.2 billion) — vastly boosting their revenues, which have been badly hit during the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the proposals, announced late Sunday, five more clubs would have had to qualify for the 20-team midweek competition, joining the 15 permanent members.

Currently, teams have to qualify for the Champions League each year through their national competitions, and survive a group phase before reaching the high-profile latter stages.

The breakaway announcement came just hours before UEFA announced a new, 36-team format for the Champions League, which had been conceived to placate the continent's biggest clubs."

“I was 2477 before leaving for Serbia and needed 23 points to become a GM. I am happy that I did that beating Kosic,” Arjun told The Hindu on Wednesday.

Arjun said that he was relieved to achieve the feat as he had come close to becoming a GM quite a few times earlier.

The postponement of the India Open, which was scheduled to be held in New Delhi from May 11 and is an Olympics qualifying tournament, is disheartening and shows that the players’ interests are not taken care of, said P. Kashyap, husband of Saina Nehwal.

Helpless

“It is really upsetting that the Delhi event is postponed. We are helpless.

“We have serious doubts whether anyone cares for the players when they take these decisions,” the 34-year-old Kashyap told The Hindu here on Wednesday.

Kashyap, who also dons the role of a mentor to Saina besides pursuing his own career, said the India Open, along with Malaysian and the Singapore Opens, are the last three Olympics qualifying events and now players like Saina and Srikanth are left with only the last two events.

“Our calculations were that if Saina were to make it to the quarterfinals in two of the three tournaments, her chances of making the Olympics cut were bright,” Kashyap said. “Now, it has come to two out of two. It is not going to be easy and I strongly believe no one cares about the players getting a fair chance of qualifying for the Games.

“Exactly for this reason, I feel the All England Championships early this year should also have been treated as a qualifying event.”

Kashyap added that Saina is nearing full fitness, despite being troubled by niggles which are taking a long time to heal.

Tough phase

“It has been a very tough last two years for her. Because of the pandemic, the conditions are bad.

“But when IPL and tennis can go on, a way should be found out to ensure the Olympics qualifying events are held,” he said.

“Now all we can do is to hope that at least the Malaysian and Singapore Opens will be held on schedule.”","IPL 2021, KKR vs CSK Live Score: Both skippers have struggled in the bat so far in the tournament

IPL 2021, KKR vs CSK Live Cricket Score Online Updates: After the toss in the first game against Delhi Capitals, Chennai Super Kings have come back well winning the next two matches. CSK may make one change in the top order. Opener Ruturaj Gaikwad has not been able to deliver as an opener. He can be replaced by IPL veteran Robin Uthappa who is yet to make his CSK debut. The rest of the expected to remain the same despite Lungi Ngidi’s availability for selection. In the last game, CSK relied on cameos to post a big total. They will be hoping for a big innings from one of their players.

On the other hand, Kolkata Knight Riders have disappointed in their last two games after a comprehensive win in their first match. There can be a few changes in the KKR lineup. Sunil Narine is available for selection and can replace Shakib Al Hasan. KKR have suffered batting collapses in their previous two games. Skipper Eoin Morgan has struggled as well. There can be a shuffle in the KKR batting order to help them score in middle overs and keep wickets intact.","Chennai: Syed Khaleel Ahmed of Sunrisers Hyderabad and David Warner captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad celebrates the wicket of Fabian Allen of Punjab Kings during match 14 of the Indian Premier League 2021 between the Punjab Kings and the Sunrisers Hyderabad held at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai, Wednesday, April 21, 2021. (Source: PTI)

Sunrisers Hyderabad got their team selection right, and were rewarded with a resounding nine-wicket win. After their first three matches, they were rock bottom. Their net run rate was gasping for an upgrade. On Wednesday at Chepauk, after bundling out Punjab Kings for 120, they won with eight balls remaining.

Bowlers did the job for SRH. Khaleel Ahmed with three wickets was first among equals. After that, David Warner and Jonny Bairstow put on 73 runs for the opening wicket. The latter stayed till the end to make the win hiccup-free. Punjab, in their first match in Chennai, allowed conditions to get the better of them.

First among equals

Khaleel is a talented left-arm pacer, good enough to play 11 ODIs and 14 T20Is. But inconsistency hasn’t served him well. A fractured wrist early in 2020 was a setback as well. On Wednesday, slower deliveries did the trick for him.

Mayank Agarwal mistimed a pull and was caught by Rashid Khan at mid-wicket. The Punjab opener had had a reprieve in the very first over, Rashid dropping him off Abhishek Sharma on nought. On a day when KL Rahul fell cheaply, Agarwal was Punjab’s biggest hope for a good total. He failed to capitalise on the early life.

Fabian Allen, too, was taken out by a short-of-a-length slower ball, the batsman slicing it to extra cover. Khaleel’s third victim was Shahrukh Khan, who was impressive, but went for a slog to a slower delivery in the penultimate over. His team was crawling and the youngster had to chance his arm.

Spare a thought for Abhishek Sharma, who dismissed Deepak Hooda and Moises Henriques, two hard hitters, to give Sunrisers a significant advantage. An arm ball foxed Hooda, while Henriques was done in by a flighted delivery.

On a dark and dry Chepauk pitch, it was never easy for Punjab to get into the groove straightaway. At the same time, their batting beyond the opening pair doesn’t inspire much confidence. When Rahul and Agarwal fire, Punjab revel. Chris Gayle, despite being the x-factor, has become more of a gamble at this stage of his career.

Jonny boy

Adding to Punjab’s troubles, their best bowler hasn’t started to fire on all cylinders yet. Coming into this IPL, Mohammed Shami hadn’t played any cricket after suffering a broken arm in Adelaide in December last year. His radar is still not working.

Warner slashed him for a four to put pressure on the bowler right at the outset. Allen bowled the next over and Bairstow took a four and a six. To make matters worse, Punjab missed a run-out – Sunrisers’ ground fielding was excellent on the contrary – when Bairstow was 15. Punjab looked to have thrown in the towel a little too early.

Sunrisers, though, had to ensure there was no middle-overs meltdown. So, it was important for Bairstow to carry on. He did that, scoring 63 not out off 56 balls. Kane Williamson, back to full fitness, offered an assured presence alongside the opener. Sunrisers had missed his class and calmness in the previous three matches.","MS Dhoni is currently in Mumbai playing in the IPL. (CSK/Twitter)

After their abject campaign in UAE last year, the CSK started the season in an ominous fashion, losing to Delhi Capitals by seven wickets in a one-sided affair. But since then, the MS Dhoni-led side has come on its own with the ‘Captain Cool’ making the most of his resources at the batting-friendly Wankhede stadium.

Playing XI:

CSK: Ruturaj Gaikwad, Faf du Plessis, Moeen Ali, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni(w/c), Sam Curran, Shardul Thakur, Lungi Ngidi, Deepak Chahar

KKR: Nitish Rana, Shubman Gill, Rahul Tripathi, Eoin Morgan(c), Dinesh Karthik(w), Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy, Prasidh Krishna","Punjab Kings (PBKS) skipper KL Rahul broke Virat Kohli’s record to become the fastest Indian batsman to 5,000 T20 runs. Rahul took 143 innings to reach the milestone whereas Kohli took 167 innings. Rahul needed just one run to reach the milestone before the match. The 29-year-old could manage only four runs from six deliveries before losing his wicket to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) opening bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

Rahul has 2,808 IPL runs from 76 innings so far including two centuries and 23 half-centuries. The leading run-scorer of all-time in IPL is currently Kohli with 5,949 runs to his name from 187 innings.

In the ongoing IPL season, Rahul has scored 161 runs from four innings including two half-centuries. He scored a quickfire 91 in the first game against Rajasthan Royals (RR). However, PBKS have lost three out of their four games in the season so far.

“We knew what to expect here. Tried to get used to the conditions as quickly as we can. We were 10-15 short on this pitch. Bowlers tried very hard, but it’s very hard coming into these conditions and adapting quickly. Hindsight is a beautiful thing. We knew they were going to come hard. It’s tricky to have attacking fields. Was waiting for one of them to get out and then put pressure. Wanted to take the game as deep as possible. Unfortunately, we couldn’t get wickets in the middle and that cost us. Every game is important for us and we’ve been in that position. It’s not a bad position to be in. Hopefully, learn from our mistakes and keep getting better,” Rahul said after the match.

SRH beat PBKS at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai by nine wickets with eight balls to spare. Earlier, Rahul won the toss and elected to bat first. PBKS batsmen failed to stitch a big partnership but kept losing wickets at regular intervals and posted a modest total of 120. Khaleel Ahmed picked up three wickets and Abhishek Sharma picked up two wickets. Bhuvneshwar, Siddharth Kaul and Rashid Khan picked up one wicket each. SRH opener Jonny Bairstow lead the run chase as he remained unbeaten for 63.","IPL 2021, PBKS vs SRH

Punjab Kings won the toss and opted to bat first. The slide began with KL Rahul’s wicket for 4 as Bhuvneshwar Kumar gave SRH a dream start. Mayank Agarwal (22) stuck around to keep Punjab afloat in the Powerplay but wickets kept falling at regular intervals. Rashid Khan (1/17) and Abhishek Sharma (2/24) turned the screws into their middle order before Khaleel Ahmed (3/21) delivered the killing blow with the wicket of Shahrukh Khan (22), the joint highest scorer in the innings. In reply, David Warner and Jonny Bairstow got off to a roaring start, getting 50 runs in the Powerplay. Kane Williamson joined Bairstow, who remained unbeaten on 63 at close of play, as SRH then reverted to a cautious approach, reaching the target in the 19th over.","In-form opener Mohammad Rizwan blazed an unbeaten half-century as Pakistan defeated hosts Zimbabwe by 11 runs in the first Twenty20 International at the Harare Sports Club on Wednesday.

Rizwan played a lone hand for his team with 82 not out as they posted 149 for seven in their 20 overs.

The home side, who have not qualified for the T20 World Cup in India later this year, were always just behind the rate and could only manage 138 for seven in reply.

After being sent in to bat, the Pakistan innings was dominated by Rizwan, who’s unbeaten 82 came from 61 balls. No-one else scored more than 15, with off-spinner Wesley Madhevere the pick of the home bowling attack with 2-11 from two overs.

Craig Ervine top scored in the Zimbabwe reply with 34, but he was out to leg-spinner Usman Qadir (3-29), who also claimed the key wicket of home captain Sean Williams (9). Usman is the son of former Pakistan great Abdul Qadir and made his debut in the recent series in South Africa.

There has been disappointment over the low position Dhoni has batted in so far this season. (Twitter/CSK)

Question marks continue to persist over MS Dhoni’s batting form, but the ‘inspirational leadership’ he showed in Chennai Super Kings’ victory against Rajasthan Royals on Monday makes CSK one of the favorites in IPL 2021, according to experts.

The skipper came in at No.7 on Monday, scoring 18 runs in 17 balls. His strike rate may have been the most modest among middle-order batsmen, but he showed glimpses of genius from behind the stumps in RR’s batting innings. How he predicted Jos Buttler’s wicket, speaking in Hindi with Ravindra Jadeja, has been pointed out by many keen watchers.

Sunil Gavaskar, speaking on Star Sports, said, “The moment the ball was changed after Jos Buttler hit that six and a dry ball came, he said it in Hindi to Jadeja that the next ball will turn and it did turn. (Dhoni) then gave the ball to Moeen Ali. A dry ball for a spinner. Brilliant captaincy. He was spot on with everything — bowling changes, field placements.”

When butler hit jadeja for a six and then ball was replaced , you could hear dhoni on the stump mic saying that the ball will turn because it’s dry … that’s exactly what happened !! #ipl2021 #csk — Rohan Gavaskar (@rohangava9) April 19, 2021

Former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara said Dhoni can “take a rest” from batting and concentrate on leading CSK because the Chennai franchise has a long batting order this season. Lara also said Dhoni’s leadership can even take CSK to the title.

“CSK have got a very good team and a good leader who is inspirational. If he concentrates on that aspect of it, getting every single individual performing, they can go all the way,” Lara said.

‘Dhoni will continue to play at same position’

Meanwhile, there has been disappointment among fans that Dhoni has not pushed himself up the order, coming after Moeen Ali and Ravindra Jadeja and even Sam Curran sometimes in IPL 2021. However, according to experts, it would be futile to expect Dhoni to push himself up in the remaining part of the season too.

“He is extremely practical and pragmatic. He would know where he stands and where others stand. Trust him to take a call, it will not be putting himself above someone else in better form,” said Deep Dasgupta on Star Sports.

Pragyan Ojha added: “Everybody knows MS Dhoni. He knows exactly what he has to do. How ever much people say that he has to come up the order, he will continue to play at the same position.”

Speaking after the victory against RR, former India captain Dhoni said: “I wasn’t guaranteeing performances when I was 24, I can’t guarantee when I am 40, but at least if people can’t point fingers at me that he’s unfit then that will be a big positive for me. I have to keep up with the younger guys, they are very fast, it’s good to challenge them.”

Speaking on the sidelines of the match, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming had said: “Dhoni’s form is restoring, every time he gets some balls in the middle he’s going to get better and better.”

CSK will next play Kolkata Knight Riders on Wednesday. Dhoni, leading CSK for the 201st time, can be expected to bat at a position no higher than 7 once more.","The ICC on Wednesday banned United Arab Emirates (UAE) player Qadeer Ahmed Khan for five years from all cricket after he admitted breaching the anti-corruption code and also charged Mehardeep Chhayakar on six counts for corruption.

Khan was charged in October 2019.

“Mr Khan’s period of ineligibility has been backdated to 16 October 2019, when he was provisionally suspended,” the ICC release said.

The ICC said that Khan admitted to six breaches that relates to failing to disclose approaches or invitations received in relation to the Zimbabwe v UAE series in April 2019.

Khan disclosed inside information in August 2019 in circumstances where he knew or should have known that the information might be used for betting purposes.

He failed to disclose to the ACU full details of any approaches or invitations received in relation to the Netherlands v UAE series in August 2019.

He also failed to disclose full details of any facts or matters that came to his attention that may evidence corrupt conduct under the Code by another participant. He refused to cooperate with an investigation in relation to possible corrupt conduct under the Code.

He also concealed information that may be relevant to that investigation.

Alex Marshall, ICC General Manager Integrity Unit, said, “Qadeer Khan is an experienced international cricketer who has received anti-corruption training. He should have avoided the people he knew were corrupt and reported any suspicions immediately.”

Meanwhile, the ICC has charged Chhayakar, who has played domestic cricket in Ajman (UAE) with six counts of breaching the ICC Anti-Corruption Code.

AC Milan followed city rivals Inter on Wednesday and indicated their withdrawal from collapsing plans for a breakaway European Super League.

“The voices and the concerns of fans around the world have clearly been expressed about the Super League, and AC Milan must be sensitive to the voice of those who love this wonderful sport,” the Serie A club said in a statement.

“We will continue to work hard to deliver a sustainable model for football.”

Inter said earlier that they were no longer part of the project.

Milan were one of three Italian clubs among 12 founding members announced on Sunday but the plan fell apart when the six English Premier League clubs involved withdrew on Tuesday.

Spain’s Atletico Madrid have also pulled out, leaving Barcelona and Real Madrid still standing.

Juventus boss Andrea Agnelli told Reuters on Wednesday that the Super League, whose founding members would not have been exposed to relegation, could no longer proceed.

The clubs came under massive pressure from inside the sport and society at large, with politicians and even British royals adding their voices in opposition.

AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis had said on Tuesday that the proposed breakaway, a rival to the UEFA Champions League, would be good for the club and for whole of football.

Milan said in their statement they had accepted the invitation to participate “with the genuine intention to deliver the best possible European competition for football fans around the world and in the best interest of the club and our own fans.

“Change is not always easy, but evolution is necessary for progress, and the structures of European football have evolved and changed over the decades,” it added.","Delhi Capitals spinner Amit Mishra, who picked up a match-winning four-wicket haul against Mumbai Indians, said he particularly enjoyed dismissing opposition skipper Rohit Sharma and Kieron Pollard.

Mishra led the bowling charge with figures of 4/24 to help the Delhi franchise restrict the Mumbai Indians to 137/9.

“The wickets of Rohit Sharma and Kieron Pollard were special for me because they have been game changers for MI for many years. I always go for wickets in every match that I play,” said the 38-year-old in a team release.

“I had a clear-cut plan about where I should bowl and how I could dismiss each of the big players in the Mumbai Indians side through my variations. And I am very happy that I could execute my plans. I am even more happy about the Delhi Capitals winning the match.”

The Delhi Capitals had just a day’s gap between their match against Punjab Kings in Mumbai and their game against Mumbai Indians in Chennai.

However, Mishra said that the quick change of venues didn’t affect the players.

“It was a challenge to be ready for a game in a different venue in a short period of time, but as professional cricketers we know how to motivate ourselves and recover for the next match.

“The physio’s work is very important in these situations. And once we step on the field, we focus on our performance and we don’t think about anything else.”

Asked if DC’s recent poor record against MI was playing on the players’ mind before the match on Tuesday, Mishra said, “In T20s, we have to forget the past and take a fresh start in every match that we play in, because anyone can change the match on any given day.

“I don’t think any of the players were thinking about our recent record against MI. Like (Delhi Capitals Head Coach) Ricky Ponting has told us, we take every day as a new day, and we play positively in every match.”","Off to the best possible start with three wins on the trot, a confident Royal Challengers Bangalore will hope to keep the juggernaut rolling when they take on Rajasthan Royals in an IPL match in Mumbai on Thursday.

Both sides have endured contrasting campaigns so far.

RCB head in to the game after three morale-boosting victories. The Virat Kohli-led side edged past defending champions Mumbai Indians in the tournament opener before getting the better of Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders to jump to the top of the points table.

On the other hand, the Royals have managed to win only one of their three fixtures. They lost to Chennai Super Kings in their previous match to slip down to the sixth spot. Sanju Samson and his men will be eyeing a second win.

The Royals have struggled to perform as a cohesive batting unit. While Samson led the team to within touching distance of victory with his sensational century against Punjab Kings, it was the South African duo of David Miller and Chris Morris that pulled off a win against the Delhi Capitals.

Against CSK, opener Jos Buttler looked dangerous but the other batsmen failed to provide any valuable contributions. For the former champions to do well, the side must click as a batting unit with Samson and the Englishman playing key roles.

The Royals bowling unit has been underwhelming to say the least, apart from the game against Delhi Capitals, the bowlers have leaked runs. Pacer Jaydev Unadkat shone against the Rishabh Pant led-side, registering the impressive figures of 3/15, while young Chetan Sakariya has shown promise.

In the absence of Jofra Archer, more will be expected out of the likes of Chris Morris and Bangladesh speedster Mustafizur Rahman.

For RCB, Ab de Villiers and new-recruit Glenn Maxwell have been the standout players with the willow. While the South African continues to deliver season after season, the Australian all-rounder is proving to be a valuable addition to the middle order.

Kohli has got decent starts in a couple of games but the talismanic skipper will be itching to play a big innings. Young Devdutt Padikkal, who impressed everyone last season, has also looked rusty and is yet to perform to his full potential. After two failures Rajat Patidar will, too, look to make amends.

The RCB bowling department has been impressive with pacers Harshal Patel and Mohammed Siraj boasting economy rate of of 5.75 and 5.81 respectively. The former pulled the rabbit out of the hat with a five-wicket haul against MI while left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (3/7) changed the complexion of the match in just one over against the Sunrisers.

In an interesting move RCB played only three foreigners instead of four in the game against KKR. It will be interesting to see if they go for a similar playing XI or get in the likes of leg-spinner Adam Zampa, pacer Kane Richardson or experienced all-rounder Daniel Christian, who hasn’t impressed with the bat or ball, back into the team.

Washington made his Test debut earlier this year against Australia in Brisbane.

He scored a fluent 62 and snared three wickets in the first innings. In the second essay, he played a game-changing 22 on the final day to help India seal a memorable victory.

“I think performing well in the Test cricket definitely boosts a lot of confidence for any cricketer,” Washington said at the virtual product launch of the “Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro.”

“And getting to play Test cricket at the highest level for the Indian cricket team, which has been really doing well, especially in the last few years is a dream come true moment for any youngster and that has happened to me,” he added.

The 21-year-old was also a part of the Indian Test side that defeated England 3-1 last month.

“We played against two top quality sides — Australia and England. Performing against them and winning games against them gave me a lot of confidence and self belief.

“So, yes that confidence I will definitely take it forward and also the momentum I would really love to take forward throughout the IPL and the games to come,” he added.

Talking about the IPL, which is being held behind closed doors for a second successive edition, Washington said: “It has been two years now. The last IPL was also played behind closed doors.

“I think we are very much used to it, though we would love to have a lot of crowd supporting us and I know the kind of energy crowds bring in for every game is amazing.

Fan groups confronted the players in the early hours of Wednesday morning when the team returned from its 1-0 away loss at Bielefeld which confirmed Schalke would drop out of German soccer’s top tier for the first time in 30 years.

“During this encounter, so far unidentified individual people from the crowd crossed lines which FC Schalke 04 considers non-negotiable,” the club said.

Schalke’s players, including Sead Kolasinac (on loan from Arsenal) & Shkodran Mustafi, had to flee from an angry mob of fans last night after their 1-0 loss away to Arminia Bielefeld confirmed their relegation to the 2.Bundesliga.

Schalke added that it understood the anger but “the club will never accept the physical welfare of its players and staff being endangered. That is exactly what happened last night due to the actions of individuals.”

Police in Schalke’s home city of Gelsenkirchen said up to 600 people, some with pyrotechnics, gathered at the club’s stadium to await the team’s return. When the team left the bus, “the players had eggs thrown at them and were verbally attacked.” Police said they intervened to stop the incident escalating further. There was no immediate report of arrests but police are still investigating. No injuries were reported.

Relegation follows a dramatic decline for Schalke, which played in the Champions League knockout stages two seasons before. The club is in deep financial trouble and has won only two Bundesliga games all season.","LIVE NOW

If the league takes off how will it change club football?

A) It will change for the worse; B) Not much will change and C) Too early to say.

The critics of the Super League have called the endeavour ""greedy"". Do you agree with that assessment that this is just about money?

Should the domestic competitions like

EPL

, La Liga etc. axe the teams who are part of the Super League?

Would it be fair if players who take part in the Super League are banned from playing in the World Cup and Euros?

News of 12 of the biggest and most powerful football clubs in Europe unveiling the plan to launch a breakaway European Super League sent shockwaves across the global football fraternity. The football world is currently a divided one.The proposed ESL lost a lot of steam recently though when all six English clubs who were initially part of the project ( Manchester United , Manchester City, Chelsea , Liverpool , Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur ) pulled out, dealing a body blow to the new venture. However there seems to be a long legal battle on the horizon, with the ESL writing to both FIFA and UEFA to say that they are taking legal steps to protect their venture.TimesofIndia.com ran a poll to ask the fans to give their opinion on five questions related to the European Super League. Majority of fans who voted polled to say that they are not in favour of the proposed league.The first question that was asked was -Out of a total of 5472 votes that were polled, 3508 votes were polled for the 'no' option, while the 'yes' option received 1964 votes. The majority of the fans are clearly not in favour of the proposed league.The second question that was asked was -The three options given here were -Not surprisingly, the most number of votes were polled for option A. The ""It will change for the worse"" option received 2769 votes, the ""Too early to say"" option received the second most votes, with 1821, while 883 votes were cast to say that ""Not much will change""The third question asked as part of this poll was -Again, it wasn't a surprise to see as many as 4108 votes being polled for the ""Yes"" option, while the no option received merely 1341 votes. This is a clear indication that most fans feel that the main motivator for the clubs to come together to try and form a breakaway Super League is revenue generation and that received a thumbs down from the fans.The fourth question that was asked was -This was of course before the six EPL teams withdrew from the ESL. The fans seemed to be torn on this one, with 2887 votes being polled to say that the clubs should be removed from their domestic competitions, while 2551 votes were polled by fans who felt that such a harsh step should not be taken.The English clubs, who were initially part of the project put up statements on social media early Wednesday morning India time stating that they are pulling out of the ESL. And it was predominantly the fans' voices and their shock and anger that made the clubs change their minds.Arsenal FC tweeted to say - As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League.We made a mistake, and we apologise for it.The fifth and final question that was asked was -This was being talked about as a possible sanction by UEFA and FIFA. And once again the fans sided with the players, echoing the sentiment that the players should not be punished for the decision taken by club executives.As many as 3464 votes were polled for the ""No"" option here, as opposed to 1976 votes being cast for the ""Yes"" option.The fans clearly feel that it would be unfair for the world bodies to sanction the players and ban them from representing their countries.","Read the full article

(File Pic- Getty Images)

MADRID: Atletico Madrid's players have expressed their ""satisfaction"" at the club's decision to withdraw from the European Super League project on Wednesday.

""From the Atletico squad we want to communicate our satisfaction over the final decision to withdraw the commitment to the Super League project taken by our club,"" a statement by captain Koke said on Twitter.

""We will keep fighting to help from our position so that Atleti grow with the values of effort and sporting merit that have always characterised us, so that all of you continue to feel reflected in that identity. We will continue working hard, focused on the match tomorrow.""

Atletico became the lastest club to pull out of the huge controversial competition on Wednesday, with the project on the brink of collapse.

Only Real Madrid and Barcelona officially remain, after England's 'Big Six' teams were the first to quit, before the Italian trio Inter Milan , Juventus and AC Milan followed suit.

Atletico said in a statement earlier on Wednesday the decision to join had been made ""in response to circumstances that no longer exist today"".

The club added the ""first team squad and coach have shown their satisfaction with the club's decision, understanding that sporting merits must prevail over any other criteria.""

Atletico were one of three La Liga sides involved in the breakaway tournament, with Real Madrid and their president Florentino Perez at the heart of the project.

Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman said in a press conference on Wednesday: ""I spoke with the president [Joan Laporta] yesterday and he explained the club's position.

""But a lot has changed since then. It's best not to say much now, no one knows what will happen. There were teams that were in; now they say they don't want to be in. What I want most is the best for this club.""

","MILAN: Italy's AC Milan , Inter Milan and Juventus on Wednesday followed all six English clubs as well as Atletico Madrid in giving up on the European Super League (ESL) while continuing to push for a change in world football.

Italian champions Juventus, whose president Andrea Agnelli was one of the driving forces behind the ill-fated project, said the withdrawal of most of the 12 founding teams made the plan unworkable.

""(Juventus) believe that at present there are limited chances that the project be completed in the form originally conceived,"" the Turin club said.

They added that they were ""convinced of the soundness of the project's sport, commercial and legal premises"".

In an interview given before the English clubs' withdrawal, Agnelli had insisted the breakaway league would go ahead.

""Between our clubs, there is a blood pact, we will move forward. (The project) has a 100 percent chance of success,"" Agnelli told La Repubblica

""Football is no longer a game but an industrial sector and it needs stability.""

Juventus pointed out that despite ""the request and intentions otherwise expressed by certain clubs to withdraw from this project ... the necessary procedures envisaged by the agreement among the clubs have not been completed.""

Shares in Juventus plunged by more than 12 percent on Wednesday, having reached their highest level since September on the announcement of the project.

Like Juventus, AC Milan did not formally withdraw but said they were bowing to a backlash from fans around the world.

""The voices and the concerns of fans around the world have clearly been expressed about the Super League, and AC Milan must be sensitive to the voice of those who love this wonderful sport,"" said the seven-time European champions.

The club, owned by US-investment fund Elliot, added: ""Change is not always easy, but evolution is necessary for progress, and the structures of European football have evolved and changed over the decades.

""We will continue to work hard to deliver a sustainable model for football.""

Chinese-owned Inter Milan confirmed they were ""no longer part of the Super League project"".

""Inter believes that football, like every sector of activity, must have an interest in constantly improving its competitions, to keep on exciting fans of all ages around the world, within a framework of financial sustainability.""

Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid officially remain the only teams left in the project three days after its launch.

STUTTGART (Germany): Former world number ones Karolona Pliskova and Angelique Kerber came through their first-round matches in Stuttgart on Wednesday with differing experiences as both played their first clay-court matches this season.

Pliskova, 29, had to dig deep after losing the second set to German Tamara Korpatsch before sealing a 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 victory.

The Czech Republic star, currently ninth in the world, admitted struggling before setting up a second-round match against Latvia's Jelena Ostapenko on Thursday.

""I'm super happy that I'm through, but other than that I didn't see many really good things,"" said Pliskova.

""I was struggling a bit in the rally. I thought there were too many errors from easy balls, but my serve was quite ok.

""First rounds are always a bit nervous, especially a first match on clay.

""I'm just going to hope it's going to be better.""

Pliskova is on course to meet world number one Ashleigh Barty of Australia in the quarter-finals on Friday.

Barty, the top seed, makes her first appearance later against former Stuttgart champion Laura Siegemund in their second round tie.

Earlier, three-time Grand Slam winner Kerber breezed into the second round, sweeping aside Georgia's Ekaterine Gorgodze in a 6-2, 6-2 victory.

""That wasn't a bad way to start the clay-court season, she wasn't an easy opponent and I had a solid game,"" said Germany's Kerber.

The 33-year-old, who has dropped to 26 in the world rankings, expects a ""tough match"" on Thursday against fourth-seed Ukranian Elina Svitolina, who has won all of their last six meetings.

MADRID: Fiery Italian Fabio Fognini was defaulted from the Barcelona ATP tournament on Wednesday for verbally abusing a line judge.

The 33-year-old was trailing world number 147 Bernabe Zapata Miralles 6-0, 4-4 when he clashed with the official and was defaulted by the umpire for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Fognini is one of only a small number of players to have been defaulted from a match.

The most famous incident involved world number one Novak Djokovic who was disqualified from the 2020 US Open for hitting a line judge with a ball.

Nick Kyrgios was also defaulted at the Rome tournament in 2019 after hurling a chair onto the court.

Fognini, the world number 27, is no stranger to being disqualified.

At the 2017 US Open, he was booted out of the tournament and fined $24,000 for a series of insults aimed at a female chair umpire.

VIENNA: Dominic Thiem is struggling with pandemic-related ""emptiness"", but plans to return to the clay-court in Madrid in early May once a knee pain dissipates, he told an Austrian newspaper Monday.

After winning the US Open against Alexander Zverev in September, Thiem said he was full of ""euphoria"", but ""in preparing for this season, I fell into a hole.""

""There is a certain emptiness, though it's not dramatic. Last week, I didn't even watch the football Champions League because it's such a tragedy,"" he said, adding that he ""barely followed"" the tennis tournament in Monte Carlo, which he had decided to sit out.

The world number four spoke of the mental strain of the pandemic in an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Standard published on Monday.

He said that while rivals such as Daniel Evans or Alexander Bublik may thrive without distractions, he suffers with the restrictions on movement during quarantines and the empty stadiums

""It was extreme in Dubai,"" he said. ""We were locked in, while outside life was normal. You were allowed to leave the hotel at 9 pm and enter an empty stadium. That's not great,"" Thiem said of his last match in March in Dubai, where he lost to Lloyd Harris.

The 27-year-old said that the primary reason he pulled out of the Miami Open, the Monte Carlo Masters and a tournament in Belgrade was a ""small issue with my left knee,"" that would quickly heal.

""If you aren't 100 percent fit, you've already lost,"" he said, referring to his defeat in the last 16 of the Australian Open in February and early exits in both Doha and Dubai.

He said he decided that it would be ""smarter to sit it out. You shall only come back when it makes sense.""

Thiem is a two-time runner-up at Roland Garros , the second major of the year which is due to begin May 24, and said that he dreams of winning a medal at the Olympic Games in Tokyo scheduled for this summer, ""if they take place.""

BENGALURU: The recent performance against reigning Olympic champions Argentina shows that the Indian team is in good shape going into the Tokyo Games, feels young forward Shilanand Lakra .

India won both their FIH Pro League fixtures in Argentina and two of the four practice matches, with Shilanand finishing the tour with a goal in the final practice game.

""I think we played very good hockey against Olympic Champions Argentina. Our recent performances shows that we are in good shape going into a big event like the Olympics,"" he said in a release issued by Hockey India on Monday.

""Right now, though, our focus is only on the FIH Pro League games against Great Britain next month.""

Despite being one of the younger players in the Indian men's hockey team, Shilanand held his own in Argentina, and is happy to have contributed whenever opportunities came his way.

""Having made my debut for the senior team three years ago, I'd have expected myself to play more but that is how competitive it is; there are so many amazing players in the core probables group,"" he said.

""My aim has always been to earn a place in the team through consistent performances in domestic tournaments, national camps and whenever I play for India - as a starter or a substitute.""

The 21-year-old said the long break due to COVID-19 pandemic helped him and credited chief coach Graham Reid for improving his game.

""To be out of competitive action for so long...it gave me the time to re-think and analyse my performances, and also prepare for the highs and lows in the months ahead,"" he said.

""I am also constantly in touch with the coaching staff, especially chief coach Graham Reid, who has helped me improve on my game immensely.""

Shilanand also hailed the contribution of Amit Rohidas and senior pro Birendra Lakra -- the two other players from Odisha -- who are also his teammates in the senior team.

""I think both of them have been exceptional and I get so much inspiration when I speak to them. They have always been given me sound advice,"" he said.

""I turned to them whenever my morale was low over the past two years and it helps a young player like me to see two other players from Odisha make it big in Indian hockey.""

The 42-year-old from Kolkata shot a final round of two-under 70 after rounds of 72-68-73 to finish T-15 at Austrian Open.

""I have been playing well off and on. In India on the PGTI I had some good results including Tied-3rd at Gujarat and Tied-4th at Tata Steel Tour Championships in December. But on European Tour things did not come together,"" Chawrasia said.

""Though I was in the fray at halfway stage, the third round pulled me back, but I was happy to fight back on the final nine on the final day.""

Chawrasia's previous Top-20 in Europe was T-18 in Made in Denmark in May 2019.

""I am playing in Spain next couple of weeks and I have always loved Spain and I have good friends. A couple of good results and I am sure the confidence will become better,"" he said.

John Catlin of the United States won his third European Tour title in eight months and 13 starts as he overcame Max Kieffer on the fifth play-off hole on a dramatic final day. Catlin also moved into the Top-25 of Race to Dubai and reached inside 80th in world rankings.

The European Tour will be in Spain for next three weeks for the Gran Canaria Open, Tenerife Open and Tenerife Championship. Then its British Masters hosted by Danny Willett and after the PGA Championship it will be Made In Denmark.

","Arjun Atwal. (Photo by Luke Walker/Getty Images)

NEW ORLEANS: India's Arjun Atwal plans to produce some ""awesome golf"" as he partners Thai star Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans at TPC Louisiana beginning on Thursday.

The 48-year-old Atwal feels the duo has the ability to surprise top teams with their golf at the $7.4 million PGA TOUR showpiece.

The event sees 80 two-man teams slugging it out under a different format, with Four-Ball being used in the first and third rounds and Foursomes (alternate shot) in the second and final rounds.

Jon Rahm and Ryan Palmer will defend the title they won in 2019. The event was not held last year due to COVID-19. Other leading teams will be Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay, Matt Wolff and Collin Morikawa, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith, Tony Finau and Cameron Champ and Sungjae Im and Byeong Hun An.

Atwal has always been impressed by Kiradech, who was in the Asian team at EurAsia Cup, which he captained. This time around it was Kiradech who picked Atwal.

Both are former Asian No. 1s and have won a combined seven European Tour victories between them.

""There's nothing to not like about Kiradech. He's such a cool guy, and he's laid back just like me. We recently played a few rounds together and I realised how similar his game is to mine, at least during my peak,"" Atwal said.

""I know he's struggled a little bit over the last few weeks but I think he's found his form and I think you'll be seeing some awesome golf from us.""

Kiradech has failed to find his best form for nearly two years now, missing six cuts in 10 starts in the current season which have left him in danger of losing his PGA TOUR card. He hopes that partnering one of Asia's golf legends will provide the missing spark.

""The reason why I picked Arjun is because he's one of the best Asian players ever. He's won on the Asian Tour, European Tour and PGA TOUR and there's no doubt in my mind why I picked him.

""He's also such a nice guy, a very positive guy and I'm looking forward to playing alongside him. We're very comfortable with each other and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of fun,"" said the 31-year-old Thai.

Both Asian stars are competing for the first time in the tournament under this new team format, although Kiradech will lean on his more experienced partner who finished fifth at TPC Louisiana in 2005 when it was played as an individual strokeplay event.

""I've had some success on this golf course. I was leading and had a mishap in the third round but I like the course and I'm loving it that I get to play with Kiradech,"" said Atwal.

""I asked Kiradech if he was interested in partnering and he said 'yes' as he thinks I'm good luck. Our style is pretty similar ... he can hit a fade at will and I can hit a draw at will. So that works for us and we will strategize.

""Our short game is pretty similar too but his is actually fantastic. I think we will have a great week. One thing I know for sure is that we'll have a lot of fun playing together.""

Kiradech thinks a change to the team format will do him wonders as he seeks to improve on his current 183rd ranking on the FedExCup points list.

The Top-125 at the end of the Regular Season in August keep their cards and also qualify for the lucrative FedExCup Playoffs.

""I just need someone to trust in me and believe in me and the right role model is Arjun. It'll be a pleasure to play with him and I want to thank him for spending time with me,"" Kiradech said.

""I've not set a target that we need to do well or need to win as we just want to enjoy ourselves. I'm sure this week will be one of the best times in my golf career.""

KOLKATA: In their quest to win an Olympic medal, India's star doubles players Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty are adding a 'Plan B' to their strategy by incorporating a tactical European style of play under new coach Mathias Boe .

The world number 10 Indian duo played its first tournament under Boe at the All-England Open last month but bowed out after losing to Denmark's Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen in the second round.

""We were trying to play a new style of game. We may not have played our best but we played a game which was a lot more tactical, different style of play,"" Shetty said during a virtual media interaction organised by SAI in the build-up to Tokyo Olympics.

""If we really need to go for a shot at the medal we need to have a Plan B in place.""

Asked whether adjusting to the European style of play would affect their Olympic preparation, Shetty said: ""Getting used to a new coach and a different kind of setup is a challenge. But both of us are at a level where we can play all kinds of games.""

""It's just that we need some kind of tactical improvement in our game. We can defend, we can attack. We just need a few corrections here and there.""

His partner Rankireddy also hailed the new coach and said there's been a lot of positivity since the appointment of the London Olympics silver medalist in January.

""The second team is playing really good. Definitely, there are a lot of changes from the previous coach. We have a European style of game now. Previously we had many Asian coaches. It's been a little difficult for us to change our style of play but there have been a lot of positives, working really well.""

The duo's next challenge would be the India Open from May 11-16, an event that will be held behind closed doors due to the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's very difficult to play without spectators at home. I was expecting family people would come, many were willing to come and support us but in this situation, it's better to play in a bio-bubble. We are looking forward to it and aiming for a podium finish.""

Concerned about the recent 'false positive' test for COVID-19, they said they are awaiting to get vaccinated before heading off to Tokyo in July.

Recently, HS Prannoy was forced to pull out of the Thailand Open after he had returned a 'false positive' test for COVID-19.

""It's disturbing with the false reports coming in. So definitely we will take the vaccine and go. We are looking for government permission,"" Rankireddy said.

""With the second wave coming, we definitely want to get vaccinated, whenever we get an approval,"" his partner Shetty added.

","MADRID: All Spanish athletes competing at this year's Tokyo Olympics will be vaccinated against COVID-19 before heading to the Games, the President of Spain's National Council for Sports Jose Manuel Franco said on Wednesday.""There's absolute certainty that our sportsmen are going to be vaccinated in a timely manner and correctly, with all guarantees, and of course they will go to the games with all necessary sanitary guarantees,"" Franco said.He said the authorities were looking to cause the least disruption possible in administering the vaccinations, which may mean they are carried out at athletes' homes rather than the Spanish Olympic Committee headquarters in Madrid.","NEW DELHI: Indian swimmer Likhit Selvaraj on Wednesday alleged that the timings were ""manipulated"" during the recent Uzbekistan Open Championships to ensure Olympics qualification of local participants and called for a probe into the matter by world body FINA.In a video uploaded on YouTube, he even went to the extent of saying that the organisers of the April 13-17 Olympic qualifying event in Tashkent tried to bribe him when he protested.""It was quite sad and heart-breaking to see a lot of manipulation of timings in favour of few Uzbekistan swimmers which also resulted in wrong times being recorded for the Indian swimmers,"" he said in the video.""I request all the other swimmers to come out and FINA to launch an investigation and take action against the necessary person or swimmers who are involved in this.""The 22-year-old reigning national champion Selvaraj had won silver medals in the 50m and 100m breaststroke events in Tashkent.He is close to achieving the Olympics B qualification time of 1:01.72 in 100m breaststroke. His personal best in the event was 1:02.02.He pointed out that the 100m freestyle heats on the opening day and the 100m butterfly heats on the final day needed to be looked at by FINA. He uploaded the videos of the heats and final race.""It started off with 100m freestyle on Day 1 where Aleksey Tarasenko (of Uzbekistan) who swam 51 seconds in the heats, but his time was changed to 48.55 and given the 'A' cut for the Olympics. They did not display the time on the board. They had shut it off,"" he said.He claimed the same thing was repeated on the last day and the display board was again shut down during the 100m butterfly event and the organisers did not share the timings of the Indians.""In the 100m butterfly heats, Sajan Prakash finished first in the heats with a time of 54 seconds. We checked the time manually because the results were not showing. But once the results came out, it was quite shocking. Tarasenko was given first with a time of 52.02 and Sajan 52.74.""The other Indian swimmer in the event, D Adithya, who had clocked 56.43 in the Karnataka State Championships in early March, was credited with a flattering time of 53.45 seconds, also matching the 'B' Standard for Olympic qualification.""The times of top 8 swimmers were manipulated,"" Selvaraj said.He said he protested by not taking part in his event even though he went up to the blocks.""I had my 200m breaststroke final on the last day. Seeing all this didn't make me want to swim. Instead, I went on the blocks and when the start was given, I never jumped in, I never dived in for my twin breaststroke finals.""Instead, I just froze on the blocks for the next 2 minutes and 5 seconds. After that, I came down, I touched the touchpad and stopped my own time, asked the officials if it was the new world record to show them that what they were doing was wrong and I just left the pool,"" he said.Selvaraj said he was followed by the officials and the organisers and he told them they were cheating.""They told me 'you don't understand the politics, we have been given instructions from higher authorities to send 10 Olympic A cuts from Uzbekistan'.""They tried to bribe me with a lot of money to keep my mouth shut. I declined. Later, they were begging me not to put this out there.""Few minutes later they came back to me, they demanded a letter from my side which has to state that I was mentally unstable and I was deaf, so I could not hear the start when they gave the buzzer go in the 200m breaststroke.""","Julian Alaphilippe.

CHARLEROI (Belgium): World champion Julian Alaphilippe won the Fleche Wallonne cycling classic in Belgium on Wednesday after reeling in Slovenia's Primoz Roglic on the final 1.3km climb that hits gradients of more than 19 per cent.

The Frenchman, who also claimed victory in 2018 and 2019, sat up at the line and wagged a finger after his impressive late comeback.

Roglic attacked near the bottom of the final Mur de Huey climb and only Alaphilippe and Alejandro Valverde were able to follow, as the Spaniard finished third, six seconds down.

British rookie Tom Pidcock finished 6th, some 11 seconds down.

There were 12 categorised climbs and another dozen hills on the 193.6km run from Charleroi to the steep finish at the Mur de Huy climb.

The actor, currently seen hosting Colors reality show Dance Deewane 3, took to Instagram to share his Covid-19 diagnosis. “After experiencing fever and cough, I have just tested positive for COVID.

Until early April, Raghav was shooting for Dance Deewane 3 alongside Madhuri Dixit, Dharmesh Yelande and Tushar Kalia. But as Covid-19 cases began to peak in Maharashtra, the government prohibited film and TV shoots in the state for 15 days till May 1. The curfew, however, didn’t affect Dance Deewane 3 as the makers had a bank of episodes to last the period.

The poem, the epilogue of which Nakuul posted on Monday, has gone viral as several of his fans and friends believe it resonates with the helplessness they have been feeling amid the second wave of Covid-19 that has left the country devastated.

Sharing an excerpt from the poem on Instagram, Nakuul penned a long post describing his intentions behind the commentary. He wrote, “There is so much one has felt in the last fortnight which we all are still processing… Fear, anger, desperation, helplessness and much more. Whilst all of us can look within and reflect on how we could gave played this differently, and sure we could have. There needs to be self accountability for the mess we are in but the general apathy shown to us by people who govern us, who have let nothing come in between their mad hunger to strengthen their vote bank whilst the citizenry has been left to his or her own devices to figure this once in a lifetime situation we are in. That there has been lack of foresight & preparation is not even debatable.”

The Mirzapur star on Wednesday composed a Twitter thread, advising fans on various Do’s and Don’ts based on his understanding.

The actor first reiterated what every doctor has been saying since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic- “Please wear your masks.” Fazal also said that people should not wait for help from government authorities, rather look out for one another. “STEP 1- Please wear your masks everyone. We are all on our own now and for each other . What I’ve gathered is – the system helps speed up the panic. Stay vigilant. Calm your nerves most importantly, don’t wait for sarkari help. The lack in planning is going to jam the machinery…”

Medicines are running low. From what i gather Medrol and Mucinac are majorly in demand. And short on supply. This data is from lucknow. I dunno abt others. Oxygen needs constant refilling . Meanwhile , apply for your vaccines. ( follow step 1 again) most importantly DO NOT PANIC. — Ali Fazal M / میر علی فضل / अली (@alifazal9) April 21, 2021

One of the important pleas that Ali Fazal made to his followers was to not hoard medical equipment. Several places in the country are reporting acute shortage of medicines that are required to treat Covid-19 patients. He further wrote, “Do not hoard. Because that is a mentality, not a solution. Stop yourself. Remember how our mothers budgeted for us? And taught us ? Yes. Apply that NOW. We do this together , we win this together. Our govt needs our help, not our money or the votes. That they have. So lets help.”

On a certain level, I was looking forward to this film. I was creatively sure that you are right for the film,” adding that to an outsider, Kajol’s personality can appear ‘aggressive, brash and harsh’. He said it is only after working with her that he realised that it is a part of her nature but she doesn’t mean to hurt or throw attitude. He jokingly added that he sure was disappointed with her sense of humour.

Aamir, who got married at the age of 21, also spoke about his relationship with ex-wife Reena Dutta. “I don’t have regrets about my life at all.

Rakulpreet Singh said, “The photo in the video is from the day when my father took me for my first swimming session. As I shared the photo with the Netflix team for this video, I realised how earlier these photo albums meant so much to us. Now, our memories are just lost in the gallery of our mobile phones.”

Neena Gupta is excited to know the audience’s reaction to her character of a grandmother. “This is a heartwarming story filled with lots of emotions and laughter. It’s the perfect family watch as you embark on a journey with my grandson as he fights all odds to fulfill my last wish. This is the first time I am playing a character like this one and I am excited to see how the audience reacts to it,” Neena Gupta said in a statement.

For Arjun, signing on Sardar Ka Grandson was the perfect opportunity to work with a talented, experienced cast. “Working alongside such a talented ensemble cast was an enriching experience for me. We are hoping that the story will resonate with people across the globe with the raw & real emotions that it shows through a loving grandmother-son relationship,” he said in a statement.

Sardar Ka Grandson was shot last year amid the pandemic. The film was originally scheduled to hit the theaters but producer Bhushan Kumar decided for a digital release since he believed, “the film should reach the audience for whom it is made. The medium doesn’t matter.”

Sardar Ka Grandson is produced by Emmay Entertainment, John Abraham Entertainment and T-Series.","Abhishek Bachchan recalled the times when his father Amitabh Bachchan was going through really rough time, financially. (Photo: Abhishek Bachchan/Instagram)

The way Amitabh Bachchan resurrected his career after his company Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited went bankrupt is one of those affirmative and inspiring stories which are a part of movie folklore. While the actor himself has spoken about his struggle at the time earlier, now son Abhishek Bachchan has remembered those days.

“Well, truth be told, I left university — I was studying in Boston University. I had declared my major as liberal arts, and then I majored in performing arts. And I left my education because my father was going through this really rough time, financially. He had started this business called ABCL,” Abhishek said in YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia’s podcast.

He said he started as a production boy. “I don’t think I was qualified to help him in any which way, but I just felt that as a son, I needed to be around my father, and help in whatever way. So I left my college and came back. I started helping him in his company.” He said his father called him to his study late at night to tell him about the financial situation. Amitabh apparently told him that ‘movies aren’t working out, the business isn’t working out, nothing is working out’.

The rest, as they say, is history. In an interview a few years ago, Amitabh had said, “There was a sword hanging on my head all the time. I spent many sleepless nights. One day, I got up early in the morning and went directly to Yash Chopraji and told him that I was bankrupt. I had no films. My house and a small property in New Delhi were attached. Yashji listened coolly and then offered me a role in his film Mohabattein. I then started doing commercials, television and films. And I am happy to say today that I have repaid my entire debt of Rs 90 crore and am starting afresh.”","There might be a temporary shut down at the movies due to the coronavirus pandemic, but superstar Akshay Kumar has made sure he treats his fans with back-to-back projects once theatres resume, and it’s relatively safer to step out. One of the busiest actors in the country, Akshay has as many as six films waiting to hit theatres. While some of these movies have finished filming, some are still under production.

The actor’s Sooryavanshi, which has been waiting to release since March 2020, should be his first film to hit theatres in 2021. Akshay also has Bell Bottom, Atrangi Re, Prithviraj, Raksha Bandhan and Ram Setu in his kitty.

Here’s a list of Akshay Kumar’s upcoming films:

But the coronavirus-induced lockdown delayed its release. When theatres were allowed to resume operations from October 15, fans hoped Sooryavanshi would arrive on the big screen soon, but the makers waited for theatres to operate at 100 per cent occupancy across the country. Finally, in March this year, Akshay and the team announced the film’s release date – April 30, and it was reported that the cast would launch nationwide physical promotions in early April. All the plans, however, were thwarted by the surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, forcing the government to shut down theatres in the state till April 30. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png While announcing the postponement, the makers issued a statement, saying, “The Honorable Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Mr Uddhav Thackeray had a discussion with director Rohit Shetty yesterday. In the meeting, Mr Uddhav Thackeray appreciated Rohit Shetty as he took the brave and difficult decision of postponing Sooryavanshi owing to the current COVID situation in the state.”

Bell Bottom

The multi-starrer actioner had a start to finish schedule in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic last year. The team finished filming in October 2020. Earlier, there were reports that the film would arrive on an OTT platform, but the producers later announced that they would release it theatrically. With the second wave of Covid-19 continuing to peak in the country, it’s not certain whether Bell Bottom will release in theatres on May 28. While announcing the film’s wrap up, Akshay had expressed his gratitude towards his team members for shooting amid the pandemic. He said, “It is teamwork and I am grateful to each and every member of the cast and crew from the spot dadas to the light dadas to the technicians to the make-up dadas to my lovely heroines Vaani, Lara, Huma, my director Ranjit and to Vashuji and the production team who believed in our audacious plan. The new normal has made us realise a different way of working that none of us could have imagined. I hope this encourages film industries globally to do what they do best and start entertaining audiences again. I hope our shoot during the pandemic reassures others that keeping all safety in mind, it’s time to get things moving again.”

This drama, which revolves around the brother-sister bond, marks the second collaboration between Akshay Kumar and Anand L Rai. Raksha Bandha was announced last year. Akshay has said the film is his tribute to his sister Alka Bhatia and also to the brother-sister relationship.

This period film will see Akshay Kumar in the role of 12th-century Indian monarch Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan. Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar will make her big screen debut Prithviraj. She will play Prithviraj’s wife Sanyogita. This is Akshay’s first historical drama. Prithviraj was announced in September 2019. At that time, the cast had said the film would arrive in theatres on Diwali 2020, but the filming was delayed due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. Akshay, Manushi and the team resumed shooting at Mumbai’s Yash Raj Studios in the second half of 2020.

Ram Setu

The journey of making one of the most special films for me begins today. #RamSetu shooting begins! Playing an archaeologist in the film. Would love to hear your thoughts on the look? It always matters to me🙏🏻 @Asli_Jacqueline@Nushrratt@Abundantia_Ent@LycaProductions pic.twitter.com/beI6p0hO0I — Akshay Kumar (@akshaykumar) March 30, 2021

Akshay Kumar has described Ram Setu as a “bridge between generations past, present and future”. The actor plays an archaeologist in the film. Amazon Prime Video, which is co-producing the action-adventure drama, said Ram Setu’s story is rooted in “Indian culture and historical heritage.” Akshay, Nushrratt and Jacqueline began filming Ram Setu last month in Goregaon Film City, before the superstar, along with 45 crew members, tested positive for Covid-19 and the shoot had to be halted. Akshay was also admitted to a city hospital for treatment. As shoots in Maharashtra have been prohibited due to spike in Covid-19 cases, it’s not certain when the Ram Setu team would begin shooting.","Kannada actor Darshan’s latest film Roberrt will start streaming on Amazon Prime Video from April 25. The film released on March 11 to packed houses across Karnataka. And despite the prevailing concerns of coronavirus at the time, the film managed to draw crowds in huge numbers. And the government’s permission to fill up 100 per cent seats at cinema halls boosted the film’s performance at the box office.

According to reports, the film earned more than Rs 40 crore within three days of its initial release.

Roberrt is written and directed by Tharun Sudhir, who made his mark earlier with Chowka (2017). The film follows a man who is trying to turn over a new leaf by leaving behind his violent past. “Roberrt is an out and out action drama featuring audiences’ favourite Darshan. His phenomenal performance has been the biggest plus point for the film. Roberrt has an interesting plot that will keep the audiences at the edge of their seats. The transition of our protagonist from Raghva to Roberrt is a visual delight to watch. Moreover, having Darshan as the protagonist and with his nation-wide fan base, I knew the film would be a crowd puller,” said Tharun Sudhir.

Roberrt also stars Jagapathi Babu, Ravi Kishan, Vinod Prabhakar and debutant Asha Bhat. “While the plot of the film will keep the audience engaged, my character in the film will be an interesting one to watch. It will give the viewers a chance to see me in different avatars – that of a gangster, a faithful friend and a good father,” said Darshan.","James Gunn is known for directing Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

Director James Gunn says he has completed The Suicide Squad, including VFX and all the post-production work. The film is still months away for release but the director is looking forward to fans’ reaction. The movie releases on August 6 in theatres and HBO MAX.

“By the way – we completely finished the Warner Bros movie this week, VFX and all. Can’t wait for you all to see it,” he tweeted.

When a user asked whether it was unusual to have finished the film this long before a release, Gunn said they could achieve that because they did not have any reshoots. “Yes, it is unusual, but I always planned to have it done by now. What’s more unusual is that we didn’t do a single shot of pickups or any post production shooting. Outside of Chris Nolan, that almost never happens, if at all, on tentpole superhero films,” the director said.

The Guardians of the Galaxy director also said that he had full control over how he shaped the DC’s villain team.

“Yes, the movie is mine from start to finish,” he said.



With tentpole movies, studios usually like to control things, which has led to issues in the past.

Gunn said with the movie finished, he is now looking at “marketing & toys, doing publicity and waiting for the world to heal just a little more so a larger number of people can see it safely in theaters, where it is intended to be seen.”","Actor-dancer Shantanu Maheshwari has tested positive for the coronavirus.

The actor is said to be making his Bollywood debut opposite Alia Bhatt in Gangubai Kathiawadi.

Apart from Shantanu, several celebrities from the film and television world have tested positive for Covid-19. The list includes names like Akshay Kumar, Sonu Sood, Vicky Kaushal, Bhumi Pednekar, among others. To curb the spread of the virus, various state governments have imposed night curfews and temporary lockdowns. All shoots in Maharashtra have also been halted during the 15-day lockdown leading to most television shows packing off to other cities to carry on the workflow. The central government in its recent announcement has also announced that everyone above the age of 18 would be vaccinated starting May 1.","A Twitter squabble has erupted between Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut and comedian Saloni Gaur as the former laid out her opinions about the laws for population control in India.

Several other Bollywood celebrities, who have been sharing pictures from their vacations on social media, are being reprimanded for their thoughtless behaviour. Shruti Haasan also felt it is irresponsible of the actors to share photos of their exotic holidays.

In a recent interview with The Quint, Shruti said, “Glad they had a great holiday, they deserved it. I did not personally feel it was a time to go maskless in a pool. It has been a tough time for everyone and for some people much more. I think gratitude and being thankful for privileges is what is most important to know versus throwing your privileges in people’s faces.”

On the work front, Varun Dhawan is currently shooting for his next, Bhediya along with Kriti Sanon. The film is directed by Amar Kaushik.","After its first season revolving around love, heartbreak and treachery, Out of Love is back with a new chapter, promising an even more thrilling and engaging story. Starring Rasika Dugal and Purab Kohli as Meera and Akarsh, the Oni Sen directorial will premiere on Disney+ Hotstar on April 30.

On Tuesday, the makers released the trailer of Out of Love 2 which gives a glimpse into Meera and Akarsh’s relationship. The new season will chronicle Meera’s life, three years after she found out about her husband’s affair, and left him with a tarnished reputation, a failed business, and a broken relationship with his son Abhi. And now, Akarsh will head back to Coonoor and re-enter Meera’s life with the sole purpose of seeking revenge. In the trailer, the audience also gets to see Akarsh trying his best ti snatch Abhi from Meera. The estranged couple will go to unexpected levels to hurt each other, leaving one seeking answer to ‘how much revenge is enough revenge?’

Commenting on the new season, Rasika Dugal in a statement shared, “People deal with betrayal in different ways and this season dives into the feeling of revenge. For me it was an opportunity to explore Meera Kapoor further and delve into her unpredictability. I am eager to see how audiences respond to this season.”

Calling Out of Love 2 a psychological warfare, Purab Kohli added, “Manipulation is second nature to Akarsh’s character and he is willing to go to any lengths in destroying Meera. The level of tension between the characters and intense moments fuelled by several plot twists will keep the viewers guessing till the very end.”

The director Oni Sen further shared that Out of Love in its first season was essentially about infidelity and betrayal, however, season 2’s narrative would unfold many more layers of depth. He added that the characters are manipulative and desperate to destroy each other, making it an engaging story to watch.

Produced by Sameer Gogate and BBC Studios, Out of Love 2 also stars Meenakshi Chaudhary, Sanghmitra Hitaishi, Harsh Chhaya, Ekavali Khanna, Suhaas Ahuja, Kabir among others.","Salman Khan-starrer Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai is the first Hindi film to simultaneously release on multiple platforms.

Speaking on the subject, Shariq Patel, CBO, Zee Studios shared, “The ongoing pandemic forced us to innovate, and we are proud to be the first to embark upon this new distribution strategy.

There cannot be a better film than Radhe to offer the audiences who’ve been waiting for an out and out entertainer for over a year now.

What have you learned?’ Some people have learned to cook, some have picked up a new hobby, language, new skill set. I feel very overwhelmed, and I was speaking to my wife about it. And as all wives do, they put your lives into focus, they put you back on track. She said yeah but put it this way for the first time in your life you got to spend the entire year with your family.

Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) Special Zonal Committee (SZC) member Muttannagari Jalandhar Reddy alias Maranna alias Karuna, who surrendered before Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang on Tuesday, said there were no recruitments in the CPI (Maoist) for the last few years.

The Maoist leader, who had served in various capacities in the banned outfit for more than two decades, said the strength of the party had been dwindling by the day.

“The main problem being faced by the Maoists is recruitments. The party is facing several other problems too. Being a senior leader in the party, I had disagreed with some issues and decided to join the mainstream,” Maranna told The Hindu.

“As the local Adivasis are unwilling to join the movement, the Maoists are recruiting tribal people from Chhattisgarh. The Maoists have no support of the Adivasis in many hamlets now,” said Mr. Sawang.

On the back foot

“Due to the changed scenario in the cut-off area in the AOB, the Naxalites are facing difficulty in reviving the movement. With the A.P. and Odisha police launching joint operations, the Maoists are on the back foot,” the DGP said.

According to the figures available with police, the cadre strength of the Maoist, which was about 170 in the AOB earlier, has come down to 80 now. The number of area committees, which was eight earlier, has come down to four. The People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), which once had two companies, has only one now. The two divisional committees in the AOB have only one platoon. “This clearly shows the cadre problem in the Maoist party,” Mr. Sawang said.

Sharing the data of the arrests and surrenders in the last two years, the DGP said eight Exchanges of Fires had taken place in which eight Naxalites were killed. Six Maoists, who included one SZC member, one divisional committee member, and an area committee member, were arrested.

Many people in the district have complained that they are having to wait for four-five days to get the results after giving their samples for the COVD test.

During a factcheck by The Hindu based on complaints from people, it came to light that there was a shortage of digital entry operators at the GGH Out Patient COVID-triage centre in the city. The Government General Hospital at Anantapur runs a 24X7 sample collection centre with 500 to 800 persons giving their samples every day.

‘Backlog’

A couple of persons, who had given their samples on April 15(Thursday), had come on Tuesday to the GGH asking for the result as they had not received any SMS either of their sample getting accepted or the result. The data entry operators said only one person was working per shift and that there was a backlog.

“My worry is I had a journey scheduled for Tuesday and did not get my result or certificate even after two days of giving the sample,” said V.K. Rinas, who was supposed to go to Kerala for Ramzan. Kerala government is insisting on getting a COVID-negative certificate for entry into the State. There were at least half a dozen people arguing with the staff at the counter demanding their test results.

When asked, District Medical and Health Officer Y. Kameswara Prasad said that all the Urban Health Centres in Anantapur and PHCs in the rural areas were collecting COVID samples and entering data there itself.

Hospital Superintendent K.S.S. Venkateswara Rao told The Hindu that it had now allocated 15 staff members for the data entry and got the entire backlog cleared. It may be noted that the district has a capacity to test 6,000 samples a day, but less than 4,000 samples were collected from all over the district during the past 20 days in April. In March, less than 3,000 samples were collected.","1,652 test positive while 10 succumb to COVID in South Coastal Andhra

Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Tuesday said that the Vice-Chancellors of universities in the State should take up awareness campaigns on COVID-19 in a mission mode.

In a video-conference he held with the Vice-Chancellors, the Governor informed that in view of the alarming situation in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reviewed the pandemic situation with the Chief Ministers and Governors in two separate meetings, where he had stressed the need for implementation of a five-fold strategy – Testing, Tracing, Treatment, COVID-Appropriate Behaviour and Vaccination, and called for a united fight against the pandemic.

He said the pandemic posed a serious challenge to the institutions of higher education and the role of the Vice-Chancellors was crucial in putting in place effective measures for safety of the students and staff, without compromising on the academics.

Besides, they also had a larger responsibility to create awareness among the public on the protective and preventive aspects by utilising the services of the NCC and NSS cadre.

The Governor said students should educate their parents and people in their neighbourhood on the importance of using mask, maintaining physical distance and frequent handwash. They should visit at least five houses every day and take up community surveillance. He said the 10 best performing colleges in each district and three best universities in the State would be suitably rewarded for their work.

He said students had the power to reach out to society and create awareness, and appealed to them to come forward and take up the fight against the virus.

Mr. Harichandan said the State was in second position in terms of conducting COVID-19 tests during the first wave, and this time, it was much ahead in terms of testing, tracing and treatment in the country.

The Governor appealed to all sections of society to extend their cooperation to the government in controlling the spread of the pandemic.

Education Minister A. Suresh said people should avoid the three ‘Cs’ – Closed environment, Crowded places and Contact with others, while the three ‘Ts’ – Testing, Tracing and Treatment – should be adopted effectively to contain the spread of the virus.

Special Chief Secretary, Department of Education Satish Chandra, Secretary to the Governor Mukesh Kumar Meena, and Chairman, AP State Council of Higher Education, K. Hemachandra Reddy, attended the programme.","Vigilance officials nab staff of a private hospital for ‘diverting Remdesivir stock’ into black-market

A private hospital in the city refused to admit an elderly woman, who had tested positive for COVID-19, on the plea of ‘lack of beds’. Three other private hospitals also declined admission. There are allegations of some private hospitals are trying to make hay while the sun shines.

The staff of a private hospital were reportedly caught when they were allegedly trying to shift Remdesivir stock from the hospital for sale in the black-market. They were caught in a vigilance raid, on Monday.

“My father, is an ex-serviceman, and hence my mother is eligible for reimbursement of medical bills but they declined,” says Anita Rao, an artist, who tried to admit her mother into a private hospital.

Her 28-year-old son had also tested positive for COVID-19 and she is attending to him at home. She went around four private hospitals but she could not get a bed.

There were no COVID beds at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) also and she finally managed to get a bed for her mother at the King George Hospital (KGH).

“At least five staff members are required to attend to meet the needs of patients in each ward at the COVID block in KGH. The bathrooms are, no doubt, dirty but going by the number of patients undergoing treatment at the CSR Block and shortage of cleaning staff, one cannot blame them,” says A. Chandrasekhar of Purushottapuram area, who underwent treatment at KGH two weeks ago.

“The services of doctors and staff are excellent in the COVID ward, but there was lack of coordination among the staff and monitoring by the higher authorities. The washrooms were stinking with no cleaning for four to five days. Though there are CC cameras, there is no monitoring. More doctors should be appointed and monitoring of ICU is essential,” he says. A total of 6,775 beds, including some in the private hospitals, have been allocated for COVID-19 patients in the district, District Medical and Health Officer P. Suryanarayana said on Tuesday. “There is no shortage of oxygen and 62,000 doses of vaccine have arrived and they will meet the requirements of all frontline and health care workers in the district. An additional 10 lakh doses will be required for the general public,” he added.

Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao had announced on Monday that 6,568 beds are available for COVID-19 patients in the district. District Collector V. Vinay Chand said that six private hospitals in ‘A’ category and 33 hospitals in ‘B’ category have been notified in the district.","Several people complain that they are unable to get the second jab

The second wave of COVID -19 is raging through the State and the district, and at this juncture, the district is facing an acute shortage of vaccines and due to deficiency of reagents the numbers of tests per day also have been reduced.

In this month so far, the district has recorded over 6,700 cases, averaging over 350 cases per day. The second wave is now full blown and on an average about 20% of the tests are turning out to be positives, said district COVID Special Officer and Principal of Andhra Medical College P.V. Sudhakar. At this juncture, when the only panacea is said to be mass inoculation, the programme is hit by shortage of doses.

The most importantly, it is affecting those who are awaiting the second jab.

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior professor from Andhra University College of Engineering said that he was due for the second jab on April 17, but was turned down from at least seven private hospitals, as there was no stock. Forced to reach the DMHO, he was informed by the officials that only frontline workers were being vaccinated and was told to call the State help desk Spandana.

“When I called Spandana, I was told to contact 104. And the response from 104 was to register in the Cowin App, wherein I will be indicated where I can get vaccinated, but unfortunately the App has no such indication,” he said.

The same was the case with six persons, who contacted this correspondent in the last two days over the same issue, and a former professor from AU alleged that the vaccination planning has gone wrong. “They are running short of vaccines, as the Union government has failed to provide the State its requirement, and the State has failed to branch the stock under ‘first’ and ‘second’ dose category. Forced with the scenario to vaccinate more numbers, they missed the ‘second dose’ demand,” said the former professor.

Meanwhile, as the second wave is sweeping the district, getting tested has become a worrisome factor. Almost all private hospitals and diagnostic centres have stopped conducting tests and have hung ‘no test’ boards, stating that there is a shortage of reagents. The tests are only being done in limited numbers at government facilities.

Sources say that since infection rate is around 20% in the community, more number of tests will show a higher figure.

From averaging around 6,000 tests per day, it is learnt that the testes are brought down to 3,500 to 4,000 per day.Meanwhile, admitting that the second wave is raging and the virus is more virulent, the district administration has said it was ready to handle an outbreak.

They claimed that around 6,500 beds in Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), King George Hospital (KGH) and Government Hospital for Chest and Communicable Diseases (GHCCD), are kept ready, with at least 2,000 with oxygen facility and a number of private hospitals have been notified to function as category A and B COVID hospitals. Officials also said that efforts are on to see that the tests go up and added that vaccination depends on supplies from the Union government.","The presiding deity is seen in a yogic posture

The temple dedicated to Lord Rama at Peddaputha village in Valluru mandal is unique in its own right. Apart from its architectural grandeur, the temple, dating to the Vijayanagara period in 1400 CE, has the idol of the presiding deity seated in a yogic posture, which is a rarity.

The idols of Lord Rama carrying bow and arrow is common. However, the idol in this temple does not have these weapons. The Lord is seen sitting in ‘Padmasana’, with his right hand in ‘Chinmudra’.

In yoga, ‘Chinmudra’ is considered as a posture in which the practitioner holds the hand close to heart, palm closed, thumb and forefinger brought together. The left hand of the idol is seen touching the ground in ‘Bhumisparsha mudra’.

Goddess Sita sits to the left of Lord Rama, holding a lotus; while Lord Lakshmana, carrying his bow and arrows, stands to the right of the presiding deity.

Lord Anjaneya is seen sitting in front of the Lord Rama in reading posture, referring to the ‘Brahma Sutra’ inscribed on palm leaves.

“The idols symbolically show that Lord Rama is keenly listening to the Vedic recital by Lord Hanuman,” explains V. Ramabrahmam, an academician at the Department of History and Archaeology of the Yogi Vemana University, Kadapa.

Similar iconography can be found in Singanamala in Anantapur district and also at the 500-year-old temple at Nedungunam, 24 km south of Vandavasi town on Kanchipuram-Chetput route in Tamil Nadu, at the foot of Dheergajala mountain.

Dilapidated condition

Yet, the temple at Peddaputha village is in ruins and hardly known to people. The shrine used to be in a dilapidated condition for over three decades, but after its takeover by the Endowments Department last month, a glimmer of hope has emerged among the devout as well as the archaeologists that it would be revived.

“This is not enough. The State or Central archaeology departments should consider taking over this temple for preservation,” says Mr. Ramabrahmam.","Action will be taken if the orders are violated, says Collector

"The civic body has issued notices to 66 private hospitals in the city asking them to reserve half of their beds for COVID-19 patients under the government quota.

These hospitals include reputed chains like Apollo Hospitals, Fortis Hospitals, M.S. Ramaiah, Narayana Health, among others.

Gaurav Gupta, Chief Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), told presspersons that with every passing day more beds in the city were being brought under the central bed allocation system of the government, claiming the 50% quota in private hospitals. “We started with 4,300 beds a few days ago and have now gone up to 7,000 beds.

A joint statement released by MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag, MUDA Commissioner D.B. Natesh and Deputy Director of Department of Libraries Manjunath B. said the construction will be carried out by Nirmithi Kendra.

The officials said they had not sought donations from the public for constructing the library, but decided to open an exclusive bank account and keep the donations which were being raised from the public for the sake of transparency and accountability.

The three departments were individually as well as jointly financially stable enough to take up the work.

The bank account had so far collected ₹9,124 as at 12.30 p.m. on April 20 and a decision on how the amount is to be utilised will be taken at a meeting of the City Central Library Authority’s Sub-Committee constituted for the construction of the library.

Donors wishing to contribute to the library have been asked to preferably donate books, furniture, computers and other essential items instead of money.

The joint statement by the officials also clarified that there is no compulsion on the amount collected through online crowdfunding to be deposited into the bank account opened by the authorities.

The amount raised through crowdfunding can also be used for buying any items for the library or be deposited in any Central government scheme or bank deposit scheme for payment of monthly honorarium to Syed Ishaq, whose original library was burnt down.

With the Union government allowing all adults to get vaccinated from May 1, the State government is preparing to increase its capacity to store, deliver and administer vaccine doses.

For large districts such as Belagavi, this means a 10-fold increase in logistics arrangements.

When the Centre fixed the age limit for people to receive the vaccine at 60, the State government fixed a target of 4.4 lakh in the district. But if all adults are to be vaccinated, then the district administration will have to provide vaccine shots to 35 lakh people.

Health Department officers say that this is a tall order, as this would be the largest vaccination drive ever taken up in the district. “The biggest vaccination drive till now has been Pulse Polio when around 16 lakh children were vaccinated. The current target would be double that number. We need to work on storage, transport and delivery,’’ a senior health officer said.

“As of now, we have 228 vaccination centres across the district. They include 200 government facilities and 28 private hospitals. This means we have one vaccination centre for two gram panchayats. But if we are to vaccinate every adult, we need four vaccination centres for every gram panchayat. We need to set up temporary vaccination centres in primary health centres or the gram panchayats,’’ another officer said.

“The most important factor is maintaining the cold chain. In many of the 506 gram panchayats, there is no 24-hour power supply. This means the vaccine will be rendered ineffective. We need temporary power back-up or other arrangements,” he added.

On Wednesday, Regional Commissioner Amlan Aditya Biswas and Deputy Commissioner K. Harish Kumar held a meeting with officers on increasing the rate of tests. They also spoke of increasing the capacity of vaccination in a phased manner. Another series of meetings is lined up this week to prepare for mass vaccination from May 1, Mr. Kumar said.","Re-activates COVID-19 Enforcement Teams for implementing the new set of guidelines announced by State government

With the State government bringing in stricter rules for controlling the resurgent COVID-19, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Wednesday said it will get tough with those flouting the norms and warned of booking criminal cases against repeat offenders.

“We are going to be strict against those not wearing masks, not maintaining social distance and violating other safety precautions. They will be penalised and booked if they continue to disobey the rules,” warned MCC Commissioner Shilpa Nag.

After going around the market and commercial areas here along with Deputy Commissioner of Police Geetha Prasanna for spreading awareness on the need for wearing face masks and following the rules, Ms. Nag said the Health Department had alerted that the cases would continue to spike for the next 20 days and therefore the public have to cooperate in tackling the crisis by complying with the rules.

Testing and vaccination had been stepped up to fight the pandemic, she said and added that the MCC would lay emphasis on enforcing COVID-19 rules for the next one week, putting off all other works and meetings.

COVID-19 teams re-activated

Ms. Nag said the COVID-19 Enforcement Teams had been re-activated in nine MCC zones and nine testing teams had been formed in the zones which will be overseen by the zonal commissioners.

As many as 150 booth-level officers (BLOs) had been appointed for enforcing quarantine and home isolation rules. Each ward will have two such officers who will be verifying the status of the patients and ensure they do not step out of their homes.

26 micro-containment zones

Ms. Nag said 26 micro-containment zones had been created in the city based on the positive cases. This is unlike the containment zones and barricading of the areas done last year since only the home where the positive cases are detected would be contained for controlling the spread.

War rooms

The MCC has constituted three COVID-19 War Rooms in Narasimharaja, Krishnaraja and Chamaraja constituencies and they are in addition to the District COVID-19 War Room run by the district administration. Ten BLOs will manage each war room.

Replying to questions, Ms. Nag said the importance of wearing masks was yet to sink in among many in the city. “We have started the raid and will enforce the mask rule strictly. The public have to cooperate; otherwise we shall be slapping fines every time they violate the rule,” she warned.

Police help

Teams comprising officers from the MCC and the city police have been constituted to enforce the rules, including the number of people allowed to participate in a wedding event. “The Commissioner of Police has provided us 15 officers to assist us in enforcing the rules strictly,” she replied.

The MCC has collected a fine of ₹94,000 from those not wearing face masks.

MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj and other officers from the MCC were present when the MCC conducted the mask awareness drive.","People urged to extend cooperation to contain the spread of pandemic

Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said here on Wednesday that a majority of new COVID-19 cases being reported in the district are from the city and its surroundings.

Addressing presspersons, he said: “About 90% cases being reported in Dakshina Kannada are from Mangaluru and Bantwal areas. Of those cases, 90% of cases again are from Mangaluru City Corporation area.”

Asking people to cooperate to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Deputy Commissioner said that there is no shortage of vaccines in the district which received 20,000 doses of Covishield and 2,000 doses of Covaxin on Wednesday.

He said that in case of death of COVID-19 patients in the city, their cremation cost will be borne by the Mangaluru City Corporation. Cremation will be free in Boluru, Nandigudda and Surathkal. In addition, the district administration has identified five acres at Badaka Ekkar village for burial of bodies irrespective of the religion of the dead.

The district administration has identified ESI Hospital in the city, NITK buildings in Surathkal, hostels of Morarji Desai Schools and Mangaluru University for converting them as COVID care centres when needed.

Dr. Rajendra said that the district administration has ₹15 crore in its kitty for COVID-19 management activities. It has appointed 25 nodal officers to co-ordinate with hospitals and patients and their families to address issues relating to COVID-19 treatment.

He said that the district administration will come out with a system of announcing availability of hospital beds in the public domain after a week. At present, 3,500 beds are available in hospitals across the district.

The Deputy Commissioner said that the district has 10 laboratories conducting RT-PCR test for COVID-19. These laboratories give reports on positive cases within 36 hours. It will be ensured in the coming days that they also give negative reports within 36 hours.

In all, 31 major hospitals in the district now provided treatment for COVID-19 patients. The district is conducting 5,000 sample tests (RT-PCR) daily.

The COVID-19 positivity rate in the district now stood at 5.60% and the case fatality rate was at 1.92%, the Deputy Commissioner said.

Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar and others were present.","Five women farm workers who were travelling in a three-wheeler were killed after their vehicle collided with a cement-mixer truck near Kolur village in Shahapur taluk, Yadgir district, on Wednesday. Five more workers who were critically injured were rushed to the Shahapur taluk hospital.

The deceased were identified as Devindramma (57), Ayyamma (45), Sharanamma (35), Umadevi (40) and Kashimbhi (55).

The injured are Mallamma (36), Sharanagouda (28), Hampamma (25), Bhagyashree (14) and Gangamma (38).

All of them, from Manamatagi village, were on their way to Huvina Hedagi village of Deodurg taluk in Raichur district for agricultural work.

The cement-mixer truck was heading towards Shahapur when the accident occurred. The truck driver is said to have escaped from the scene soon after the accident.

Responding to a video clip that showed the kith and kin of a patient appealing to the staff at Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences (BRIMS) to treat their patient on the hospital floor itself, if there were no beds available, Bidar Deputy Commissioner Ramachandran R. said that there was no scarcity of beds in the district.

Speaking to media representatives on Wednesday, he said that the video was made with ill-intention and deliberately made viral.

“Some people who claimed to be members of an NGO are creating a rumour that there was no bed available for new patients in the district. The fact, however, is that there is no dearth in beds. We have 450 beds in the old hospital and another 100 beds in the new hospital. We will initiate legal action against those who are spreading misinformation and misleading the people,” he said, appealing to the people not to pay heed to rumours and fake news.

To a question, Mr. Ramachandran said that BRIMS was a dedicated COVID-19 hospital and not a COVID-19 care centre and only those COVID-19 patients who needed hospitalisation would be admitted there.

“There are 50 beds available in Aurad and another 28 beds in Humnabad taluk hospitals. Serious COVID-19 cases are admitted to BRIMS and others are sent to other hospitals where beds are available,” he said.","He will be anointed on May 14 at Sode Vadiraj Mutt in Sirsi taluk

Udupi Sode Vadiraj Mutt on Wednesday announced 16-year-old Aniruddha Saralatthaya as successor to Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha Swamiji of Udupi Shirur Mutt, who passed away on July 19, 2018. Saralatthaya will ascend the seat as the 31st seer on May 14 at Sode Mutt in Sirsi, Uttara Kannada.

Sode Mutt, the dwandva mutt of Shirur Mutt, was entrusted with the responsibility of selecting the seer for the latter as Late Lakshmivara Tirtha had not appointed any successor. Sode Mutt seer Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha told reporters at Shirur Mula Mutt near Udupi that appointing a teenager as heir to Ashta Mutts in Udupi was a tradition followed as per the recommendations of the Shastras.

Saralatthaya, son of Uday Kumar Saralatthaya and Srividya from Nidle village near Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada, has studied the Vedas, Tatparya Nirnaya and Yuktamallika, a magnum opus by Sode Mutt founder Sri Vadiraja Tirtha Swamiji. He would ably take up the new responsibility and undertake further studies in Vedanta and may continue his formal education through informal mode of education, Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said.

Having undergone formal education till Class 10, Saralatthaya will be ordained into Sanyasa between 7.35 a.m. and 8 a.m. on May 13, followed by his anointment as the seer of Shirur Mutt the next day between 12.35 p.m. and 12.50 p.m., Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said.

Saralatthaya, who was present, said that he chose to walk the path of renunciation as he felt worshipping Lord Krishna was a task that gives him ultimate content.

His ancestors served as priests of Sri Durga Parameshwari Temple, Kadya, near Kukke Subrahmanya. His father came to Udupi in 1988 for higher studies. He later pursued B.Ed, and Ph.D, at the National Sanskrit University, Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh.

Regarding objections to the anointment by some followers of Late Sri Lakshmivara Tirtha, Sri Vishwavallabha Tirtha said that those objecting were not related to the affairs of the dwandva mutts, Sode and Shirur, and hence, he would not make any comment.","The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the State government to ensure that the local authorities and the police department take action against those who park motor vehicles on footpaths as the law prohibits parking on footpaths and prescribes penal actions for such violations.

Observing that the obstruction caused by such parking amounts to violation of fundamental right of the citizens, the court said the police should initiate penal action against persons who park vehicles on footpaths, under the relevant provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, the Indian Penal Code and the Karnataka Traffic Control Act, 1960.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions while disposing of a petition filed by 68-year-old D.S. Ramachandra Reddy, a city-based advocate.

The petitioner had questioned regular parking of vehicles on footpaths in a particular locality and the authorities had taken action against illegal parking after inspection report by the District Legal Services Authority has found illegal parking on footpaths.

The Bench also directed the government to issue necessary communication to the police and other authorities informing them about the direction of the court to effectively implement the laws that prescribe penal action for parking vehicles on footpaths.","Night curfew, weekend lockdown became inevitable as they took norms lightly: Deputy Commissioner

Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Nitesh Patil has said that medical emergencies such as COVID-19 could not be handled effectively without the support of and cooperation from the general public.

Speaking to presspersons in Dharwad on Wednesday, Mr. Patil said that the decision on night curfew and weekend lockdown became inevitable as the people developed a casual approach towards standard operating procedure despite the risk to their lives.

The Deputy Commissioner said that if people failed to mend their ways and ignored the protocol again, the situation could turn from bad to worse forcing the administration to take further stringent steps.

Briefing presspersons about the regulations that would come into force on Wednesday night, he said that tough measures were being taken and restrictions imposed to break the infection chain.

Closure

Mr. Patil said that as per the Government Order, all shops and business establishments, excluding pharmacies, should be closed by 9 p.m. for the day. The order will be in force till May 4 in the twin cities and all taluks of the district.

During the weekend lockdown, no shops would be allowed to open barring those connected to essential services and people should refrain from venturing out as prohibitory orders will be in force, he said.

As per the order all educational institutions, coaching centres, cinemas, gymnasiums, swimming pools, cultural and religious auditoriums, clubs will remain closed till May 4. Apart from banning all kinds of social and political gatherings, closure of places of worship has been ordered, he said.

Already hotels, bar and restaurants have stopped serving food on their premises. They have been allowed to hand out parcels, instead. However, hotels with lodging facility have been allowed to serve food only for room occupants. Those violating the protocol will be dealt with strictly which might lead to sealing premises, he said and added that at roadside inns and dabhas on highways only parcel services are allowed.

Mr. Patil clarified that essential businesses such as provision shops, pharmacies, meat and fish shops along with construction material shops will be allowed to operate and there will be no hindrance to construction activities and industries.

With the government allowing only 50 persons for marriage ceremonies, a special team has been formed to keep an eye on marriage halls and cases will be registered against organisers if the number exceeded the limit. Special bands with names on them will be issued to only 50 persons each attending marriages, he said.

To a query, Mr. Patil said that they have already begun taking action against violators. “We have booked cases against three bar and restaurants and a jewellery shop for violating the guidelines and hefty fine has been imposed,” he said.","13,640 positive cases in Bengaluru

Amidst the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases in Mysuru, Minister in-charge of Mysuru district S.T. Somashekar on Wednesday visited the checkpost at Bavali on the Karnataka-Kerala border and reviewed the steps taken by the district administration and the police for controlling the spread of the contagion.

Anybody from the neighbouring State wishing to travel to the State through Bavali has to produce a RT-PCR negative report which has been made mandatory by the State government.

At Bavali, a COVID-19 Inspection Centre and Border Facilitation Centre has come up.

Mr. Somashekar, after the inspection, said the travellers not possessing the RT-PCR negative report are being sent back.

The Minister, however, admitted that the number of vehicles from Kerala entering the State through Bavali has dropped over the COVID-19 scare and the restrictions. As many as 120-130 vehicles are passing through the border daily fulfilling the norms.

Mr. Somashekar said the Kerala government has set up a swab collection centre at the border to facilitate the travellers of its State for getting the tests done. This centre has started to function from Tuesday. “Steps will be taken on our side too.”

Claiming that steps had been taken for the smooth movement of goods from Mysuru to Kerala, especially farm produce, through Bavali, he said the administration had responded to emergency situations and facilitated the movement without any difficulties.

He told reporters that the tough rules for bringing the resurgent pandemic under control have come into effect in addition to the night curfew and the weekend curfew across the State. These rules have to be complied with strictly and the Mysuru district administration will be enforcing these rules firmly.

“I am confident that the people of Mysuru will follow the COVID-19 Appropriate Behaviour as the city has less number of violations of COVID-19 norms,” he said.

In reply to a question, Mr. Somashekar said there was no shortage of Remdesivir injection for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in government hospitals but the private hospitals were facing scarcity of the drug. In this connection, the Minister for Health is visiting Mysuru on Thursday and look into the matter, he said, adding that 5.70 lakh vaccine doses had been administered in Mysuru district out of the targeted 8.75 lakh doses.

He reiterated that Mysuru is also not facing any shortfall of medical oxygen.

H.D. Kote MLA Anil Chikkamadu, Mysuru Superintendent of Police C.B. Rhyshanth, revenue and health officials were present.","Taking note of the severe shortfall of oxygen cylinders at health facilities across the country after the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases, oxygen producers operating from Jindal’s steel plant at Toranagal in Ballari district have considerably increased liquid oxygen production.

As per information provided by sources in the steel plant, four oxygen producing companies, including Linde Gas India (earlier called Praxair), BOC India Limited and Industrial Gases Private Limited that supply gases, including oxygen, required for making steel to JSW, have already increased production of liquid medical oxygen to meet the growing demand.

“Normally, these four companies together produce between 120 tonnes and 150 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen a day and supply it to various hospitals. Last July [when COVID-19 was widespread], the production of liquid medical oxygen in the JSW plant rose to 200 tonnes a day and reached 430 tonnes a day by September. Now, we are back to the same sort of situation. In the first week of April this year, production was around 130 tonnes and now, it has increased to 350 tonnes a day,” a JSW official told The Hindu.

He added that production was expected to be further increased to over 400 tonnes a day in the days to come.

The companies are supplying medical oxygen to various hospitals in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and other States as per requirement. It is learnt that production of medical oxygen in these plants is being monitored by high-level officers in the Union government after oxygen shortfall in hospitals became a serious issue.

Meanwhile, officials involved in medical oxygen production say that the problem cannot be solved by increasing production of medical oxygen alone. “Transportation and storage infrastructure for oxygen after it is produced is also equally crucial. It requires tankers, cylinders and storage infrastructure also,” they said.

“State-level meetings are regularly being held on the issue and JSW authorities are also participating in them,” Ballari Deputy Commissioner Pavan Kumar Malapati has said.","Hassan Deputy Commissioner R. Girish has said the district administration had sufficient supply of medical oxygen and Remdesivir vials necessary for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

Speaking to presspersons in Hassan on Wednesday, the officer said the government hospitals and Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences had no shortage of the vials. However, the private hospitals had problems in procuring the vials. A few people had called him over the shortage in supply. “I have spoken to the officers concerned. It will be addressed. The HIMS would get daily 13 kilolitres of medical oxygen. Besides that an oxygen plant had been functioning in Hassan”, he said.

The district administration, he said, was prepared to impose night curfew and weekend curfew as per the guidelines issued by the Chief Secretary. There would be no movement of private vehicles, except those delivering essential services and goods carriers, during the curfew. During the weekend curfew, the shops selling vegetables, milk, groceries and meat would be allowed in the morning hours.

Fresh cases

As many as 467 fresh cases of COVID-19 were reported in Hassan on Wednesday. Four people died of the infection, increasing the total tally to 508. So far 33,143 have been infected and among them, 30,111 have recovered. Among 2,524 active cases, 24 are in the intensive care unit of HIMS.

A health inspector of Hassan CMC, on Tuesday, slapped the fine for not keeping a sanitiser bottle.

During the rounds in the market, a team of officers noticed a vegetable seller not keeping the sanitiser. The seller said he would keep do so if the administration had given him one. This led to a heated argument between the sellers and the officers. At one point, a health inspector tried to snatch the seller’s balance scale. The officer demanded a penalty of ₹500.

The vegetable seller maintained that he had hardly made business since the morning and he could not afford to pay the fine. The officer said that if he did not pay the fine on the spot, his shop would be lifted from the market. The vegetable seller paid the fine, probably with the help of his friends in the market. A video clip of the incident has gone viral in the city. Many people have expressed their anger over the officer’s conduct.

When this issue was brought to the notice of Deputy Commissioner R. Girish, he said keeping a sanitiser bottle was compulsory for establishments, not vegetable sellers in the market. “I will talk to the officer who slapped fine on the vegetable seller”, he said. Further, he added that the public had to cooperate with the administration in its efforts to avoid the spread of the infection.","They want to know how officials allowed encroachment of public land

“How did officials allow encroachment of public land for a library?”. This was an ‘inconvenient’ question raised by a group of citizen activists in Mysuru more than 10 days after a library set up by 62-year-old Syed Ishaq in Rajiv Nagar was destroyed in a fire.

The activists including Bhamy V. Shenoy and six others have written a letter to Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner and marked a copy to Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) Commissioner regretting the failure of the officials to take action when Mr. Ishaq started a library on a Civic Amenities (CA) site belonging to the MUDA.

Though the group of citizens described Mr Ishaq’s “noble goal of giving easy access to books and newspapers to readers in Rajiv Nagar” as “most admirable”, they said it was “most unfortunate” that nobody has raised the ‘inconvenient’ question so far.

“When we first read his story in the media, our initial reaction was how did the officials allow an encroachment on public land. However, as we learnt more – like an illiterate starting a library, tiny shed having 11,000 books, spending ₹8,000 per month to support the library despite his limited wage earnings, support for promoting Kannada books, having hundreds of books like Bhagavad Gita, Bible and Quran etc, our emotions took over. Some of us even wrote a letter suggesting that we need to raise funds (we were not aware of the crowd funding then) to help him”, the letter said.

However, the letter said the episode took a different turn with politicians, Ministers, officials coming forward to compete with one another to get involved. “Even at the risk of being misunderstood, some of us, who have taken a principled stand against various encroachments in the past, want to raise a fundamental question”.

The letter referred to their earlier campaigns against encroachment or violation of law during the construction of a building in Cheluvamba Park, a library in People’s Park, besides other residential buildings or shops.

“During the long years since 2011 when Mr. Ishaq started the library in a CA site belonging to MUDA, why did the officials fail to take action? Even now when we all know that Mr. Ishaq has violated the rule of law, what is the right thing to do? Just ignore the illegality as we seem to be doing”, the letter asked.

“…Should we just forget the encroachment even when done with the noble motive?”, the letter said while referring to the rampant violation of law that also includes “misallocation and misuse of CA sites….”.

Apart from Mr. Shenoy, the letter had also been signed by C.R. Aswathanarayan, Shoba Sambasivan, Venkatesh Kharidi, Roy Joseph, Nanjapur Yaduraju and Usha Yaduraju.

However, speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Shenoy clarified that they were not opposed to the construction of a permanent library building in the spot in Rajiv Nagar by the government agencies after due allocation of land for the purpose.

The public hearing to elicit objections to felling of trees in front of Lalitha Mahal Palace, and slated to be held on April 23, has been postponed in view of the COVID-19 situation.

The public hearing scheduled to be held at the Aranya Bhavan from 11 a.m. now stands postponed indefinitely in view of the restrictions imposed on public gathering owing to the surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the Deputy Conservator of Forest (Territorial), Prashanth Kumar.

Nearly 150 trees were marked for felling on a four-acre land to pave way for a helipad as part of the heli-tourism project against which there was public opposition. An online campaign launched to save the trees elicited nearly 70,000 signatures and even politicians belonging to the ruling BJP voiced their resentment over tree-felling and the heli-tourism project.

The issue snowballed into further controversy as the erstwhile royal Pramoda Devi Wadiyar staked claim over the land proposed for the helipad and cited a court ruling in her favour. This put a question mark on the legal tenability of the project pushed hard by the Minister for Tourism C.P. Yogeshwar.","Deputy Commissioner K.V. Rajendra said here on Wednesday that those who have arranged marriages during the weekend lockdown (Saturday and Sunday) will have to get the list of guests attending the marriages approved by respective local urban local bodies and gram panchayats.

Addressing presspersons along with Police Commissioner N. Shashi Kumar, he said that no other passes need to be obtained for those guests attending the marriages. Only a maximum of 50 persons will be allowed to attend a marriage ceremony.

Guests travelling to marriage venues during the lockdown days should show the police and other government authorities at the check-posts the list containing their names along with the marriage invitation card and their identity proof (such as Aadhaar card). If there is no hard copy of the invitation card, its image and the image of the list approved by the urban local body or the gram panchayat containing their names received on WhatsApp can be used for the purpose, Dr. Rajendra said.

The Police Commissioner said that each traveller’s name should be there in the list approved and each traveller should individually show their identity proof. In case of hiring services of a driver to go to a marriage, such travellers will also be allowed to travel.

Mr. Kumar said that people can purchase essential commodities between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. They should purchase them in their locality. If anybody misused the relaxation given by travelling without valid reason during the given period, action will be taken against such people.","It also directs govt. to ensure regular payment of pension

The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the State government to ensure that all aged pensioners, who cannot physically attend the public offices to comply with procedures, should be paid pension under various schemes in view of the prevailing situation owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Court also directed the government to ensure priority for senior citizens in utilising medical facilities under Section 20 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (MWPSC) Act, 2007 at COVID Care Centres and hospitals designated for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj issued the directions while hearing a PIL petition filed by the Akhila Karnataka Vyyovrudhara Okkoota, an organisation working for the welfare of the elderly in the State.

The Bench also directed the State government to give effect to the apex court’s August 2020 direction that all old people who are eligible for pension should be regularly paid pension and those identified should be provided necessary medicines, masks, sanitizers and other essential goods by the respective States during pandemic.

As the MWPSC Act specifies priority to be given to senior citizens in government hospitals or hospitals fully or partially funded by the government, the Bench directed the government to issue necessary advisories to the authorities concerned to give effect to the provisions of this law.","After 15 days, employees of the Road Transport Corporations called off the State-wide bus strike on Wednesday evening. At a press conference, honorary president of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employees League Kodihalli Chandrashekar said the strike has been called off after the Karnataka High Court order.

This will come as a huge relief to bus passengers who had to rely on other modes of transport since the strike began on April 7.

On Tuesday, while hearing a batch of PIL litigations, the High Court had observed that it was perhaps the “worst time” for employees to strike even if the demands are assumed to be legitimate.

A new study from the Centre for Neuroscience (CNS) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) explores how well deep neural networks compare to the human brain when it comes to visual perception.

According to an IISc release, deep neural networks are machine learning systems inspired by the network of brain cells or neurons in the human brain, which can be trained to perform specific tasks and have played a pivotal role in helping scientists understand how our brains perceive the things that we see. Despite having evolved significantly over the past decade, they are still nowhere close to performing as well as the human brain in perceiving visual cues, it said.

Deep networks work differently from the human brain. “While complex computation is trivial for them, certain tasks that are relatively easy for humans can be difficult for these networks to complete,” it said.

In the recent study, published in Nature Communications, S.P. Arun, Associate Professor at CNS, and his team have compared various qualitative properties of these deep networks with those of the human brain. The team studied 13 different perceptual effects and uncovered previously unknown qualitative differences between deep networks and the human brain.

“An example is the Thatcher effect, a phenomenon where humans find it easier to recognise local feature changes in an upright image, but this becomes difficult when the image is flipped upside-down. Deep networks trained to recognise upright faces showed a Thatcher effect when compared with networks trained to recognise objects. Another visual property of the human brain, called mirror confusion, was tested on these networks. To humans, mirror reflections along the vertical axis appear more similar than those along the horizontal axis,” explained the release.

The researchers, it said, found that deep networks also show stronger mirror confusion for vertical compared to horizontally reflected images.

Another phenomenon peculiar to the human brain is that it focuses on coarser details first. This is known as the global advantage effect. For example, in an image of a tree, our brain would first see the tree as a whole before noticing the details of the leaves in it.

Georgin Jacob, first author and PhD student at CNS, said surprisingly, neural networks showed a local advantage. This means that unlike the brain, the networks focus on the finer details of an image first.

“Lots of studies have been showing similarities between deep networks and brains, but no one has really looked at systematic differences,” Mr. Arun was quoted as saying.

The IISc release said identifying these differences can push us closer to making these networks more brain-like and help researchers build more robust neural networks that not only perform better, but are also immune to “adversarial attacks” that aim to derail them.","The Drug Controller of Karnataka has appointed 26 government employees and officers to manage the war room.

A survey conducted on the direction of the High Court of Karnataka has identified 720 minor children engaged in begging or hawking in 432 hotspots across the city, and 27 of these children appear to be forced to do so by a mafia.

While pointing out that 492 of these children are below the age of 10, the survey has pointed out that 52 children are engaged in begging as a profession, 219 children are begging or hawking on account of family problems, 76 infants are being carried by their mothers or caretakers either for begging or hawking.

As many as 337 children are connected to persons who are engaged in construction and other small works, and nine children are handicapped or disabled, the report stated.

On a mafia controlling 27 children, the survey report said: “Upon talking to them, the children were found speaking different languages. There is a strong doubt with regard to these children belonging to their handlers as there are major differences in colour, mannerism and language of these children, and these children were found frequently revealing different names to the public.” The report recommended immediate action to rescue these children from their handlers.

“If proper investigation is carried out in respect of these suspicious groups with 27 children, the issue of missing children can be cracked,” the report stated.

The Karnataka State Legal Services Authority (KSLSA) submitted the report after conducting the survey during January-March 2021 with the help of various NGOs, law students, para legal volunteers, officials of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the city police, and other departments of the State government. The survey used a mobile app – We are 4 child – developed with the help of Kochi-based Abhishek Krishnan, a founder of Strofes Technologies, for collection of data.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj, which perused the report, said that it would issue detailed directions on April 23. The court had ordered the survey on a PIL petition filed by city-based Letzkit Foundation espousing the cause of minor children begging and selling flowers and other articles on the streets.

Suggestions

The report recommended proper counselling for children engaged in begging or hawking as a profession or owing to family economic problems, and their parents or caretakers, sending them back to their native places or providing shelter in the city, admitting them in schools, and providing employment to their parents or caretakers.

For children engaged in labour along with their parents in construction and other works, the report suggested relief through Child Labour Act. All these children must be provided with Aadhaar to enable them to get benefits of various government schemes, the KSLSA said.

Food coupons

Pointing out that children are into begging in Bengaluru due to higher amount of alms paid to them in cash by the public, the KSLSA suggested that the government create awareness amongst the public to give food coupons to those begging on streets instead of cash.","Case involves more than ₹50 lakh in compensation

The Doddaballapura Rural police have taken up a case of cheating and forgery against officials of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited for allegedly cheating a woman by installing power lines on her ancestral property without her authorisation and cheating her of more than ₹50 lakh in compensation.

In her complaint, Chanalakshmmamma, 55, a resident of Allalasandra, said that she owns agricultural land in Kamaluru and Antarahalli. She alleged that officials drew 765 KV power lines on her land and sanctioned ₹54 lakh as compensation without her knowledge. She alleged that forged documents were used to withdraw the amount.

An initial enquiry has revealed that the officials concerned sanctioned the amount to relatives of the complainant, a senior police officer said. “We have issued a notice to the officials seeking details of the amount sanctioned and remitted.”","Work was to be completed in 30 months by November 2019, but is far from complete

With nearly no progress for months, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has decided to terminate the tender for the Ejipura elevated corridor. The civic body will be floating a fresh tender to complete the 2.5-km elevated corridor.

BBMP Chief Engineer (Projects) N. Ramesh told The Hindu that the work, which was to be completed in 30 months by November 2019, is far from complete. Of the 81 pillars, only 67 have been constructed. Just around 50% of work has been completed. “We have already initiated the process of terminating the tender. We will have to float a global tender for the remainder of the work,” he said.

The work had been contracted to M/s Simplex Infrastructure Ltd. and the work order was issued in May 2017.

“Despite several notices to the contractor, there was no progress on the ground, which was inconveniencing many motorists and residents of surrounding areas,” said BBMP sources.

Incidentally, Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) had terminated a contract with the company for pending work on an elevated section of the Pink Line on Bannerghatta Road. BMRCL floated a new tender and had pointed out that the contractor could not execute the work as per the tender conditions.

B.T.M. Layout MLA Ramalinga Reddy said that the elevated corridor, which was taken up at a cost of ₹203.20 crore, was initially planned to reduce traffic congestion, besides reducing commute time by at least 30 minutes.

“Several meetings were chaired by the BBMP Chief Commissioners and even the Administrator. The roads were in poor condition due to the ongoing work. For three years, there were no street lights on the 2.5-km stretch. The contractor just could not adhere to the tender conditions despite several notices,” he said, and added that he had utilised some special funds to repair the roads that had been dug up for shifting utilities, apart from installing new street lights along the entire stretch. “All that remains now is footpath repair. Hopefully, whoever bags the new tender will expedite the work.”

Seven junctions along the corridor

The elevated corridor from Ejipura to Kendriya Sadan will cover seven junctions – Ejipura Main Road-Outer Ring Road junction, Sony World junction, Kendriya Sadan junction, Koramangala 8th Main junction, Koramangala 60 feet road junction, Koramangala 5th Block, 1st A Cross junction, and Koramangala BDA junction. It is expected to ease vehicular movement to Tavarekere, M.G. Road, Halasoor Road, Agara, B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Sarjapur Main Road and Vivekanagar via Kendriya Sadan junction.","This continues to be a huge problem despite the State government claiming that oxygen is not in short supply

Although the State government has been claiming that there is no shortage of liquid medical oxygen, many hospitals continued to ask their admitted patients to shift to other facilities as they are running out of stock. Government helplines 108 and 1912 were flooded with calls seeking help.

Since Tuesday morning, the Emergency Response Team (ERT), a volunteer group, has been getting many calls from desperate families. ERT volunteers said they have got several calls from families of patients admitted in as many eight hospitals in various parts of the city on Tuesday, requesting help in finding oxygenated beds.

At Athreya Hospital in Chandapura, families of five critical patients had been informed on Tuesday morning that oxygen stock would not last more than half an hour. “Following our desperate pleas, the Bengaluru Urban District Health Officer (DHO) G.A. Srinivas visited our hospital and made some temporary arrangements to last for a day. On his assurance, we have sent a truck with 20 jumbo cylinders for refilling from the Peenya Refilling plant. However, we lost one of the five patients,” said Narayan Swamy, hospital medical director.

Prasanna H.M., president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said many smaller hospitals are shelling out five-six times more than the regular price for procuring oxygen from vendors in neighbouring States. “It is difficult to get even if we are ready to pay the high cost. I managed to buy 2 kilolitres from a vendor in Hosur on Tuesday paying ₹95 per metric tonne as against ₹22 per metric tonne. If the situation continues, my hospital will stop admitting patients from Wednesday,” he said.

Disputing the government claims of ‘no shortage’, Dr. Prasanna said, “Let the health officials visit each hospital to check the ground reality. Unless the liquid re-fillers supply more to the vendors, they cannot supply to us.” He hoped the government’s assurance of diverting industrial oxygen for medical purposes would materialise soon. “The oxygen war room that has been set up to facilitate supply to hospitals is of no use. Hospitals who call up the war room are being reprimanded for the high consumption,” he claimed.

Bengaluru Urban DHO Srinivas said he visited several hospitals on Tuesday and assessed the demand. “The problem is many smaller hospitals is that they do not have storage capacity for more oxygen. They have to refill their existing cylinders as and when they become empty. We have made arrangements for these hospitals to send their cylinders to be refilled at the Peenya plant,” he said.

Call centre

Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said that a round-the-clock call centre to monitor supply of oxygen and Remedisivir to hospitals has been set up. “We have deputed 29 personnel who will work in three shifts from Wednesday itself to ensure smooth supply,” he said.

JSW Steel to help

JSW Steel has agreed to supply 400 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day to the State to treat COVID-19 patients. This comes after a meeting between Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh R. Nirani and the representatives of JSW Steel led by Deputy Managing Director Vinod Nowal.

The Minister, who convened a meeting with representatives of several steel companies who produce liquid oxygen for their use in steel production, called upon them to produce oxygen in huge quantity to address the public health emergency.","The Naavu Bharateeyaru – a collection of NGOs – has criticised the Karnataka government for its failure to cope with the second wave of COVID-19. “At this crucial juncture, we are seeing a massive failure of the State on two planks – acute shortage of beds for seriously ill patients and lack of oxygen supply. These failures are resulting in an egregious violation of the Fundamental Right to Life of all persons in India,” said a statement.

They pointed out that seriously ill patients are running from pillar to post to get admitted even while some private hospitals are refusing to take them. “Those admitted have received exorbitant bills ranging from ₹3-5 lakhs. Hospitals in turn are discharging seriously ill patients on the premise that oxygen is not available.”

The collective noted that civil society and volunteer groups, that are trying to bridge the gap, are “overwhelmed with the endless demands for oxygen, sometimes from hospitals”.","Karnataka on Tuesday logged its biggest single day spike of 21,794 new cases of COVID-19. This is more than double the highest number of cases reported on a single during the first outbreak last year. With this, the total number of positive cases rose to 11,98,644. The positivity rate for the day touched 14.77%.

An epicentre of the pandemic, Bengaluru Urban, reported 13,782 new cases on Tuesday. With this, this district’s COVID-19 tally touched 5,70,035, nearly half of the State’s total cases.

With 149 deaths, the toll rose to 13,646. This is apart from 19 deaths of patients due to non-COVID-19 reasons. Tuesday’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) stood at 0.68%.

Last year, during the first outbreak, the State had reported the highest single day spike of 10,947 cases on October 7. Bengaluru Urban’s last year’s record was 5,121 on October 8.

As many as 4,571 persons were discharged on Tuesday, taking the total number of recoveries to 10,25,821. Of the remaining 1,59,158 active patients, 751 are being monitored in ICUs.

The number of active cases crossed the one lakh mark and touched 1,07,315 on April 16 when the State had reported 14,859 cases. This is over a month after the onset of the second wave.

However, during last year’s outbreak active cases had crossed one lakh on September 10, six months after the pandemic hit Karnataka on March 8.

As many as 1,47,488 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, including 1,30,957 RT-PCR tests. With this, the total number of tests rose to 2,37,16,866.

Vaccination

The State has vaccinated 72,98,514 people till 3.30 p.m. on Tuesday. This includes 5,79,258 healthcare workers and 2,61,413 frontline workers who have taken the first dose of vaccination. As many as 3,67,245 healthcare workers and 1,13,244 frontline workers have taken the second dose as well. On Tuesday, 72,706 beneficiaries had taken the jab till 3.30 p.m.","An autopsy on a 68-year-old female COVID-19 patient’s body, who died on April 5 in a city hospital, has revealed that her vital organs - lungs, brain and kidneys - had been damaged extensively although she had tested negative on the 12th day. The autopsy revealed that the cause of death in this case was Acute Myocardial Infarction.

The autopsy, the second in the city, was done on April 7 by Dinesh Rao, who heads the Department of Forensic Medicine in Oxford Medical College and Research Institute. “We did the autopsy following a request from the patient’s son as he wanted to know the exact cause of death,” Dr. Rao said. The patient, who was admitted for three days, was advised home isolation despite her comorbidities - diabetes and hypertension. However, she developed respiratory complications after 12 days and was rushed to the hospital again when she tested negative. She died on April 5.

“Unlike in the first autopsy on a 62-year-old patient in October last year when RT-PCR swabs revealed the virus was active in the mouth, throat and nasal area 18 hours after death, the swabs from six regions in this second body were RT-PCR negative. But her lungs, brain and kidneys were extensively damaged,” he said. “She had developed lung fibrosis and together both the lungs weighed around 900 grams. The virus that had infected her brain and kidneys could not be detected by RT-PCR,” he added.

“Her comorbidities were the underlying causes, while COVID-19 was the main factor. The RT-PCR negative reports of the six swabs indicate the possibility of different mutated strains of the virus or the delay in postmortem sampling,” he said.

However, virologist V. Ravi, who is the nodal officer for genomic confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka said RT-PCR tests used in India do not miss the U.K., Brazil, South Africa or the double mutant variants of the virus as they target more than two genes. “This autopsy shows that the patient dies of post-COVID-19 complications,” Dr. Ravi added.","With an increasing number of apartment complexes and multi-dwelling units becoming hotspots, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has now decided to test residents living in these communities.

In this regard, the civic body has appointed nodal officials for each zone, who will coordinate with the representatives of the zonal apartment welfare associations.

On priority

The nodal officials have been instructed to test residents of apartments and multi-dwelling units that have evinced interest in getting tested for COVID-19 on priority and later rope in the remaining residential communities in the zones.

Bed availability

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike will also be deputing nodal officers across all hospitals to ensure that beds are available for those in need.

Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, BBMP’s chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said that these nodal officials, under the supervision of the jurisdictional medical officers of health, will be directed to check if patients admitted in the hospitals needed medical intervention.

Admission of those who don’t need medical intervention was one of the main reasons for shortage of beds, he said.

Mr. Gupta estimated that with the active case load increasing by the day, nearly 11,000 beds may be required.

Demand for oxygen

Shortage of beds isn’t the only the concern. “The demand for oxygen has increased nearly fivefold. We will have the nodal officers also look into whether oxygen is being administered only in cases that need it,” said Mr. Gupta, adding that the government has constituted a committee to address this shortage.

Some hospitals are yet to hand over the beds. “We have already issued notices to such medical facilities. We will not hesitate to initiate stringent action against such institutions. We also considering closure of out-patient departments in such private medical facilities,” he added.","In the midst of a pandemic expanding its tentacles further, parts of the State will be facing another election on April 27, close on the heels of the byelections to a Lok Sabha and two Legislative Assembly seats.

Caught between a High Court order to hold elections and a demand for cancellation of polls from a section in political leaders, the State Election Commission (SEC) is in a fix. The rapid surge of COVID-19 cases has forced the commission to direct the candidates to restrict their campaigning to door-to-door visits with less than five persons.

Elections to as many as 10 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Ballari, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan, Chickballapur, Shivamogga, Ramanagaram, Bhadravathi, Madikeri, and Bidar districts are scheduled on April 27. Districts such as Chickballapur, Bidar, Ballari, and Hassan have a high active caseload already. As the elections heated up with local politicians campaigning and crowds swelling, an anxious SEC on Monday restricted campaigning.

‘Put them off’

Early last week, in light of COVID-19 spreading in Bidar, Janata Dal (S) Legislative Party deputy leader Bandeppa Kashempur had urged that the elections be put off. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) this week demanded the same.

However, sources in the SEC defended the elections to ULBs, stating that it was a High Court-mandated election that they had to hold. “Elections are being held to ULBs in these districts after a gap of over two years. The elections had been stalled because of legal wrangles over reservation,” a source told The Hindu.

A senior official said, “If we put off the elections, there is a fear of facing the wrath of the court. Before deciding to go ahead with the schedule, we consulted legal experts on the implications of putting off the elections after the notification was issued.”

The official said that the Election Commission was still holding Assembly elections in West Bengal. “If the second wave had hit before the notification of the schedule, the commission would not have announced the dates.”","The all-party meeting chaired by Governor Vajubhai Vala on the COVID-19 situation in the State had leaders reaching no consensus on the “strong measures” to be taken by the State government for containing the rise in cases. While the Congress favoured stricter implementation of the recommendations of the State’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), the JD(S) suggested a total lockdown for 15 days.

Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah, who opposed the meeting chaired by the Governor to start with, suggested that the government put off all upcoming elections to urban and rural local bodies such as zilla and taluk panchayats. Testing should be made mandatory for people visiting from other States, he said.

He also said the government should go for stricter implementation of the recommendations of the TAC, while night curfew and lockdown were not solutions. The government showed laxity in the implementation of the suggestions made by the TAC in November last on the possible second wave of COVID-19, he charged.

Another former Chief Minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, strongly favoured a total lockdown and urged the government to provide financial support to the poor for one month for the purchase of essential items. He suggested that the government stop development works this year and focus on providing better health infrastructure.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar said the government had failed to contain the virus since it was unable to fix the accountability among the Ministers. He suggested stricter execution of actions based on the TAC report and also stoppage of development works for the next one year.

The Governor and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and participated in meeting virtually, heard the various suggestions made by the leaders of the Opposition parties. In his address, he said the government would take further steps considering the directions of the Governor and the Opposition leaders.

During the past one year, infrastructure development in government hospitals was taken up on priority basis and as a result, there was a 12% increase in beds while the number of oxygenated beds had increased manifold with 29,667 beds. “An order has been issued to reserve 50% of the beds in private hospitals for COVID-19 patients. There is also no shortage of Remdesivir,” he said.

Earlier, Health and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar presented a report about COVID-19 cases in the State and the measures taken to control further spread of infections.

Governor’s advice

The Governor suggested that the State government to take strong steps for “a healthy Karnataka and not wealthy Karnataka”. In a press release, he said he had suggested to the government to take some strong steps and precautionary measures. The Governor chaired the 150-minute virtual meeting from the Raj Bhavan.","Dr. K Sudhakar, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, and Bangalore South Lok Sabha MP Tejasvi Surya during a meeting with representatives of oxygen production plants in the state earlier this week.

The Karnataka government Wednesday began operating a war room in Bengaluru to look into the supply of medical oxygen and Remdesivir at hospitals in Bengaluru.

“In order to ensure timely & sufficient supply of Oxygen and #Remdesivir a 24/7 war room has been established with staff working round the clock in 3 shifts,” Health and Medical Education Minister K Sudhakar confirmed in a tweet.

As per an order issued by the State Drug Controller, 26 officers and government staff have been appointed to operate the war room. The development comes in the wake of several hospitals in the state, especially in Bengaluru, continuing to report a shortage of medical oxygen since last week with the Covid-19 caseload increasing manifolds.

Bengaluru has over 1.14 lakh active Covid-19 cases as on Tuesday, while the same from across the state is nearly 1.6 lakh. The Karnataka capital has reported 1,35,208 new cases and 693 deaths since the beginning of this month while the same for the state are at 2,01,640 1079 respectively.

Earlier this week, Sudhakar, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, and Bangalore South Lok Sabha MP Tejasvi Surya had met representatives of oxygen production plants in the state in a bid to streamline the process. After the meeting, Shettar held a discussion with top officials to discuss various measures to tackle issues related to oxygen shortage experienced in the state.

Further, in a bid to address oxygen supply issues reported from Chamarajanagar district, the state government installed a new medical oxygen plant at Chamarajanagar District Hospital. “The medical oxygen plant has six-kilo litre capacity and will be operational very soon,” Sudhakar said.

The war room is also expected to help resolve several issues pointed out by volunteers working on field to help critically-ill patients get admitted to hospitals and to further treatment using Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used as an emergency measure to treat patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 infection.

“The government’s move to open a war room is welcome. Better late than never as black market and fake sellers were on the rise in Bengaluru, Mysuru and in other parts of the state,” a volunteer from the Emergency Response Team (ERT) set up by individuals and members of various NGOs and other organisations in Bengaluru told Indianexpress.com

Earlier this week, Mysuru City Police had arrested a staff nurse working at a private hospital for allegedly refilling cheap antibiotic medicines or saline solution in empty vials of Remdesivir for sale to needy patients.

Last Saturday, the Central Crime Branch had arrested three people in Bengaluru for their alleged involvement in stocking and selling Remdesivir.

Bangalore University allows work from home to teaching, non-teaching staff

In the wake of the ongoing pandemic situation, the Bangalore University Wednesday allowed its teaching and non-teaching staff to work from home. While the teaching staff has been directed to take online classes till May 4, non-teaching staff can continue to do so till April 30, an order issued by Vice-Chancellor Venugopal K R mentioned.

“The teaching staff shall submit the work done statement through Google forms through the respective Chairperson of the Department. The staff of essential services, however, shall continue to work from their respective offices,” Venugopal clarified.

In the wake of Karnataka announcing new measures such as a weekend curfew and extended night curfew timings till May 4, the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) Wednesday clarified that the ongoing examinations held for first-semester undergraduate engineering students shall continue, “as per academic requirement.”

“The first semester examinations will be conducted as per the schedule notified with all precautions and safety measures in place,” Registrar Prof A S Deshpande said. He added that students who might miss the examination due to the pandemic situation will be allowed to attend the exams later. “Such students will be permitted to take the missed examination during the even semester exams conducted next, and shall be treated as first attempt.”

(Representational)

A team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru has discovered remarkable differences between deep neural networks — machine learning systems inspired by the network of brain cells or neurons in the human brain — and the human brain itself, which they believe would help in bridging the characteristic gaps between them.

According to SP Arun, associate professor at Centre for Neuroscience (CNS) at IISc, many studies showing similarities between deep networks and brains were already available. “However, none has really looked at their systematic differences, which would help us get closer to making these networks more brain-like,” he said.

Also the senior author of the study which compared the visual perception between neural networks and the human brain, Arun added that such networks were still nowhere close to performing as well as the human brain in perceiving visual cues, despite having evolved significantly over the past decade.

Explaining how the study was carried out, PhD student and first author of the study Georgin Jacob said, “Neural networks, unlike the brain, focussed on the finer details of an image first”. This, he said, helped the team understand that these networks and the human brain followed very different steps in carrying out the same object recognition tasks like identifying details of a face.

Jacob added that humans first look at the face as a whole and then focus on finer details like the eyes, nose, mouth and so on when presented with an image, while the same for neural networks took place in the inverse order.

Further, the team studied 13 different perceptual effects and uncovered previously unknown qualitative differences between deep networks and the human brain. “An example is the Thatcher effect, a phenomenon where humans find it easier to recognise local feature changes in an upright image, but this becomes difficult when the image is flipped upside-down. Deep networks trained to recognise upright faces showed a Thatcher effect when compared with networks trained to recognise objects,” an IISc release mentioned.

The current study has been published in Nature Communications, a widely recognised peer-reviewed journal that covers topics in natural sciences, including physics, chemistry, earth sciences, medicine, and biology.

“Such analyses can help researchers build more robust neural networks that not only perform better but are also immune to ‘adversarial attacks’ that aim to derail them,” the Institute added.","Nearly half of the Abanal village in Karnataka’s Belagavi district tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.

According to health department officials, 144 of the 360 villagers were found infected during random testing. Most of them had returned recently from Maharashtra to participate in a festival.

“The native people working in Maharashtra visited the village for the festival. After the festival, few people were admitted to local primary health care centres after they complained of vomiting fever and other symptoms. As per the protocol, we collected their samples and they tested positive,” Khanapur taluk medical officer Dr Sanjeeva Nadre told Indianexpress.com.

The second surge of the Covid pandemic is ravaging the country right now. At a time like this, it is each individual’s fundamental responsibility to see to it that you yourself are not infected, and to ensure that no one else around you is infected. And in case it happens to come to you, it must stop with you, it should not go to another person. This is the commitment we should make. The virus is not being carried by a mosquito, rat or some other animal. It is us carrying it from person to person. Only we can stop it. This can only happen with responsible and conscious behaviour. Now that we have vaccines — fortunately, made-in-India vaccines — everyone must go for vaccination as the government opens it up age group by age group. There are people talking about being anti-vaccine. For all those people, I have one simple question: How many of you would be alive today if you were not vaccinated in your childhood? How many of us would be able to stand on our legs and live our life as we are? Modern medicine is a boon in many ways. It is not an answer to every aspect of our health, but it is a great boon.","Officials said full-fledged operations will commence from Thursday. TOI FILE: Syed Asif

BENGALURU: Bus commuters across Karnataka heaved a sigh of relief as employees of four state-run bus corporations, including KSRTC and BMTC , called off their 15-day strike on Wednesday.

Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha , who is leading the strike, said: âWe have decided to temporarily withdraw the strike respecting the high court order.â

However, he said, they will go on a strike again if their demands are not met. âItâs our right to protest against the state government. All employees will return to duty from Thursday. But, they have taken action against several employees for not reporting to duty and they should withdraw these orders,â he added.

The Karnataka high court on Tuesday said that even if the employeesâ demands were legitimate, this is possibly the worst time to go on strike since the state is grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic.

Transport department officials said full-fledged operations will commence from Thursday. However, a majority of employees returned to duty on Wednesday morning following the court order. Till 8pm Wednesday four STUs operated 13,084 buses including KSRTC (4,970), BMTC (2,815) and NEKRTC (2,248) and NWKRTC (3,051). They operated 18,100 buses before the strike.

Since April 7, 119 buses were damaged. These include KSRTC (73), BMTC (6), NWKRTC (13) and NEKRTC (27). However, STUs are yet to calculate losses due to vehicle damage. Meanwhile, revenue loss to four STUs due to cancellation of services is around Rs 287 crore. This includes KSRTC (Rs 122.5 crore), BMTC (Rs 45 crore), NWKRTC (Rs 57.5 crore) NEKRTC (Rs 62 crore).

This is the longest strike in the history of STUs in Karnataka as the previous longest agitation lasted only five days. Passengers had to use private operators for emergency travel.

Deputy CM and transport minister Laxman Savadi said the strike withdrawal is a relief for the public, especially for the poor. He thanked private operators for providing alternative arrangements and said the government is sympathetic to employeesâ demands.

Over 1.3 lakh employees have been on strike since April 7, seeking revision of salaries on par with Sixth Pay Commission recommendations. However, STUs managed to operate many buses in the past few days: from 236 buses on April 7, 1626 on April 10, 2663 on April 11, 4283 on April 15 and 5644 on April 16.

The government said it cannot implement pay revision according to the Sixth Pay Commission because of its financial position. Several arm-twisting tactics adopted by STUs against protesting employees include dismissing and suspending employees, transferring KSRTC employees, threatening to vacate staff quarters, not releasing March salaries, no work-no pay rule and also insisting on a medical fitness report for employees who are over 55 years. The government also booked cases against employees under ESMA.

We did not learn anything fromin 2020 and we’re suffering the consequences in 2021, say scientists and doctorsCovid 2.0 makes Covid 1.0 looks like a dress rehearsal. But with all the problems with bed management, dearth of ambulances and, deaths and misery and crematoriums running overtime, looks like we did not learn anything, nor did we put any processes in place to tackle a rerun.Prof Mohit Sinha of BML Munjal University said one of the reasons (see box for more) for the disastrous second wave is that the government failed to monitor the seven-day weekly moving average which was consistently showing exponential growth even though the absolute numbers were small. “To say the least, we were complacent and now we’re paying the price for it.”Sanjeev Mysore, convenor of Jeevan Raksha, said, “Between October to January, Karnataka’s average tests per day were in the range of 95,000 to 1 lakh plus. However, thedropped to 62,000 in February. Another issue withwas the high concentration of testing inWhile 18 per cent of the population of the state was in Bengaluru, 40 per cent of the overall Covid tests were being held in Bengaluru alone. Due to this, there was a sharp surge in the rest of Karnataka between August to October,” Mysore said, adding that like other states in India, in 2020, the testing objective was to contain the spread of the virus followed by effective quarantine management. In 2021, testing was carried out for transactional and movement purposes and quarantine management practices were diluted.Dr. Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor said, “The government should have proactively responded to the emerging crisis rather than offer knee jerk responses after the media uproar.The government needs to address crucial issues - regulation of the private healthcare sector so that patients are not exploited, uninterrupted provision of oxygen, other drugs, lab reagents and material, training of doctors and volunteers to build a supportive referral and treatment network, helplines for patients and their families to handle crises, and regular updates to reassure frontline workers and citizens that the government is in charge. The government has to ensure thatwith healthcare staff and oxygen supply is set up close to communities especially the poor and vulnerable. The process for booking beds for critically ill patients should be made much more accessible and user-friendly. Currently, this is daunting especially for those who do not have access to the internet and other facilities.”Tousif Masood, a volunteer of Mercy Mission who has been supporting oxygen supply and relief work said, “As a first effort, the government should have stopped the checked for the virus at airports, ship ports and road entries. That didn’t happen. We should have been prepared for another disaster, but that didn’t happen.”B1617, the double mutant strain which is ravagingand adjoining states was first found on October 5, 2020, at NIV Pune.Govt. of India and Ministry of Biotech did not have funds to do medium-scale genome sequencing of this mutation on random samples of our positive cases and report to WHO.A budget allocation of Rs. 80 cr was made as late as March this year. Meanwhile, a triple mutation has also been established by NIV Pune very recently.Even after this fund allocation in March, we are sequencing only 1% of our positive cases as against 5%+ in US and 10%+ in UK who are clinically relating it to the clinical symptoms and manifestations of the sequenced mutants.In our case clinical correlation of even the 1% +ve cases, sequencing is not being done to find out virulence, contagiousness etc of B1617 or other newly sequenced strains. We are still lagging far behind global standards. If we had the data on the percentage of our Maharashtra or Punjab cases being B1617 or UK strains respectively in Nov-Dec-Jan-Feb etc with clinical correlation with symptoms, we wouldn’t have been caught napping.This surge is not just due to public Covidiocy, or State / Police laxity. It’s due to the unbridled growth of much more contagious Amravati (B1617) and UK mutants while the Central Government and theexpert teams were taking mutants’ genomic study lightly and living in a fool’s paradise. They assumed new mutants would be in minuscule numbers. Add to that a lazy vaccine rollout amidst a Covid delinquent population with lax local administration and police will.","Most of those in the tumtum were labourers on the way to work when the mishap took place, the police said.

BENGALURU: Bus users across the state can hope for some relief soon as the indefinite strike called by the state transport employees is fast losing steam.

The stir, which began on April 7, will enter its 15th day on Wednesday. However, State Transport Undertakings (STUs) are planning full-fledged operations. Four STUs, including KSRTC and BMTC, operated 7,848 buses on Tuesday. On Monday, they had run 5,929 buses.

âOn Tuesday, we operated more than 40% of buses. The number will go up in the coming days as more employees are returning to duty. But the number of passengers travelling in buses has reduced due to spike in Covid-19 cases,â said a senior transport department official, adding that more than 50% of KSRTC buses are operational.

âBoth NEKRTC and NWKRTC are operating 45% schedules each. BMTC is running 35% of its fleet. We are hoping for normal operations from Thursday. But union leaders are misleading some employees through fake messages circulated on social media,â said an official.

He said the striking union has no other option but to withdraw its agitation. âNow, the high court also stated that the strike is untimely. So they will be forced to withdraw it,â the official added.

Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Employeesâ League, which launched the indefinite strike to press for a pay hike, said they will continue with it. R Chandrashekhar, president of the league, said: âWe didnât approach the court. We have also not received the court order yet. We will decide on the next course of action after getting advice from our legal team on Wednesday.â

Sources say the state governmentâs reluctance to negotiate, coupled with arm-twisting tactics, forced many employees to join duty. âWe have been waiting for a compromise but the government is adamant. How long can we afford to strike? They have not even given us our March salary. But our anger will reflect in the upcoming elections,â said a BMTC conductor, who reported to work on Tuesday.

âA majority of them are trainees and probationary staff, who didnât report to duty. In KSRTC, errant employees were transferred to other districts, but this is not possible with BMTC as it operates only in Bengaluru,â said an official. However, STUs revoked suspension of 56 employees, including 47 in KSRTC.

Officials said 114 buses of four STUs have been damaged so far and around 467 employees were involved in the act. Of this, 112 have been arrested. STUs also filed 52 FIRs against 232 employees under KESMA Act and arrested 55 of them.

BENGALURU: The Centre's approval of Namma Metro's Outer Ring Road-Kempegowda International Airport (Light Blue) line has brought cheer to Bengalureans coping with the second wave of Covid-19.

Durga Shanker Mishra, secretary to the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, said the project will be ready only by 2026. ""This line will be completed by 2026 and cost Rs 14,788 crore, with equal equity participation of the Centre and state.""

""With pre-project activities on and loans already arranged, BMRCL is ready to start work right away...This corridor is projected to carry 7.7 lakh passengers daily in 2026. This will greatly relieve the city of congestion and consequent pollution,"" said Mishra.

""Bengaluru already has close to 49km of Metro operational. Work on another 66km is under way. With another 58km approved, the total network in the next five years will be over 170km. This will ensure ease in movement in the city. The new corridor will connect major areas at Central Silk Board, KR Puram and Nagawara and IT hubs to provide an effective public transport mode,"" said Mishra.

In 2016, BMRCL prepared a DPR for the 19km Central Silk Board-KR Puram line on ORR. In October 2020, Mumbai-based Afcons Infrastructure Limited and Bengaluru-based Shankaranarayana Constructions Pvt Ltd emerged as the lowest bidders in two different packages for ORR Metro. BMRCL also completed land acquisition for the same. However, it didn't issue a work order due to delay in getting Centre's nod.

Tuesday's approval spells relief for thousands of airport-bound passengers. The estimated time from KR Puram to KIA on Metro is around 45 minutes. Currently, airport-bound passengers are mainly dependent on private cabs and BMTC's Vayu Vajra services.

Public-private partnership

This is also the first time that BMRCL is forging a public private partnership to raise funds through innovative financing methods. Bangalore International Airport Limited will develop, manage and maintain the two Metro stations within the airport boundary. It has also tied up with firms like Embassy (Kadubeesanahalli and Bettahalasur), Intel (Bellandur) and Prestige Group (Kodibisanahalli).

Rakesh Singh, additional chief secretary and BMRCL MD, said: ""The tender for ORR Metro can be awarded in a week's time. Tenders for Airport Metro will be opened on May 15.

This project will be implemented through innovative financing of private participation. Long-term station naming and access rights of Rs 850 crore and monetisation of Metro assets on airport premises (Rs 800 crore) are part of this concept. External funding with JICA ($318 million) and ADB ( $500 million) is already arranged.""

","BENGALURU: While the elderly and those with underlying health issues are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19, the second wave in Bengaluru has a new dimension: The average age of those testing positive in the tech-capital has dropped to 36 years.This has set alarm bells ringing even as health experts and the state government grapple with the pressure being mounted on health infrastructure.A review of the 1.1 lakh cases reported since the start of the second wave (from March 15 till April 16 this year) reveals that 57% of them in Bengaluru are below 40 years. A majority from this group are between 20 and 29 years of age.âIn the first wave, highrisk groups were senior citizens and those with comorbidities, but that has changed. The younger population is at risk too,â say data-trackers at the BBMP Covid War Room.Dr Giridhara R Babu, epidemiologist and member of the stateâs Covid technical advisory committee, said: âThe Covid trajectory is definitely seeing a shift from the elderly to the young. There could be many reasons for this: One, the young are moving around and their exposure to the virus is higher. Two, they are yet to be protected by vaccination. Three, they might not be following Covid-appropriate behaviour after the number of cases began declining.âWhile most of these patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms there have also been cases of serious infection and deaths among patients in their twenties. Apart from the regular symptoms such as fever and headache, young Covid-19 patients are also complaining of extreme fatigue, shortness of breath and chest congestion.âUnlike the past where it was feared the young would transmit the virus to the elderly, we are now seeing more youngsters themselves seeking hospitalisation and oxygen support,â health department officials said. In Bengaluru, the average age of fatalities due to Covid is 68 years. Dr Ravindra Mehta, chief of pulmonary, critical care and interventional pulmonology at Apollo Speciality Hospitals , Jayanagar, said: âThis is a different mutant and has a different impact. The affliction varies according to the age and group of the infected. In the second wave, the virus has a predilection to the earlier age-group.âHealth minister K Sudhakar said youngsters should not be dismissive of the virus as there is still no clarity on how a personâs immune system reacts when infected and what the disease severity would be. Moreover, the health infrastructure will be overwhelmed if more youngsters end up seeking hospitalisation, he warned.Dr Babu added: âThis is just the beginning of the second wave. It is not even the peak and finding beds in Bengaluru is becoming a challenge. It will become tougher if more younger people start making a beeline for hospital beds.â","(The writer is founder, Isha Foundation)

The second surge of the Covid pandemic is ravaging the country right now. At a time like this, it is each individualâs fundamental responsibility to see to it that you yourself are not infected, and to ensure that no one else around you is infected. And in case it happens to come to you, it must stop with you, it should not go to another person. This is the commitment we should make.The virus is not being carried by a mosquito, rat or some other animal. It is us carrying it from person to person. Only we can stop it. This can only happen with responsible and conscious behaviour.Now that we have vaccines â fortunately, made-in-India vaccines â everyone must go for vaccination as the government opens it up age group by age group. There are people talking about being anti-vaccine. For all those people, I have one simple question: How many of you would be alive today if you were not vaccinated in your childhood? How many of us would be able to stand on our legs and live our life as we are? Modern medicine is a boon in many ways. It is not an answer to every aspect of our health, but it is a great boon.So it is important that every citizen is vaccinated as and when it becomes accessible. And even if you vaccinate, you should still wear a mask and maintain social distancing. Until this pandemic is completely eliminated, all of us should maintain responsible behaviour.In the last year, the losses that people suffered in terms of human life, loss of dear ones, loss of businesses, livelihoods, and as a nation, are tremendous. The sacrifice of so many of our fellowmen will be laid to waste if we allow a second rampage. I beseech everyone, please follow protocols and commit to responsible and conscious action.

Some city-based ministers also share this view.The Bengaluru charge is held by chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who is currently recovering from Covid-19 in a hospital.After testing positive last week, he has not been able to devote time to oversee the day-to-day management of the pandemic in Bengaluru, which is reporting more than 10,000 new infections daily. Eight cabinet members from Bengaluru do not have the authority to take independent decisions.âFor everything, they have to consult the chief minister.

Yediyurappa should appoint a full-time minister for Bengaluru,â said a BJP MLA.Ever since Yediyurappa took office, there have been calls for a dedicated Bengaluru development minister. He has avoided giving up the portfolio because of fierce competition among the eight ministers. A section in BJP claims that the real reason is that he doesnât want to lose control over the city.Former Bengaluru incharge minister Ramalinga Reddy said that the tech capital needed a full-time leader to coordinate and manage emergency situations like Covid-19. âWhat is happening right now is that none of the eight ministers from Bengaluru is taking any initiative to control the spread of the virus. Nobody knows who is calling the shots as far as the fight in Bengaluru is concerned. This has made government officials complacent,â he claimed.There are reports that the ministers are unable to coordinate properly because of their personal equations. As a result, there is no collective effort on the ground, claim BJP MLAs.âEverybody is working in silos. This situation would have been there if one of them was the in-charge minister. His decisions would have been binding on others, and it would have helped fix responsibility,â said a legislator.Some BJP members said that one minister should be appointed to chair the crucial meetings in the CMâs absence to prevent any disruption of government work. âWithin the constitutional framework, one minister should be tasked with conducting official meetings and taking spot decisions.

I called up several officers, health ministerâs officers and MLAs only to be told that they were busy in meetings. Nobody helped, even the helplines were of no help,â she added.A man with Covid-like symptoms died outside the district hospital in Vijayapura on Monday. DC P Sunil Kumar said: âHis relatives searched for beds in private hospitals for 2 hours and they were told about one vacant ICU bed in the district hospital. By the time they arrived, 3-4 patients were in queue to get admitted and the situation was out of control.â P 5Subramanya had no comorbidities. One of the family members tested positive for Covid-19 a fortnight ago and the others were subsequently tested. On April 7, Subramanya tested negative and since he had no symptoms, quarantined himself at home. âIt was only when he started having acute breathing difficulty that he was taken to a hospital near Banashankari,â said Asha. Subramanya spent a few days at the hospital through the second week of April but he began to slip towards the last weekend, slipping in and out of consciousness.From Sunday night, Asha began hunting for an ICU bed for Subramanya as his condition worsened and the hospital was running out of oxygen. On Monday afternoon, he was given an ICU bed at Prashanth Hospital, near Bommanahalli.âWhen we got a request from the patientâs family on Monday afternoon, his oxygen saturation level was 65%, against the normal of 95% and above. Two hours later, when he reached our hospital, it had further dipped to just 45%. We did out best. He was on ventilator, but we lost him. The patient would have definitely survived had he received the right treatment at right time,â said Dr Vishwanath Reddy, managing director of Prashanth Hospital.Subramanya died around 7.30pm on Monday. âHis was a case of Covid pneumonia which was not detected through RT-PCR test but found by an HRCT [high-resolution computed tomography] scan of the chest.âAsha said Subramanyaâs father, Srinvas, who was being treated for Covid at a private hospital near Katriguppe in south Bengaluru, died on April 17. Family members were not available to speak to TOI. Subramanyaâs last rites were performed on Tuesday mor ning.Asha said she had been able to help more than 150 patients last year to secure beds through her network in the medical fraternity as she is a regular blood donor. âThis time, even as hospitals are trying their best, there is a shortage of oxygen supply and there are no ventilators available. We lost Subramanya because of government incapabilities in handling the Covid emergency,â she said.Turned away by private hospitals, a man with Covid-like symptoms died outside Vijayapura district hospital on Monday. Witnesses said he struggled for about 2 hours and died in front of his wife and children. Expressing regret, deputy commissioner P Sunil Kumar said the manâs oxygen saturation level had dipped to 50% when he reached the hospital. âWe learnt that he was suffering after fever and breathing issues and wandered for two hours in the city to get admitted to private hospitals. One of his relatives visited the district hospital and was told that one bed was available in ICU. By the time the patient was brought, 3-4 patients were in queue to be admitted in ICU.âThe DC said ICU beds are full in government hospitals in the district but general beds are available. âWe appeal to people to visit a fever clinic as soon as they develop Covid symptoms,â Kumar said.","A few private hospitals said the going rate in the city is Rs 800-Rs 900 per cylinder.

BENGALURU: Private hospitals here say unorganised sector suppliers of medical oxygen from whom they are forced to procure it are charging at least thrice the price fixed by the government.

However, industry representatives insist the organised sector is selling by the book.

Both agree that demand has gone up by at least 300% with a surge in ICU and HDU admissions as the second wave of Covid-19 sweeps across Bengaluru. Industry representatives, while allaying fears of a prolonged supply problem, said the demand could be met by the weekend.

Health minister K Sudhakar told TOI that action will be initiated against those overcharging, while reiterating that supply will improve over the next few days.

Doctor: Many hosps buying oxygen from wherever they can

Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association , said: âMedical oxygen price per cubic metre is regulated which is inclusive of transport cost. Given the shortage, many hospitals, especially smaller ones, are buying from wherever they can get it. Last week, I paid Rs 75 per cubic metre, which is almost thrice the prescribed cost.â

A few private hospitals said the going rate in the city is Rs 800-Rs 900 per cylinder. Puneet Sonu, an OT staff at Krishna hospital , said: âWe need 25-26 cylinders every 12 hours. With regular suppliers unable to meet our demand, we are forced to purchase from outside. On Tuesday, we purchased 10 cylinders at Rs 900 each.â

Subhashish Guha Roy, MD, Universal Air Products, said the cost of a cylinder is Rs 202, including 12% tax while transport charges are additional. âWe donât charge more than the fixed price,â he said.

At least two other big suppliers TOI spoke with said there was no overcharging, while pointing out that the demand has increased multifold.

An industry representative said Akash hospital is installing a 6,000-litre vessel. Guruprasad Rao, senior manager (sales & marketing), Bhuruka Gases, said: âWe produce 65 tonnes per day. Before the pandemic, we sold 50 tonnes per day, now, we sell nearly everything we produce and 80% is going to hospitals.â

BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Tuesday night announced a weekend corona curfew, extended the daily night curfew across the state and increased its duration by two hours, amid a worrisome surge in daily Covid-19 infections.

The new curbs will be in effect for14 days â from April 21 till May 4. The weekend curfew will be enforced from 9pm on Friday to 6am on Monday. The night curfew on weekdays will now be from 9pm to 6am.

Announcing the restrictions, Karnataka chief secretary P Ravi Kumar urged residents to stay indoors. âThis is not a lockdown, but a middle ground,â he said.

Apart from this, the government announced closure of schools, colleges, coaching classes and other educational institutions, cinema halls, shopping malls, gyms, swimming pools and entertainment and amusement parks. All places of worship will also remain closed during this period. While all bars and restaurants will remain closed, the government has allowed standalone liquor outlets to operate.

During the weekend curfew, only essential services and home delivery of food will be allowed. Neighbourhood shops, milk booths, fish and mutton stalls will be allowed to operate between 6am and 10am. Medical transportation and industries with essential work, telecom and internet service providers, IT/ITeS personnel will be allowed to operate. The movement of essential services will be allowed only on producing valid ID proof.

Inter-state and inter-district movement of people will also be allowed on producing valid tickets and documents. Marriages can have up to 50 people while only up to 20 can attend funerals.

The government also banned all social, cultural, political and religious events. The existing limit on gatherings in permitted functions will be reduced to 200 for outdoor events and 100 for indoor ones. Government offices will function with 50% staff strength, and the general public will be allowed to meet officers only with prior appointment.

Earlier, on Tuesday evening, at an all-party meeting called by Karnataka governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala to take stock of the Covid-19 pandemic situation in the state, the issue of lockdown was first broached by former chief minister and JD(S) floor leader HD Kumaraswamy who said the government has no option but to enforce lockdown in the state.

BENGALURU: The state government, soon after the all party meeting on Tuesday, declared a weekend âcurfewâ by shutting down all non-essential services from 9pm on Friday till 6am on Monday to control the spread of the Covid-19 virus till May 4.

On other days, the curfew timing has been extended from 9pm to 6am, except for essential services.

As per the stringent measures announced by the government in a late night government order, the state has said that barring all essential services which include state and central government offices dealing with essential services, industries and companies requiring to function 24/7, employees and vehicles of telecom and internet service provides, patients and their attendants requiring emergency care, all other activities shall be barred in the state for the duration.

The order says that neighbourhood shops dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, fish and mutton stalls shall be open only between 6am to 10am, with restaurants being allowed to only cater to home delivery or take aways between Friday night till Monday morning.

The movement of essential services will be allowed only on producing valid ID proofs.

The government, in its order, has also reverted to old norms of allowing only 50 people for a marriage function with covid appropriate behaviour while restricting the number of people attending funerals and cremations to 20.

Earlier, on Tuesday evening, at an all party meeting called by governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala, the issue of lockdown was first broached by former chief minister and JD(S) floor leader H D Kumaraswamy who said the government has no option but to enforce lockdown in the state.

âDespite the November 2020 report warning of the second wave, the state was rather unprepared and is now overwhelmed by the number of cases. Now these cases cannot be controlled with the enforcement of night curfews, as is evident with the rising cases. I am afraid that there is no option but to enforce a lockdown in the present circumstances to put brakes on the Covid-19 spread,â he said.

Echoing similar thoughts but refraining from asking the government to enforce a âlockdownâ, opposition leader Siddaramaiah and even KPCC president D K Shivakumar suggested that the government must implement the technical advisory committee (TAC) recommendations in totality.

âWhile stern measures need to be taken to control the spread of the virus, we should also keep in mind that there is a need to protect the livelihood of people. So any decision of the government needs to be taken in consultation with experts and the ground realities,â said Shivakumar.

At the meeting, the issue of lockdown was backed by several other leaders including the legislative council chairman Basavaraj Horrati and even governor Vala.

However, Horrati deferred over a complete lockdown as it will hurt the movement of people and said that it should be implemented for only on weekends.

The governor, on the other hand, said the more important issue on hand is to have a âhealthy Karnatakaâ and that if it merits to have a lockdown to ensure this then so be it.

Responding to these thoughts, CM Yediyurappa, who joined via video conference from the hospital, said he has taken serious note of the suggestions given by the opposition leaders and will have a final round of discussions with the bureaucracy and the TAC on whether a lockdown is mandated or in what other manner can a âlockdownâ be enforced.

Home minister Basavaraj Bommai and revenue minister R Ashoka, briefing the media said that the measures like lockdown or otherwise stern action will be notified shortly.

âMore importantly, we need the support of the people in implementing any and every action,â said Ashoka.

With no help coming from the War Room’s helpline, doctors say they are left with no option but to organise oxygen supplies from the black market, paying as much as ten times the price of oxygen.Many private hospitals have not received oxygen supplies for three days and have shifted most of their patients to other hospitals with oxygen facilities. Swastik Hospital owner, Dr Vijay Raghav Reddy shifted some of his ICU patients to bigger hospitals to meet their oxygen needs. He had to manage about 10 patients at his own hospital.He said, “I had been appealing to the government to give us oxygen but it has been three days and nothing has been done. Though the minister said tonnes of oxygen was being supplied to the city, nothing is reaching small hospitals like ours. When I reached out to the War Room, they were not able to help me. I had to arrange the oxygen by myself.”Talking about how the dealers were making the most of it by supplying oxygen to other dealers instead of hospitals for a better price, he said, “With no option, I had to purchase oxygen in the black market for ten times its actual price. The dealers agreed to supply oxygen only with cash. I have 90 cylinders for which I used to pay Rs. 60,000 to fill enough oxygen to last me for one day. Now I have to pay Rs. 6 lakh for the same amount. This will last us for 24 hours. I’m hoping that the government does something about this by then.”Dr, MD of Athreya hospital in Anekal and president of, Anekal said that there are about 25 hospitals in Anekal with 200 patients who are on oxygen support and all of them might lose their lives within a few hours as none of the hospitals has managed to get oxygen supplies. “We have patients whose SPO2 is just 75 and we are not able to provide them with oxygen. We are in tears and helpless, watching our patients struggle and clutching on to empty cylinders next to them. They fear the cylinders will be taken away. Despite us telling the patients that they are empty and we are trying to arrange for another cylinder, they are unable to understand. That’s how badly they’re traumatised,” he said.He continued, “On Sunday, we had a meeting with, Medical Education and Health Minister, who promised us that the issue would be sorted and we would receive oxygen.It has been over 24 hours and nothing has been done so far. The War Room seems like a token facility. We’re getting no help and they’re just sharing contacts that don’t lead anywhere.Small private hospitals and nursing homes are suffering while the big hospitals are benefitting the most. With big hospitals striking deals with dealers to purchase the oxygen in the black market, we are left with nothing and our patients are dying. Those patients who can afford treatment in big hospitals are shifting there while the rest are slowly dying in our hospital beds. We are completely helpless.”Dr Narayanaswamy said that the family members had been falling at the feet of doctors to save their kin but the doctors have not been able to get any help from the government or the War Room.Several doctors who didn’t want to reveal their identity toldthat when they contacted the War Room, they were told to speak directly to the oxygen dealers.Attempts to reach Javed Akthar, Princi­pal Secretary, Health Depar­tment proved unsuccessful.","BENGALURU: The Congress party on Tuesday termed the all party meeting called for by governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala on Covid-19 pandemic as âunconstitutionalâ and termed it as an âinterferenceâ of Raj Bhavan in the administration of Karnataka At the meeting of all political party leaders, opposition leader Siddaramaiah started his talk by claiming the meeting called for by the Governor is âunconstitutionalâ.âAt the outset I state my objection to the meeting called for by the Governor as it is unconstitutional and can be perceived to be an interference in the administration of the state,â said Siddaramaiah.The former CM reminded the BJP administration that the Governor does not have the authority to execute any decisions and thus made the meeting called for by him redundant.âI do not know whether CM B S Yediyurappa has discussed this with the advocate-general but as far as I can understand the governor cannot take any executive decisions and every suggestion we give to him cannot be executed,â he said.Later, speaking to the media, KPCC president D K Shivakumar who was also part of the meeting echoed similar thoughts and said the meeting by itself suggests that there is a âgovernorâs ruleâ in the state.âThough the government has defended itself that it was a special circumstance, the meeting has shades of the governorâs rule in Karnataka,â he said.At the meeting, the Congress and JD(S) both took the government to task for lacking clarity in tackling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and said stern measures are inevitable.Shivakumar at the meeting suggested that the primary intent of the government should be to focus on saving lives and stop all development works to divert the funds towards medical needs.âAlso, the government must give priority to education and give a clarity to the students, parents and guardians about their future, cause there is no definitive decision taken with regard to examinations or the upcoming academic year,â he said.Siddaramaiah urged the government to declare pandemic in the state as a health emergency and also sought a national disaster tag to secure more funds from the centre to tackle the pandemic.Kumaraswamy and his brother, former minister, H D Revanna also demanded that the government tackle the pandemic head-on and provide proper facilities to those in need apart from financial assistance to the people dependent on daily wages and likely to be hit by the stern measures which the government takes.","BENGALURU: In a major relief to Bengalureans, the Centre on Tuesday greenlighted the long-pending Outer Ring Road-Kempegowda International Airport Metro corridor.Speaking to reporters after a Union cabinet meeting, railway minister Piyush Goyal said: âThe government has approved Bengaluru Metro âs Phase 2A from Central Silk Board Junction to KR Puram and Phase 2B from KR Puram to Kempegowda International Airport via Hebbal Junction, spanning 58km in total. The project cost is Rs 14,788 crore.âThe line is crucial for the city as it will pass through its IT corridor housing several multinational companies as well as areas like Silk Board, Bellandur, Marathahalli, KR Puram, Nagawara, Hebbal, Yelahanka and KIA. âThe project will streamline the urban transportation system in Bengaluru, which is stressed due to intensive developments, increase in the number of private vehicles and heavy construction putting stress on travel infrastructure and industrial activities, and provide the people safe, secure, reliable and comfortable public transport,â a statement issued by the central government said.Welcoming the decision, chief minister B S Yediyurappa said this will enhance the ease of living for citizens by decongesting Bengaluru.Union minister for housing and urban affairs (independent charge) Hardeep Singh Puri said: âOnce completed in the estimated 54 months, this project will play a key role in decongesting the city, which contributes 40% to Indiaâs IT exports and is home to a large number of IT parks, hubs & industries, many of which are located on the route.ââThis connectivity...will ease traffic congestion on roads leading to the airport. It will also contribute to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions,â he added.BMRCL had prepared a detailed project report for ORR Metro in 2016 at a cost Rs 4,202 crore and it was to be operational by 2021. However, the plan was deferred as the project didnât get clearance. The agency is now planning to make it operational by 2025-2026."
"With 1,881 more testing positive, active case pool rises to 9,027 in the district

The district's COVID-19 graph rose further on Wednesday with 1,881 more people testing positive for the virus.

The number marks the highest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases in the district. Although 552 recoveries also were reported on Wednesday, the active case pool has risen to 9,027. The death toll in the district stands at 929.

Of the new cases, local transmission accounted for 1,524. The number of healthcare workers getting infected also appears to be on the rise in the district. On Wednesday alone, 10 health workers tested positive, according to the official data. Health officials said that 3,067 persons have been newly quarantined in the district, taking the total number in quarantine to 34,390.

Ambulances with oxygen

Two ambulances equipped with oxygen supply have been deployed in the district as part of the COVID-19 preventive measures, District Collector Navjot Khosa said. The vehicles will be available to COVID-19 patients in emergencies, she added.

The district administration has appointed two nodal officers for coordinating ambulance services. Ajayakumar (Mobile no: 9497001178) is the nodal officer and Dr. Stanley (9846083994), the charge officer, for the Thiruvananthapuram, Neyyatinkara and Kattakada taluks. K. P. Jayakumar (9447027556) and Dr. Ajesh (9496466891) are the nodal officer and charge officer respectively for the Nedumangad, Chirayinkeezhu and Varkala taluks.

The public can also call 1077, 0471-2477088, 2471088 or 9188610100 for the service.

The State’s current daily requirement of medical oxygen is estimated at 74.25 metric tonnes, while the State’s daily oxygen production is 219.22 metric tonnes. This would be augmented as the requirement was rising, the Chief Minister said here on Wednesday.

As medical oxygen is one of the most critical elements of COVID-19 care, Kerala has also set up an expert committee to monitor the oxygen situation daily and to advise the government on how to manage the situation without falling into a crisis.

Kerala has also enhanced the health system's surge capacity by adding more ICU beds and doubling the number of ventilators it had during the first wave of COVID-19. Private hospitals have been asked to work with the government and to set apart 20% of their beds for COVID-19 care.

In both private and public sector, the State now has 9,735 ICU beds, of which 999 are occupied. The public sector ICU beds number 2,650, the current occupancy is 50% and this included both COVID-19 and other patients.

The number of ventilators in public and private sector together is 3,776, of which, 277 are occupied by COVID-19 patients. The number of ventilators in government hospitals alone comes to 2,253, of which the occupancy is 18.2%.

Apart from the 1,99,256 beds arranged in first and second line treatment centres, 136 private hospitals have made available 5,713 hospital beds for COVID-19 care.

The State has also drawn up a plan to augment this, if required, in the coming days.","For the second day running, the Kochi city police probing the alleged murder of a 13-year-old continued evidence collection with the sole accused and the victim’s father Sanu Mohan.

After taking him to his apartment at Karingachira and Muttar River where the body of the girl was found, the investigation team on Wednesday took him to Tamil Nadu where he had gone initially after giving the police a slip. This was part of recreating the entire trail the accused followed after allegedly murdering his daughter.

The accused was caught on CCTV footage crossing over to Tamil Nadu through Walayar checkpost, which incidentally was the first information the police had about him since the body of the girl was found in the river a day after he had reportedly taken her in an unconscious state from their apartment.

He was reportedly taken to Coimbatore where he allegedly sold off his car to fund his life in hiding. Places where he is suspected to have stayed were also visited.

The police would also have to take him to the neighbouring Karnataka as well where also he stayed during his almost month-long life on the run. In fact, he was picked up from Karwar in Karnataka the night after CCTV footage emerged of him passing through a street in the temple town of Kollur. He may also be taken to Bengaluru and Pune, where he had run a business and allegedly piled up considerable debt and has even a cheating case against him.

Sources said that the police are also looking into his claim that he had tried to end his life while on the run while evidence to piece together the truth behind his conflicting statements will also be sought.

Mystery grows

Meanwhile, the mystery behind the presence of alcohol found inside the girl’s body continues as the accused reportedly was yet to admit having fed her alcohol.

The police custody of the accused will end on April 29 and the police are rushing to complete the evidence collection before that.","With 379 recoveries, district has 10,878 active cases

The district on Wednesday recorded the highest single-day surge in COVID-19 cases with 2,140 persons testing positive for the viral infection.

Of the fresh cases, 2,119 persons contracted the virus through local transmission. Among the local bodies, Kottayam municipality continued to lead the table with 235 cases, followed by Ramapuram with 101 cases. The test positivity rate, meanwhile, stood high at 24.75%.

With 379 recoveries during the day, the district currently has 10,878 active cases while 25,859 persons are under surveillance.

Two sources

According to District Collector M. Anjana, majority of the fresh cases were reported among people who attended various functions or among family members. “Two more spots where the virus has spread through the same route will soon be declared as clusters,” the official said.

As part of enforcing the COVID-19 protocol, 84 sectoral magistrates have been appointed.

Vaccination

Taking note of the chaos over the distribution of vaccine in the district, the authorities have decided to regulate the crowd by administering doses to only those who register in the ‘cowin’ portal or the Arogyasethu app. Besides closing the window for spot registration, the mega vaccination camps in the district too have been closed down .

According to officials, the distribution of vaccine in Kottayam will now be carried out through 36 camps. Each venue will admit a maximum of 200 persons.

Tension at vaccination camp

The vaccination camp at Baker Memorial School in Kottayam witnessed some tense moments following an altercation between the public and the police. Though the authorities had announced their decision to limit the vaccine doses to those who have registered on the portal, people poured into the venue with the hope of carrying out spot registration. As the authorities tried to disperse the crowd, a section of people protested. The issue, however, was settled soon following the intervention of the local police. Though the authorities had made arrangements to distribute 1,000 doses, only 860 persons received the vaccine from the camp here during the day.","It will be operated by green army and volunteers of the health wing

The city Corporation has opened a COVID-19 control room for the public to reach out for any information regarding the pandemic. Mayor Arya Rajendran said that health supervisors would co-ordinate the activities of the control room, which will be operated by the green army and other volunteers working with the health wing of the Corporation. The control room can be contacted at 0471-2377702, 2377706

According to Corporation officials, the control room will also be a contact point for ambulance services, disinfection services for institutions and complaints regarding violation of COVID-19 protocols.

""Over the past few days, the Corporation has been constantly getting calls with a variety of doubts related to the pandemic protocol. Many people are confused as to whether their house is located in a containment zone or a micro containment zone and what it means if their area is declared as one. Some others call with doubts as to whether they can travel to another city during the night for important functions or meetings. People call with complaints of protocol violations too. The control room will have a support system to address all such queries and take steps if necessary. We will consider expanding the control room further based on the public response,"" said an official.

Less load

The Corporation had opened a control room last year as well after the pandemic outbreak. However, the load this time would be lesser as the Corporation is not running community kitchens, a major reason for the clarification calls last time. The rapid response teams in many of the wards have also been reactivated considering the increasing number of COVID-19 cases.

Meanwhile, only one vaccination camp could be organised by the Corporation on Wednesday due to the lack of vaccine supply. The Corporation has till Wednesday organised decentralised vaccination camps in around 40 wards, with the last one held in Mudavanmugal. There is a demand from councillors and the public from the other wards to organise camps there as well. With a supply of vaccine for the State expected to arrive by Wednesday night, the Corporation was hoping to organise camps in the remaining wards as well.","Call to let shops function 24/7 during Ramadan season

Instead of imposing time restrictions, merchant outlets in the State should be allowed to function round the clock in view of the Ramadan season, Mujeeb Rahman, State working president, Textile and Garment dealers Association, Kerala, has said.

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, he said more working hours meant less rush and hence less chance of COVID-19 spread. Ramadan shopping mostly takes place at night, and the new COVID protocol restraining shops from functioning beyond 9 p.m., would cause huge financial loss to the business community.

Mr. Rahman was part of a group of merchant organisation representatives led by the Calicut Chamber of Commerce and Industry that asserted that the business community was not to blame for the spread of COVID-19, while rallies by political parties remained unchecked ahead of the Assembly polls.

“The restrictions are being imposed in such a manner that they affect the merchant community seriously. The authorities are trying to create an impression that COVID-19 was spread by traders,” said Chamber president Zubair Kolakkadan.

The business community is not against the COVID-19 protocol. On the other hand, all business establishments should be allowed to function freely in keeping with the protocol. The public should be allowed to visit beaches and malls freely. But the authorities should make sure that the COVID-19 protocol is being followed and arrangements are made accordingly, he added.

Biju K., district vice president, Hotel and Restaurant Association, pointed out the thoughtlessness behind time restrictions on restaurants during Ramadan. “People come out of their homes only after breaking their fast, by around 7.30 p.m. If we have to close down by 9 p.m., what is the use of opening at all,” he asked.

C.E. Chakkunni, State president, All Kerala Consumer Goods Distributors’ Association, said the business community had suffered severe losses in the previous years owing to Nipah and floods, besides GST and demonetisation. “If they lose business in the coming season, most of them will not survive,” he said, adding that the government should compensate the loss facing small merchants from the GST collected.

Representatives of Cement Dealers Welfare Association and Textile Merchants Association were present at the press meet.","TPR 23.74%; Thrikkakara continues to report maximum number of infections

The number of new COVID-19 cases in Ernakulam has soared to an all-time high of 3,980 on Wednesday. The test positivity rate is 23.74%.

This is the second consecutive day that the district is reporting over 3,000 new cases and the day’s figure is the highest for any district in the State. A total of 16,759 samples were collected for testing.

The district’s active caseload is at 21,855. The figure has risen by about six times over the past two weeks, when compared with the figure of 3,383 people under treatment in the district on April 7.

Thrikkakara continues to report the maximum number of daily cases, with 173 people testing positive on Wednesday. This is followed by Thripunithura, where 119 people were infected, and Varapuzha where 108 people have tested positive. Vazhakulam recorded 101 new cases, while Cheranalloor saw 95 infections. Within Kochi Corporation limits, Palluruthy recorded 94 new cases, followed by Vyttila where 65 people tested positive, and Fort Kochi with 59 newly infected persons. Two health workers have also tested positive.

While 700 people tested negative on Wednesday, 50,523 people remain in quarantine. Fresh admissions to hospitals and other treatment centres stood at 186 on the day and 75 people were discharged.

A majority of people (16,229) recovering from the infection remain at home, while 986 patients are admitted at private hospitals. At the Government Medical College Hospital and PVS Hospital, where critically ill patients are admitted, 49 and 50 patients are recovering respectively. At other government hospitals, 115 people are admitted, 71 patients are at INHS Sanjivani, and 130 are at the CIAL COVID treatment centres. At first and second-line treatment centres, 245 people are being monitored for the infection.

Till Tuesday, Ernakulam has cumulatively reported 1,51,898 cases of the infection, and 482 people have succumbed to it, going by figures from the State Health Department dashboard.

Mass testing

The district is continuing with the mass testing drive that was launched last week to detect cases quickly and cut the risk of transmission. The drive aims to test people in professions that require them to be in close contact with people and 12,000 swabs were collected as part of the mass campaign on Wednesday, said a release from the district administration. The district’s test positivity rate has been rising since tests have been geared towards people who are more susceptible towards contracting the infection, according to Dr. S. Sreedevi, District Surveillance Officer.","Centre told to issue necessary guidelines to States

The Kerala CBSE School Managements’ Association has urged Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal to direct the State governments to commence the admission for degree/professional courses only after the publication of the results of the Class 12 examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The CBSE board examination for Class 12 has been postponed in view of the pandemic situation. Consequently, the publication of the results may be delayed. Meanwhile, the State governments are proceeding with the Class 12 examinations and the admission to the degree classes will start after the publication of the results, according to the letter sent by the association to the Minister.

CBSE students will lose their chance for admission to various degree/professional courses, if the admission is completed before the publication of the CBSE Class 12 results. To avoid such injustice to the CBSE students, we requested the Centre to direct the State governments to commence admission to degree/professional courses only after the publication of the CBSE Class 12 results, it said.

The letter stated that students and parents were anxious about the method of valuation and promotion of the Class 10 students after the examinations were cancelled in view of the pandemic. The association requested the Minister to ask the board to issue necessary guidelines to determine the promotion of the Class 10 students at the earliest.","533 persons contract infection through local contact

As many as 538 people, including two health workers, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Wayanad district on Wednesday.

Of the new cases, 533 persons contracted the infection through local contact. While one person returned from abroad, four came back from other States.

The district has so far reported 33,448 cases. Of them, 28,948 have recovered, including 89 persons on the day.

As many as 3,867 persons are under observation.","2,645 people test positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Wednesday

Fresh COVID-19 cases continued to hit new highs in Kozhikode when 2,645 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Wednesday.

The number of new infections has been going above 2,000 in the district for the past couple of days mainly as a result of the testing camps being held.

According to the District Medical Officer, the daily test positivity rate (TPR) is 21.05% when 13,176 samples were tested. There were 2,592 cases of local transmission of the infection, and the source of 52 others is not known. One person had returned from another State.

The Kozhikode Corporation accounted for 709 locally acquired infections, Kunnamangalam 84 and Olavanna 76. Active caseload of the district surged to 18,153.

Mass testing camps were held in the district for two days last week. Another round of the testing drive began on Wednesday. The Health Department is reportedly planning to test around 40,000 people in the course of two days.","Mega camp deferred; only those registered will get vaccine from today

Kozhikode was not exempted from COVID-19 vaccine shortage that hit other districts on Wednesday. The Health Department is learnt to have claimed that it had stock to last only till Thursday, and if fresh stock does not arrive, it could trigger a crisis. Mega vaccination camps have been postponed until further orders.

A mega vaccination camp scheduled in Koyilandy Municipality had to be cancelled, and chaos prevailed at the Cherooppa primary health centre for a while, as people thronged the premises in violation of the pandemic protocol. An official claimed that vaccine shortage was severe in the hilly areas of the district.

Earlier, the number of vaccination camps had to be reduced from 117 on Tuesday to 107, reportedly in view of the scarcity. According to sources, however, camps could be held only at 103 places on Wednesday. By Tuesday night, the department reportedly had a stock of only over 1,300 vials. But replenishment arrived later. Health officials claimed that 26,000 vials were used on Tuesday.

Sources said many people had thronged government-run vaccination camp sites without realising that only those who had registered with the COWIN portal could get the jab. People who wanted to have spot registration were left disappointed. Many senior citizens and those with co-morbidities had reached the centres early to have their second dose. Some of them were taken off guard by the rush.

At the Government General Hospital, Kozhikode, those who had registered on the portal were given the injection, apart from 200-odd others on a first-come-first-serve basis.

The rush for vaccines is reportedly driven by apprehensions about missing the second dose and also the rise in the number fresh cases in the past few days. Unruly scenes followed, and the police had to intervene in places such as Cherooppa. Physical distancing and the pandemic protocol were given a go-by.

Wednesday is actually marked for routine immunisation drives at all government healthcare institutions. From Thursday, only those who had registered with the portal will be given the jab.","Muraleedharan says vaccine centres have become virus transmission hubs

Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on Wednesday, said Kerala should use the Centre's new vaccine strategy to procure vaccines directly from manufacturers.

Kerala should also step forward to vaccinate citizens above the age of 18 freely. It should take its cue from Uttar Pradesh and Assam. The Petroleum and Explosive Organisation (PESO) has sufficient stock of medical oxygen to meet Kerala’s demand and then more, he said.

The Central government had delivered 62,42,833 doses to Kerala till April 21. Another six lakhs doses would reach State by April 25.

“The Kerala government still sought to blame the Centre for vaccine shortage,” he said.

He said the disparity between availability and allocation of COVID-19 vaccines had caused public order to break down at State-run inoculation centres in Kerala.

The Health Department had overreached itself.

It had allowed more citizens into vaccination centres without considering the number of shots it could administer.

“Kerala could deliver only less than 1 lakh doses a day. But it had invited double the number of citizens to State-run vaccination centres. The resultant anarchy turned the centres into virus transmission hubs,” he said.

He said the State’s political executive had gone on holiday after the elections. However, a warlike emergency gripped the country and State. The political leadership should take over the reins of COVID-19 management, he said.

Criticised

Mr. Muraleedharan drew sharp criticism from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) for his comment. CPI(M) acting State secretary said Mr. Muraleedharan had no moral right to criticise the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.

The administration had shielded the people from the ravages of the pandemic against long odds. Mr. Muraleedharan had not helped the State. Instead, he had only tried to tarnish Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and wreak political vengeance on the LDF. Mr. Muraleedharan was at the helm of the Centre’s relentless attempts to undermine the State government.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said the Centre had failed to reach sufficient doses free of cost to State governments. It had failed in its duty to protect the people. The Centre's new vaccine policy had caused an uptick in vaccine price. The cost of a single dose has risen from ₹250 to ₹600. The Centre has opened the field for unscrupulous private sector players to make most of the dire situation, he said.","All domestic travellers coming into State will undergo RT-PCR tests

The Health Department has revised its advisory for travellers coming into the State.

According to the revised guidelines, all domestic travellers coming into Kerala will undergo RT-PCR tests for SARS CoV-2, irrespective of their vaccination status and if found positive, will be treated according to the treatment protocols.

The high-risk primary contacts of the infected individual will compulsorily undergo room or institutional quarantine for 14 days and if they develop any symptoms, they should contact the Health Department’s DISHA helpline (1056) or the nearest health worker.

If they do not develop any symptoms, they will undergo RT-PCR testing on the eighth day. Even if tested negative, they should continue to be on quarantine for seven more days.

Low risk contacts of the infected individual should avoid unnecessary outings and social interactions and remain at home for 14 days. They should ensure that they wear a mask at all times and that hand and cough hygiene is maintained. Contact DISHA in the event of any symptoms.

Asymptomatic secondary contacts and people who have had any contact with people who have a history of travel within or outside the State should maintain all COVID-19 protocols.

All international travellers coming to the State should undergo the mandatory RT-PCR test as directed by the Union Health Ministry and remain in home isolation. Even if they test negative, they should be on self observation for seven days.

Business travellers to the State should register in the e-jagratha portal and produce a negative RT-PCR test result obtained within 48 hours. Those who have not done the RT-PCR test should undergo testing as soon as they reach the State and remain in room isolation till the test results are obtained.

If not undergoing RT-PCR test, they will have to remain in room quarantine for 14 days and contact DISHA if at all they develop any symptoms.","Mayor calls upon people to use online services

In view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases, the Kozhikode Corporation has imposed stringent restrictions at its office.

Mayor Beena Philip has asked the public to visit the corporation office only for essential requirements and to use online services wherever applicable. The link named ‘e-services’ on the website www.kozhikodecorporation.lsg.kerala.gov.in can be used to download birth, death and marriage certificates, to pay property tax, and apply for building permit (Suvega). One can also apply for social security pensions and marriage registration and ownership certificates through the link.

People can use the link ‘Public Grievance Cell’ on the same website to submit complaints. Complaints and applications can also be emailed to cltcorpcovidcrisis@gmail.com.

Besides, complaints can be deposited in the complaint box placed at the front office. The complainant should ensure that the contact number too is provided.

Members of the public who visit the corporation office due to unavoidable circumstances and extreme necessities shall approach the front office for guidance. They shall be allowed to the health wing from 10.15 a.m. to 1 p.m. and to the engineering and town planning wings from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Any fees, including taxes, shall be remitted at the Janasevana Kendram at the office. For fresh trade licences and their renewal, one should approach the respective health circle offices, a press release said.","With tighter pandemic restrictions, summer camps for kids seem a distant possibility

One of the casualties of the COVID-19 second wave has been children’s summer vacation camps. With classes going online last year and limited peer interaction, children’s mental and physical health suffered. With COVID-19 cases seemingly under control once, children had hoped to get away from the restricted environs at home, meet others of their age, and have fun, at least for a few hours a day. But now, as pandemic restrictions have been tightened, summer camps seem a distant possibility.

The Lakshmibai National College of Physical Education (LNCPE)at Karyavattom, which used to organise one of the biggest summer camps in the city with hundreds of children in attendance, said the COVID-19 protocols prevent it from organising such an event this year. However, there are plans to organise virtually some events for school and college students such as one on yoga that will not only educate them but also benefit them physically, says LNCPE Principal G. Kishore.

Creativity may be hit

D. Reghoothaman, co-founder of the Abhinaya Theatre Research Centre that conducts children’s theatre camps, says he has not been able to give a thought to a camp for children owing to the second wave of COVID-19. He is not comfortable with the idea of an online camp, saying shooting and sharing a session on social media changes the grammar of theatre. Theory classes could be held online, but children would not be very keen. Creativity would be affected if practical sessions were to be held online, he says.

Mampazhakalam, Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan’s annual summer camp, too will not be held this year. The Samskrithi Bhavan has been organising two cultural programmes a month, online, for the public in the wake of the pandemic. Other than that, no events are planned. Any decision on an online programme for children will depend on how the COVID-19 situation evolves, says Culture Director T.R. Sadasivan Nair.

Meanwhile, the Kerala State Jawahar Balbhavan’s summer camp has moved online. The camp, for children in the 4-16 age group, will be held till May-end, says institute principal S. Malini. Six live sessions a week are offered in three disciplines, and 500-odd children have registered.

Accustomed to online mode

Theatre director Prasanth Narayanan plans to start a camp for children on May 10. If possible, it will be held offline. Else, it will be organised online with all technical aspects in place. A live class through on online platform is what he has in mind. With children used to online classes now and availability of devices not a hurdle for most, the online mode should not be much of a hassle, he says.

The Institution of Engineers (India) that began a 25-day vacation class for students has put it on hold after six days. Though precautionary measures such as physical distancing, wearing of masks and temperature checks were in place, the increase in COVID-19 cases has prompted it to do a rethink. A review will be held on May 3 when a decision will be taken.

“We have a commitment to the 19 participants and will ensure they will gain something from the camp,” says V. Ganesan, Director of the Centre for Continuing Education and Consultancy Services.","Behera inaugurates ‘Pol-App’ to connect blood donors and recipients

The Kerala Police has introduced a new feature on its mobile application ‘Pol-App' for ensuring availability of blood in emergencies.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera inaugurated the new facility — Pol-Blood — facility in the app on Wednesday. Pol-App will henceforth serve as a platform for connecting blood donors and recipients.

Blood donors can download the app and register themselves on it. People who require blood can register on Pol-Blood by entering the blood group, unit, hospitals, blood bank and date. The Pol-App control room functions at the police headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram.

The new feature has been introduced with the support of the Kerala State AIDS Control Society. Pol-App can be downloaded from Google Play Store on Android and IOS platforms.

Pol-App was launched on June 10 and currently provides 27 services related to the police and has around three lakh users.

This was the first instance in the country where a State police force had arranged a mobile app for supporting blood donation, the State police said in a statement. ADGPs K. Padmakumar and Manoj Abraham and senior officers were present at the launch.","Pre-monsoon season has seen a severe shortage in pelagic fish catch, affecting livelihoods

Fishers have said that there is a ‘drought-like’ situation in the fishing sector, with pelagic fish catch falling drastically this season. “The fish scarcity has never been so severe,” said Jackson Pollayil of the National Fish Workers’ Forum, calling on the Union and State governments to undertake a scientific investigation into the phenomenon that has left thousands of fishers in dire straits.

The period just before monsoon is when fishers catch the bulk of pelagic fish. But this season has seen a severe shortage of fish, resulting in the fishing community suffering extensive losses, he said. “The government must study the cause for the fall in catch as well as on the methods and vessels being used by fishers,” he added.

‘Social catastrophe’

Charles George of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi, a trade union of traditional fishers, said the COVID-19-induced lockdown and subsequent restrictions had delivered a big blow to fishers who make a living by day-to-day operations. The rising cost of fuel and the restricted fishing days have been huge setbacks in the recent times.

He said the government should address the issues of sustainability, livelihood, and marketing of the catch. The issue of a severe fall in catch should be addressed. He claimed that oil sardine landing during 2019-20 had fallen to about 35,000 tonnes. This is a ‘social catastrophe’ and a serious livelihood issue, he added.

Trawling ban

Meanwhile, the All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators’ Association has written to the Union government that the move to extend the monsoon trawling ban, usually in place from June 1 and July 31, to 61 days would severely affect the mechanised fishing sector. The fishing ban for a ‘long period’ of 61 days would worsen the already precarious financial position of more than 3.5 lakh people directly and indirectly engaged in this sector, the boat operators said.

The Union government had reduced the ban period to 47 days on appeal from the fishing community but the Kerala government extended it to 52 days last year. The ban came immediately after the restrictions imposed by the State to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Bid to renew licence using official ID and password

The cyber cell of the Kozhikode City police has zeroed in on suspected persons who unlawfully tried to log in to the official portal of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), parivahan.gov.in, for renewal of an expired driving licence, using the official ID and password.

It was in the first week of March that the illegal login attempt was noticed by the department. And, the matter was reported to the police.

The alleged trickery was first noticed by a motor vehicle inspector after receiving an SMS alert indicating the login attempt after duty hours. It was soon reported to the Regional Transport Officer. The IP address of the website was tracked along with the licence details of the applicant to support the police inquiry.

Officials said the attempt was reportedly made by a third party agency on behalf of an actor from the city to clear online proceedings using the illegally accessed official ID and password. Though the actor claimed innocence, further action will be taken by the police on completion of inquiry, they added.","Damaged windrow composting sheds root cause of malfunctioning of facility: report

The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has warned the Kochi Corporation that the leachate from the old waste heaps at the civic body’s Brahmapuram yard would run into the nearby Kadambrayar river with the arrival of the monsoon.

A report filed by the board before the State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management pointed out that the sheds provided for windrow composting were in a dilapidated stage. Waste was seen dumped in the open yard. There was every chance of heavy leachate flow during rainy season for which proper collection facility was not provided, it said.

The board, which held inspections at the yard in February and March, stated that the damaged windrow composting sheds were the root cause of the malfunctioning of the solid waste management facility. No effective facilities were seen there to process fresh biodegradable waste collected from the corporation area as well as from other local bodies.

Rainwater will definitely come in contact with the deposited legacy waste and will be directed to the Kadambrayar. There were visible discharge routes intentionally constructed for this untreated sewage discharges that find its way to the marshy area beyond the sheds before reaching the river. A branch of the Chitrapuzha located close to the site was also facing the threat of untreated waste water from the yard entering it, according to the report.

The board found that the septage treatment facility was not functioning properly. It is suspected that untreated or partially treated sewage/effluent was discharged into the nearby marshy area located approximately 50 metres away from the septage plant. Sewage in septic condition was seen spread over the entire area.

The report said that it was distressing to note that almost all components of the septage treatment plant were seen kept idle. There was clear evidence of untreated sewage discharge using flexible hose directly into the marshy area, which remains connected to the Chitrapuzha. It was noticed that fresh biodegradable waste received in the plant was not properly segregated and disposed as such even though separate records were kept as per the type of waste reaching the yard, according to the report.","Parents, psychologist fear lack of early-school experience due to the COVID-19 pandemic may hamper development of children

Parents of five-year-old Maidhili Krishna have been at pains explaining to her why she can’t dance or sing before an audience like her elder sister Meenakshi did a couple of years ago.

The pandemic, which stripped her of the fun-filled lower kindergarten (LKG) year and reduced it to online sessions, now threatens to consume the upper kindergarten days as well, leaving her father Krishnakumar Menon worried about what it means for his little daughter emotionally.

“We are trying to make up for her loss by creating a school-like atmosphere at home though it’s a very pale compensation. Missing out on the exposure and the foundations that helped her elder sister is indeed a big loss for her,” he rues.

Loss of social skills

Narendar Ananda Bhat, a private company employee in the city, is similarly worried for his three-year-old daughter Tanmaya, who in normal times should have been having fun at playschool. “The gap in academics could perhaps be bridged but not the loss of interactions in a peer group,” he lamented.

Shirley Somasundaram, theatre personality and principal of the KG section of Vidyodaya School, observed that the loss of social skills in formative years could pose problems later.

“There is no compensation for the loss of classroom atmosphere. No matter how effective the online sessions are, the child remains the centre of attraction in a household that pampers its ego unlike in school where it is nipped bit-by-bit as the child learns to be part of a group. It will be teachers in higher classes who will find it really tough to manage these children deprived of crucial foundational skills. We will have to design modules for them over and above the curriculum,” she said.

A positive fallout

Ms. Somasundaram, however, felt that the pandemic-induced online sessions that demanded increased involvement of parents had a positive fallout of helping them realise that it was after all possible to find time for their children.

V. Sudarshana Manoj, a counselling psychologist, feels that the gaps in formative years could hamper physical and mental development, besides social skills. “Since they are cut off from the larger society and their interactions are restricted to their immediate family, these children could later develop a social phobia and even panic attacks in social interactions. They may also suffer from personality disorders like anger management issues and lack of confidence and turn out to be extremely shy and introverted. Creating a congenial home atmosphere, breaking the islands in which parents and children find themselves in despite being together at home, remains the only feasible alternative,” she says.","He was allegedly murdered by brother, mother

A forensic team on Wednesday exhumed the mortal remains of Shaji Peter, a 44-year-old Yeroor resident who was allegedly murdered and buried by his brother and mother.

The Yeroor police had taken into custody Shaji’s brother Sajin Peter, mother Ponnamma and Sajin’s wife Arya on Tuesday after they received a tip-off about the murder. During interrogation, Sajin and his mother confessed to the crime that took place on the Onam day of 2018. Shaji, an accused in several theft and assault cases, has been missing for two and a half years and his family had created an impression that he relocated to another place in order to evade arrest.

Following a quarrel

According to the police, the murder took place when Sajin and his wife visited Shaji and Ponnamma at their house in Bharathipuram. A quarrel broke out between the siblings when Shaji tried to attack Ponnamma and Arya and in the ensuing clash he sustained severe head injuries. Reportedly, Sajin hit an inebriated Shaji with an iron rod and when they realised he was dead, Sajin and his mother buried the body on the premise. The grave near the well was later sealed with concrete. Since the house stands in the middle of a vast rubber plantation with no other houses nearby, it was easy to bury the body without anyone noticing it.

A tip-off

It was a relative, a cousin of the deceased, who informed the police after he came to know about the incident during a recent visit. A resident of Pathanamthitta, he gave a statement before the Pathanamthitta Dy.SP who alerted the Yeroor police and the three accused were taken into custody on Tuesday. Sajin and Ponnamma have been booked under section 302 of Indian Penal Code for murder while Arya will face charges for destroying evidence and giving false information to screen the offenders.","Rail traffic between Shoranur and Kozhikode hit

The timely detection of a dangerous crack on the railway track at Mannur near Kadalundi by local residents averted a major disaster on Wednesday. It was around 7 a.m. that they spotted the cracked line, and they immediately alerted the Railways.

Police personnel and railway engineers who visited the spot said the crack was very serious in nature, and that it was the timely intervention of local residents that helped the Railways manage the situation. They said nothing suspicious was found at the spot.

The incident hit traffic between Shoranur and Kozhikode. According to the Feroke police, the route was cleared within a few hours. The railway engineering team also conducted a thorough inspection.","Hostels have ventured into efforts to adopt sustainable practices such as source-level segregation of waste materials

Despite having no consolidated system for waste collection, the Karyavattom campus of the University of Kerala has been witnessing localised efforts in moving towards green protocol of late.

Following the footsteps of various study departments that managed to transform themselves into zero-waste institutions, hostels at the campus have also ventured into efforts to adopt sustainable practices such as source-level segregation of waste materials.

The women researchers’ hostel, one of the five hostels in the campus, has successfully undertaken a plastic collection drive that has enabled its authorities to prevent plastic burning on its backyard. Through the ‘pilot project’, the hostel that has 129 inmates could collect over 1,500 plastic covers from the rooms as well as the hostel mess within a month.

According to hostel secretary Vinumol Devassy, a research scholar, plastic covers were collected, washed and dried floor-wise. Sanitary workers later collected these on a weekly basis. A large number of medicine covers, brushes and plastic bottles were also collected separately. The waste items also comprised numerous hand sanitiser containers.

‘Green’ Vishu

“Despite teething problems, the endeavour has made inmates conscious against littering irresponsibly. The washed and dried plastics, which otherwise would have been burnt, were packed and handed over to the plastic waste collection centre run by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in Kazhakuttom,” she said.

The first signs of change were visible recently when the hosteliers opted for a ‘green’ Vishu by avoiding the use of plastic leaves and disposable glasses for the sadhya.

The hosteliers have now recommended a centralised system to manage plastic wastes from the five university hostels that houses around 800 postgraduate students and researchers. A nodal officer was also vital for monitoring the mechanism and constantly evaluating its progress. The students also mooted a total ban on plastic burning inside the Karyavattom campus.","Civic body says it is being targeted by Pollution Control Board

The Kochi Corporation has carried out several works to improve the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram, according to the authorities.

The treatment of leachate would not be a problem even in monsoon as the septage treatment plant has the capacity to store about 1 lakh litres. The leachate generated is collected in the one-lakh litre capacity collection tank behind the compost plant through a network of drains, pointed out the Secretary of the civic body in its reply to the notice issued by the State Pollution Control Board.

The civic body admitted that the plant roof had collapsed, but heaping and composting of waste was being carried out at the site. No leachate was flowing into the Kadambrayar and Chitrapuzha. A one-lakh litre capacity tank constructed behind the plant collects all the leachate from the plant through a network of drains constructed around the compost plant. The collected leachate is taken to the septage treatment facility of the corporation and treated there. There is no draining of leachate into the Kadambrayar, it said.

There are many industrial establishments in the upstream portion of the Kadambrayar in Brahmapuram itself. The board is remaining discreet on this issue. There are physical evidence of such industrial units draining their toxic effluent into the Kadambrayar without any treatment. Without established data on the water quality of the Kadambrayar at the downstream and upstream portion of the solid waste treatment plant, it is to be inferred that the board is targeting and blaming only the corporation’s solid waste treatment plant for polluting the river, it alleged.","Plantation workers being tested every three days

In the wake of the rise in COVID-19 cases, the district administration has tightened checking at the border check-posts. Plantation workers arriving from Tamil Nadu daily are being tested for COVID-19 every three days. The mass testing at the check-posts will continue till Thursday.

District Collector H. Dinesan said that employees such as drivers and salespersons who interact more with the public should undergo tests at the nearby public health centres. Arrangements were in place at government hospitals and the availability of enough beds and oxygen was ensured.

20,000 vaccines

The facilities at Government Medical College Hospital, Idukki, and district hospital, Thodupuzha, were being reviewed. He added that 20,000 more COVID-19 vaccines had arrived in the district.

District Police Chief R. Karuppusami said that 750 police officers had been deployed on special COVID-19 duty. They will check shops, buses, and private vehicles. Those coming through the border areas in Kumily, Cumbom Mettu, Bodimettu, and Chinnar should have COVID-19-negative certificate. Arrangements were also being made to conduct tests for those without the negative certificates, he said.","‘Employees facing tremendous pressure due to non-banking work’

Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) has demanded that bank managements put an end to non-banking business and focus on banking for the welfare of banks and their employees.

Speaking in the backdrop of the death of a woman officer, BEFI State general secretary S.S. Anil said employees were working under tremendous pressure owing to non-banking work. He blamed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for giving silent permission to banks to undertake such work.

BEFI joint secretary N. Meena said the officer who allegedly took the extreme step was not the first to do so due to work pressure. She added that several officials had opted for voluntary retirement owing to intolerable work demands.

Mr. Anil pointed out that many of the reforms in the banking sector were unscientific. Shortage of staff, lack of basic facilities, irrational targets, and unnecessary interventions by senior officials were destroying employee morale, he said.

While banks have been entrusted with implementing Central projects such as Jan Dhan Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyothi Bima Yojana, and Atal Pension Yojana, employees have additional responsibilities of life insurance, general insurance and medical insurance schemes and mutual funds.

Besides, there are separate targets for deposits, loans, NPA, and recovery. As a result, employees are susceptible to severe mental stress, Mr. Anil said.

BEFI has appealed to the Union Finance Minister to take a look at the matter, through a signature campaign. Federation district president K.T. Anil Kumar and secretary V.R. Gopakumar were present.","Court says to support a tax, legislative sanction essential

Holding that nothing can be realised by way of tax or anything akin thereto which has not been authorised by the legislature, the Kerala High Court has set aside a 2009 government order imposing cess on industries for extracting water from rivers for industrial use.

Justice N. Nagaresh passed the verdict while allowing writ petitions filed by FACT and two private companies against levying of cess on use of water from rivers for industrial use.

The court observed that Article 265 of the Constitution of India provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law. Tax, duty, cess, or fee were levied by the State government to raise revenue for the State. In fact, each expression denoted different kinds of “imposts” depending on the purpose for which they were levied. This power could be exercised in any of its manifestations only under any law authorising levy and collection of tax as envisaged under Article 265.

Right to regulate use

The court noted that section 3 of the Kerala Irrigation and Water Conservation Act, 2003, provided that the State government was entitled to conserve and regulate the use of such watercourses and water in all such watercourses. As power was conferred on the State government to regulate watercourses for the purpose of irrigation and water conservation, the government would be perfectly within its powers to regulate or curb lifting of water from such watercourses for industrial purposes, as unrestricted usage of water for industrial purposes could adversely affect the availability of sufficient quantity of water for irrigation purpose.

However, “the impost of tax/cess/fee/rate” stands on a different footing. The executive could not levy tax. To support a tax, legislative sanction was essential. It cannot be levied and collected in the absence of any legislative sanction, by exercise of executive power of the State under Article 162. A statutory source of power was lacking in the present case, the court observed.","They want easing of curbs on tourists, aid package for the sector

The tourism fraternity in Kerala will observe May 1 as Black Day to pressure the State government to resolve the problems faced by the sector due to the restrictions imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Tourism Samrakshana Samithi, an umbrella body of 20 organisations, will observe the Labour Day Statewide this time by wearing black masks. A social media campaign #SaveTourism too will be launched.

Even entities generating some revenue out of tourism are in dire straits, according to the forum. Tourism has been a mainstay of the Kerala economy, generating ₹44,000 crore annually and providing 15 lakh jobs. However, the sector has been struggling in the past 14 months, the Samithi says.

The second wave of COVID-19 has led the administration to impose further travel restrictions. Of the 18,000 people who tested COVID-positive recently, only 269 were from outside Kerala — and none of them was in the State as tourists. Workers in the sector have been strictly following the COVID-related protocols.

Samithi convenor Sudheesh Kumar says its demands include providing ₹5,000 a month to the jobless in the sector, a package aiding the workers involved in tourism, exemption from taxes and fees for tourist vehicles and houseboats, and moratorium on tax arrears.

An immediate financial package of ₹250 crore to support the tourism workers, financial aid as loan worth ₹2,500 crore through the Kerala Bank and restructuring of all bank loans in tourism sector are the other demands.

GST moratorium

The organisation has also sought easing of restrictions on tourist movements and a 24-month moratorium on GST. RT-PCR test should not be made compulsory for those visiting Kerala and returning, it says.","Row over complaint against Sudhakaran refuses to die down

The CPI(M) Alappuzha unit has found itself in a predicament over recent controversies involving its leaders.

Last week, wife of Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran’s former personal staff member lodged a police complaint alleging that the Minister’s remarks at a press conference in Alappuzha on April 11 were damaging to womanhood and could provoke communal tension.

While the complainant has been identified as a former Students Federation of India Alappuzha district committee member, her husband is the Purakkad local committee member of the CPI(M), who was ousted from the Minister’s staff a few months ago.

After showing initial reluctance, the Ambalappuzha police recorded statements of the petitioner after she stood firm on her complaint despite “pressure to withdraw the petition”. The police have not yet registered a case based on the complaint.

Factional feud

It has been alleged that the complaint against the Minister was the result of “growing factional feud” in the party’s district unit. Mr. Sudhakaran, who denied denigrating womanhood, said the allegations against him were the handiwork of “political criminals”.

Although the party district leadership has rallied behind Mr. Sudhakaran, the controversy has refused to die down.

CPI(M) district secretary R. Nazar termed the allegations against the Minister baseless. He also refuted reports that Mr. Sudhakaran was inactive during the Left Democratic Front’s campaigning for the Assembly polls.

FB post controversy

Even as the party is grappling with the police complaint against one of its senior leaders in the district, its Kayamkulam MLA U. Prathibha has landed in a controversy after an old Malayalam proverb appeared on her Facebook page on Tuesday night that loosely translates to ‘God would punish those who seek to harm innocent people’.

Many on social media saw it as a jibe at Mr. Sudhakaran. Others said she was expressing her sentiments after being betrayed by a section of the party in the Assembly polls in Kayamkulam. The post was later removed from the page.

Ms. Prathibha, however, denied posting the comment and said her Facebook account had been “hijacked”. She later filed a police complaint.","Playback singers in Kerala get royalty for the first time

Singer Devanand will soon receive a payment of ₹6,000 from the Indian Singers’ Rights Association (ISRA). The amount may not be much, but it is significant – because it is the first ever he is getting as royalty.

“It feels nice that I have become eligible for getting royalty for the songs I have sung,” says Devanand, the singer of popular songs like Karimizhi kuruviye... (Meesha Madhavan). “It is a promising beginning and I hope it could become one of the sources of income in the future for singers like me.”

Like him, it is for the first time that the majority of the Malayalam playback singers are getting royalty. It was only in 2012 that the singers became eligible for royalty. Till then, only the composer and the lyricist used to get it.

ISRA members

“Singers like K.J Yesudas and K.S. Chithra had become members of the ISRA earlier so they have been paid from 2017 onwards,” says Sanjay Tandon, CEO, ISRA. “This time around, some 60 singers from Kerala will benefit for the first time.”

He adds it is only the beginning. “The amount will increase greatly once radio stations, television channels and OTT platforms begin to pay royalty to the singers,” he says. “Our lawyers are negotiating with them, but it may take some time.”

Seasoned playback singer G. Venugopal says he is glad that the money is being released during the tough times of COVID-19. “Our singers have been making this demand from the onset of the pandemic, and it is good to know that ISRA has decided to distribute it now,” he says.

“Of course, there is much more to be done to make the people concerned – radio stations, television channels, OTT platforms – pay us what is due to us,” he adds.

Making them pay

Mr. Tandon says at the moment only a few sectors, such as hotels and restaurants, are paying royalty to singers. “That too, mostly in places like Mumbai and Delhi,” he says. “Hotels in Kerala and other parts of South India are not willing to pay, even if we are asking them for the lowest charged item on the menu or ₹2.15 per room, on yearly basis.”

He says the ISRA is paying ₹6000 each to all its 702 members from the ₹40 lakhs it collected. “Every member is eligible for this amount, it used to be ₹3,225 in 2017,” he says. “Besides, singers are also paid directly for their logged songs, which are played in events like the Indian Premier League cricket tournament.”","Only essential services will be allowed.

Kerala government is mulling near-total curtailment of civic life on weekends to slow down the transmission of the resurgent COVID-19 virus.

A top-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday reportedly weighed in, allowing only essential services to operate on April 24 and 25th.

It might even declare Saturday a government holiday.

The government is yet to call it a weekend lockdown.

However, it might request citizens to sequester themselves indoors as far as possible on Saturday and Sunday to drastically reduce the probability of virus spread.

Citizens can conduct marriages and housewarming ceremonies already registered on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal.

The police are likely to shut down weekend destinations, including parks, beaches and hill stations, which witness sizeable crowds on holidays, for the weekend.

The administration will scale down commercial activity. It might request traders to down shutters for 48 hours and close down markets and commercial hubs.

Kerala had on Tuesday imposed a night curfew (9 p.m. to 5 a.m.) till May 3.

An official says the meeting viewed the pandemic situation as grave. The State recorded 19,577 new cases on Tuesday.

Its test positivity rate hovered around 17.45 %.

It feared the virus surge might incrementally overwhelm the State's finite public health resources if not curbed immediately.

The meeting considered increasing the number of Covid-19 First-Line Treatment Centres (CFLTC), given the possibility of a virus mutant-driven disease surge.

Shortage of vaccine, the rising demand for hospital beds, ventilators, medical oxygen, anti-viral drugs and steroids has worried the administration.

A special health department task force will monitor ""infrastructure and capacity"" in health facilities across Kerala daily. The unit will report to the CM at 3.30 p.m. daily.

Public disquiet over vaccine scarcity is mounting. In Kottayam, the police had to placate citizens angered over the lack of vaccine doses.

Hence, the government might stop on-the-spot registration and urge citizens to book their vaccination slots online.

Mr. Vijayan has written to the centre for at least 50 lakh vaccine doses. He asked the centre to supply the medicine free of cost given the State's COVID-19 cratered finances.

Mr. Vijayan reportedly called for uniformity in pandemic related orders. Confusion over whether traders should down shutters at 7.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. had caused frayed tempers.

An official says the government might allow shops outside containment zones to operate till 9 p.m. However, malls and cinema halls should shutter at 7.30 p.m.

An official says a proposal to scale down attendance at government offices to 50 per cent is on the cards.

The government will emphasize work from home and urge the private sector to follow suit.

The administration has banned in-person tuition classes and summer camps. It has urged students and teachers to shift to online platforms.

The government has disallowed indoor dining in hotels in containment zones. It might further restrict the number of attendees at weddings and other social functions.

The government will raise a volunteer force, as it did in 2020, to aid health officials and local body representatives to manage the pandemic situation at the neighbourhood level.

The administration is considering mass vaccination camps for guest workers. Health inspectors will check their quarters and ensure their welfare.

The meeting also weighed distributing additional rations and food kits to the population.

Mr. Vijayan is likely to make a public announcement in the evening.","It is the only grama panchayat in Thrissur where BJP is in power

After much confusion and uncertainties, Avinissery grama panchayat has received a president and vice president following intervention of the High Court.

BJP members Hari C. Narendran and Geetha Sukumaran took the oath of office as president and vice president respectively on Tuesday. This is the second time the BJP is gaining power in the panchayat. Avinissery is the only grama panchayat in Thrissur district where the BJP is in power.

No absolute majority

No front gained an absolute majority in the 14-member panchayat council in the local body elections held last year. While the BJP got six seats, the LDF and the UDF won five and three seats respectively. In the absence of an absolute majority, the presidential election at the local body was delayed.

Though the LDF representatives were selected to the posts with the UDF support twice, they refused to take power.

Following this, Mr. Hari and Ms. Geetha approached the High Court, citing that the delay in the election of president and vice president was affecting the functioning of the panchayat. They pleaded with the court to post them as president and vice president.","It dismisses petition from former Minister as ‘without any merit’

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed a writ petition filed by K.T. Jaleel, former Minister for Higher Education and Minority Welfare, challenging the Lok Ayukta's order finding him guilty of abuse of power and nepotism in appointing his relative K.T. Adeeb to the post of general manager, Kerala State Minorities Finance Development Corporation, on deputation from a private bank.

Dismissing the petition, the Bench comprising Justice P.B. Suresh Kumar and Justice K. Babu observed that the Lok Ayukta was acting within the scope of its powers while arriving at its conclusion. The petitioner had not made out any ground for interference in the final opinion formulated by the Lok Ayukta .The writ petition, in the circumstances, was “without any merit and the same is accordingly dismissed in limine.”

Vigilant media

The court also observed that in spite of a vigilant media, it was a fact that abuse of public resources and position in public life for private gain were rampant in our State. Abuse of public resources or position in public life for private gain would certainly amount to corruption. The scope of corruption would increase when the control on the public administrators was weak.

The Bench pointed out that the contention of the petitioner that there was no investigation into the complaint by the Lok Ayukta was liable to be rejected.

The court noted that investigation contemplated under the Kerala Lok Ayukta Act, 1999 was only a formal inquiry to discover the truth of the allegation. The procedure for conducting the investigation in a given case was a matter for the Lok Ayukta or Upa Lok Ayukta, as the case may be, to decided having regard to the circumstances of the case. In fact, the materials indicated that the Lok Ayukta had afforded all the parties, including the petitioner, an opportunity to make oral submissions in this case.

The court added that materials also indicated that it was based on the facts disclosed in the written statements filed by the State government as also the petitioner and based on the facts disclosed in the files produced by the government that the factual conclusions in the report under Section 12(3) of the Act was arrived at.

Argument misconceived

The argument of the petitioner that the Lok Ayukta should have afforded the petitioner an opportunity to adduce evidence and should have collected additional materials making use of the mechanism provided under Section 16(3) of the Act was misconceived. Nor the petitioner had sought to adduce evidence.

The Lok Ayukta's order came on a complaint alleging that K.T. Adeeb, cousin of the former Minister, was illegally appointed as general manager of the corporation on a deputation. The Lok Ayukta had found that that the Minister's decision to change the qualification for the post of general manager by adding BTech with PGDBA as qualification for the post was to make his second cousin eligible for the post. The earlier qualification was graduation with MBA or CS/CA/ICWAI. As result, the Lok Ayukta had made a declaration that the petitioner was not entitled to continue as a Minister.","Agency had punched holes in investigations by Kerala Police

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which took over the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) espionage probe from the Kerala Police, had concluded that the allegations of espionage were not proved and found to be false.

The closure report, which was filed by R. S. Dhankar, Dy. Superiendent of Police (CBI/SIC.II), New Delhi, on April 30, 1996, attains significance in the wake of the Supreme Court asking the CBI last week to look into the D.K. Jain committee report on the alleged framing of space scientists Nambi Narayanan and others by the former police officials in the espionage case.

Besides debunking the espionage theory in its closure report filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, the CBI had also listed out the errors committed by three police officers, Siby Mathews, K. K. Joshua, and S. Vijayan during the course of the investigation.

The case

The infamous ISRO espionage case has its genesis in a case registered at Vanchiyoor Police station on November 13, 1994. Mr. Vijayan, who was the then inspector of the Special Branch, booked a case against Fauzia Hassan and Mariyam Rasheeda for violating the provisions of the Official Secrets Act.

In his written complaint, Mr. Vijayan stated that it was prima-facie indicated that Ms. Hassan and Ms. Rasheeda, in collusion with some others, took part in the activities prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity of India and harmful for the cordial relations between India and its neighbours.

Besides the two women and Mr. Narayanan, D. Sasikumaran, K. Chandrasekhar and Sudhir Kumar Sharma were also arrested in the case.

The CBI took over the investigation in December 4, 1994.

In its report, the CBI noted that the accused, when confronted with their statements to the Kerala police, stated that the statements were made under duress on suggested lines.

The CBI reported that no evidence came on record indicating that the accused indulged in espionage by passing on of secret documents of ISRO or of any defence establishments and no incriminating documents could be recovered.

It concluded that the statements of the accused recorded by the Kerala Police and the IB were mutually contradictory within themselves. In spite of the contradictions, the investigation was carried out presuming that the alleged disclosures made by accused were true and was treated as the basis for further investigation, the closure report concluded.","Active case load rising alarmingly, 1,18,673 patients under treatment

Kerala’s ride over the second wave of COVID-19 is proving to be quite agonising with the epidemic curve rising at an alarming pace, putting more and more people in hospital beds and ICUs on a daily basis.

On Tuesday, when the results of 1,12,221 samples, which are part of the first round of augmented testing came in, the State set another record in a single day’s spike, recording 19,577 new cases. The cumulative case burden of the State has now risen to 12,72,645.

The active case load is rising alarmingly and now has 1,18,673 cases.

There were also 3,880 recoveries taking the tally to 11,48,671. The test positivity rate seems more or less steady since the past three days at 17.45%.

Though the active case pool has over a lakh patients, at present, total hospital admissions number 13,221. On Tuesday, 2,470 persons were admitted to hospitals.

The proportion of critically ill patients requiring ICU care in the State has risen to 937, with the number of those requiring ventilator assistance rising to 277. This is a hike not seen during the first wave and by all indications, this is likely to climb further, putting immense pressure on the health system.

In almost all districts, ICU beds earmarked for COVID-19 patients are getting filled up fast and there is almost 60% to 70% occupancy in most hospitals.

The State added 28 new deaths to the official list on Tuesday. The cumulative toll has risen to 4,978.

Thrissur reported six deaths, Ernakulam four, Thiruvananthapuram, Palakkad, and Kannur three each, Kozhikode, Malappuram, and Kollam two each, while one death each was reported from Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha.

Among the districts, Ernakulam’s case graph shot through the roof on Tuesday, recording 3,212 cases, Kozhikode 2,341, Malappuram 1,945, Thrissur 1,868, Kottayam 1,510, Thiruvananthapuram 1,490, Kannur 1,360, Alappuzha 1,347, Palakkad 1,109, Kasaragod 861, Kollam 848, Idukki 637, Wayanad 590, and Pathanamthitta 459 cases.","Corpn. secretary asked to submit report on steps taken to solve issue

The Kerala State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has asked for an explanation from the Kozhikode Corporation on the water pollution in parts of Elathur ward of the civic body. Commission member K. Baijunath has asked the Corporation Secretary to submit a report on steps taken to solve the issue and future plans, within four weeks.

The Commission had suo motu registered the complaint based on newspaper reports on the issue. Councillor from Elathur Manoharan Mangariyil had raised the issue at the Corporation Council meeting on Monday and had sought the civic body’s intervention to find an effective solution.

According to him, the residents of about 400 houses in Mattuvayal, Padannayil and Azheekal areas of Elathur have been affected. The area is located between the railway line and the sea, close to the estuary of Korapuzha, and is filled with small streams that provide water and fish to the residents. However, post the tsunami in 2004, the structure of the land changed. A sand bund created near the estuary is blocking the flow of water into and from the streams. As a result, the water is stagnated and is filled with worms and waste. During the rain, the polluted water entered the courtyards of houses, said Mr. Mangariyil.

The Corporation used to find temporary solutions to the issue by splitting the sand bund and allowing the water to flow into the sea. But the bund would usually be formed again in a day. Mr. Mangariyil suggested to the Council that a new canal should be built in the region, opening into the river, so that the high tide and low tide would ensure free flow of water into the streams, thus purifying them. He highlighted the severe water scarcity in the region. Most houses in the area do not have wells as they are close to the coast. They depend on water supplied by the Kerala Water Authority. The age-old pipeline often bursts, resulting in water scarcity for weeks.

Mayor Beena Philip said the issue would be dealt with as soon as possible.

The Human Rights Commission has said that the people in the locality are planning a protest against the Corporation for its alleged indifference to the issue.","House-to-house testing in all panchayats with high TPR

Kerala has decided to rely on augmented mass testing for COVID-19 to track and isolate infectious persons in the community to put a break on the intense pace of disease transmission in the second wave of COVID in the State.

A high-level meeting convened by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy on Tuesday decided to intensify testing at the panchayat-level and to test everyone in those panchayats, where the test positivity rate (TPR) has been high. In all panchayats, where the TPR is more than double that of the district’s average TPR, house-to house every resident would be subjected to COVID testing.

The success of the first round of augmented mass testing in the community, which picked up close to 75,000 positive persons in the community out of over three lakh samples, in a space of three days, seems to have convinced the State that mass testing was the way forward to bring down transmission rate.

Second round

The second round of augmented testing, with a target of collecting three lakhs samples, will be done over Wednesday and Thursday.

The strategy now is to continue mass testing rigorously across districts in the hoped that the State’s current TPR of over 17% can be brought down to 3 %.

The government has also decided to conduct SARS CoV2 genomic studies to understand the virus transmission dynamics in the State."

"Contamination and wastage could affect efficacy, says affidavit

The Central government told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that door-to-door vaccination for the COVID-19 virus is not possible as it was expected to lead to contamination and wastage.

Satyendra Singh, Under Secretary in the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, filed his affidavit and listed reasons for not being able to provide a door-to-door facility.

The affidavit read, “In case of any Adverse Event Following Immunisation, case management may not be proper and there will be delay in reaching the health facility and challenges in maintaining protocol of observation of the patient for 30 minutes after vaccination. There were chances of contamination as during door-to-door inoculation, the vaccine container will be taken out at each house, which could affect its efficacy.”

The affidavit mentioned, “There was also the possibility of high wastage as inoculation drive will take longer. At the request of State governments, more vaccination centres have been approved with special consideration for senior citizens.” As to the registration for vaccination, it informed that people could register in advance or on site.

The reply was submitted in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by two city-based lawyers who sought those above 75 years, bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound may be vaccinated at home.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni is expected to hear the PIL on April 22.","Mr. Pawar underwent a follow-up procedure at the Breach Candy hospital on Tuesday late night.

The Vashi police, acting on a complaint from the fraud control unit of Bajaj Finance Group, have recently busted two fake call centres run in the name of Bajaj Finance and arrested two persons from Mumbai and three from Delhi.

The fraud control unit received complaints from people that they were approached by the customer care executives of the finance company who would offer loan at 4% interest and take payments in the name of processing fee and GST and later switch off their phone numbers.

“We got information about two suspicious call centres operational at Haware Infotech Park and Vashi Plaza. Along with the fraud control unit of the company, we raided the call centres and verified their documents and found that they were fake,” assistant police inspector Sachin Dhage from Vashi police station said.

Later, the police arrested two managers — Imtiaz alias Sohail Maulana Qureshi (29) and Shabana Sohail Charniya (25) — who ran the call centres.

Senior police inspector Ramesh Chavan from Vashi police station said, “Following their arrest, we traced the main three accused to Delhi after looking at the trail of money transfers. Two more accused are wanted in the case.”

Till now, the police have received 75 complaints of people who were cheated of around ₹15 lakh in total.

The modus operandi of the accused was to take a commercial space on rent for the call centre and then hire girls for speaking to the ‘customer’ by putting up an advertisement in OLX and quicker. The girls would be told that they were employees of Bajaj Finance and given the training.

They would target people from rural areas who were mostly farmers and labourers and were in need of loan, Mr. Dhage said. “They have targeted people from Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Pune Rural, Buldhana, Aurangabad and Satara. The loan was offered between ₹1 lakh and ₹25 lakh and then the person would be asked to send their Aadhaar and PAN details on WhatsApp. The caller would then send their ‘employee ID card’ on WhatsApp to win the customer’s confidence. After procuring some money in the name of processing fee, bank charges, and GST, the callers would switch off their phones and then change their numbers before targeting new customers,” he said.

He added that the victims included a farmer who had taken a loan for his son’s MBA and another farmer who had wanted to purchase a tractor and got a loan of ₹4 lakh. Till now, the police have found seven bank accounts used by the accused. The managers worked on a 10% commission and the rest of the money was transferred to the main accused in Delhi.

The accused arrested from Delhi have been identified as Kallan Jaan Mohammad Mallik (53), Faizan Kallan Mallik (24) and Mohamaddar Junaid Asgar Usmani (20).

In Vashi, the gang had been operating for the last two months and before that they had similar call centres at Koparkhairane and Sion. It is suspected that the accused have been cheating people over the past two years.

All the five accused are in police custody till April 23.","Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray on Wednesday asked the civic administration to start vaccination centres in all 227 electoral wards in the city. He was inaugurating a vaccination centre at Ackworth Leprosy Hospital in Wadala.

Given that all those above 18 will be eligible for the vaccine from May 1, centres should be started in 227 corporators’ wards, said Thackeray.

The BMC plans to double government vaccine centres to 100 and allow large corporate houses to vaccinate their staffers and go for “aggressive vaccination” to cover an estimated 80 lakh adult population. The BMC will need 1.6 crore doses for this exercise.

BMC plans to have at least four government vaccination centres in each of the 24 administrative wards in addition to the private centres.

The newly inaugurated centre at Ackworth will have two booths and capacity to vaccinate 400 citizens daily. With the addition of the new centre, there are 130 vaccination centres across the city. Of these, 39 are in civic-run hospitals, 17 in state-run hospitals and 73 in private hospitals.

However, due to non-availability of vaccines, some private hospitals had temporarily suspended the vaccination drive since Sunday. On Tuesday, 38 private hospitals, 6 civic-run and 5 state-run hospitals did not administer vaccines.

Until Tuesday, BMC had vaccinated 2.76 lakh people with both doses and 17.66 lakh people with the first dose.","At least 24 patients died at the government-run Dr Zakir Husain hospital in Maharashtra’s Nashik district after oxygen supply was affected due to a leakage in the main storage tank.

Enumerating the reasons, the MoHFW affidavit stated that in case of Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI), there might be a delay in reaching the health facility and managing that case may not be as per requirement. Moreover, it said that it might be challenging to ensure that the beneficiary is under observation for at least 30 minutes after vaccination.

The ministry said that another reason was high vaccine wastage due to increased time going from door to door, taking more time for reaching out to reach the beneficiary.

Responding to the court’s query as to whether there is a mandatory requirement of ICU for administration of vaccine, the MoHFW stated, “The occurrence of serious/severe AEFI is very rare, which may not necessarily require admission into ICU. Hence, there is no such requirement for an ICU for administration of vaccines.”



The HC is likely to hear the PIL this week.","The prosecution's case is that Indrani Mukerjea, along with her former husbands Sanjeev Khanna and Peter Mukerjea, had killed Sheena Bora, who was born of her previous relationship, in the year 2012. (File photo)

Sheena Bora murder case accused Indrani Mukerjea and 39 other inmates of the Byculla prison here have tested positive for coronavirus and shifted to a quarantine centre, an official said on Wednesday.

These 40 inmates were found positive for coronavirus after they were subjected to Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), he said.

“Most of the 40 inmates are asymptomatic. They were shifted to the isolation centre of the prison at Patankar School in Byculla in Central Mumbai as a precautionary measure,” he said.

The RAT was performed on Sunday as one of the women prisoners was found infected and shifted to the Covid care centre at St George Hospital in South Mumbai, the official said.

Subsequently, RAT was conducted on 350 women prisoners, 225 men inmates and 60 staff of the jail, out of whom 40 women tested positive for coronavirus.

Mukerjea has been lodged at the Byculla prison since her arrest in the murder case in August 2015.

The prosecution’s case is that Mukerjea, along with her former husbands Sanjeev Khanna and Peter Mukerjea, had killed Sheena Bora, who was born of her previous relationship, in the year 2012.","Even as the surge in Covid-19 cases continues in the industrial city of Pimpri-Chinchwad —2,613 cases were registered on Tuesday — it has emerged that so far youngsters in the age group of 22 to 39 years have been most affected.

The data shows that among those who tested positive for Covid-19 in the last one year, a whopping 43.33 per cent are young people in the age group of 22 to 39 years.

According to PCMC health and medical chief Dr Anil Roy, till April 20, Pimpri-Chinchwad has registered 1,86,025 Covid positive cases. “The first corona case was detected on March 10, 2020. But it was after lockdown was lifted in third week of May, 2020, that positive cases started spiralling. They reached their peak in August and September. And then from October and November, the cases started falling. It was only from the third week of February, 2021 that cases started rising again and registered the highest figure of 34,000-plus in March, 2021,” he said.

Of the 1,86,025 positive cases registered so far in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Dr Roy said 43.33 per cent or 74,971 were positive cases in the young age group of 22 to 39 years. “This is because many of them are youngsters who keep moving from one place to another, attending parties and gatherings. They socialise a lot. Then there are those working in offices and industrial units. They regularly move out of their homes and have to interact with each,” he said.

Besides the youngsters, the middle-age group (40 to 59 years) is the second-most affected by coronavirus. “In this group, 29.99 per cent or 51,539 were affected by coronavirus,” said Dr Roy.

The third most affected group falls in the 60 to 69 age group category. In this age group, 7.69 per cent people have been affected. And only 5.04 per cent of those above 70 years of age have been affected by Covid. “People in this age group do not travel or move outside their homes. They catch the virus if someone in their home is affected…These people also suffer from co-morbidities and get easily affected by the virus,” a senior medical officer said.

In the youngest age group of 13 to 21 years, 6.91 per cent have been affected by Covid. “The young mingle freely. Though they get affected by coronavirus, the symptoms are not severe in these age group,” Dr Roy said.

The health department officials said out of the total cases, 60 per cent are male and 40 women. “Obviously, more men move out of their homes than women. Women more often go out of their homes for grocery or vegetable purchases. More men travel in connection with their work and also visit hospitals to check on their friends and relatives,” said a senior official.

Dr Roy said the vulnerable groups are those above the age of 60 and those who have co-morbidities. “Citizens should continue to take extra care of these family members. If they are not tested and treated quickly, the patients deteriorate in no time. Therefore, they need treatment without even a day’s delay,” he said.

Dr Rajendra Wable, dean of YCM Hospital, said, “In cases of senior citizens and patients with comorbidities, the number of deaths is high because of the delayed treatment. Many of the patients from vulnerable groups have been brought to YCM Hospital when their saturation level has dropped to dangerous levels. Families continue to delay treatment for seniors and patients with comorbidities. If they take treatment in quick time, there is no reason why lives cannot be saved. If people find it difficult to afford treatment at private hospitals, they should go to civic hospitals. At least, families should get the patient examined and tested first.”

By Tuesday, Pimpri-Chinchwad had over 23,000 active cases. Out of these, 15,000 people are in home isolation.

Maval MP Shrirang Barne, in a letter to civic and Maval taluka officials, wrote, “The number of those in home isolation in civic limits as well in Maval taluka are increasing. The civic and district officials should keep close check and monitor the patients strictly. They should ensure that these patients do not roam outside their homes. At the same time, their health should be monitored closely. If they need hospitalisation, the officials should ensure the same without wasting any time.”","The case relates to Kaushal Zha, an undertrial lodged in Kalyan jail, booked on charges of assault after a complaint was filed by a jailor.

A SESSIONS court in a recent order acquitted a 25-year old undertrial, booked on charges of assault and abuse of jail staffers, in Kalyan jail. The court held that the investigating officer had only recorded the statements of police witnesses after a delay of eight days, casting doubt over whether the assault took place.

“When accused was talking to inmates passing by there were other independent witnesses who could have corroborated the case of prosecution. However, the Investigating Officer has conveniently listed and examined police witnesses though independent witnesses are available,” the court said.

The case relates to Kaushal Zha, an undertrial lodged in Kalyan jail, booked on charges of assault after a complaint was filed by a jailor. The complaint said Zha had come to the gate of the circle he was lodged in and abused officials and made comments to other inmates passing by.

While Zha said he was at the gate seeking to be produced before the court via video-conference, the officials said he had held the collar and caused injuries to one of the staffers. Zha claimed that he was falsely implicated as the jail officials apprehended that he would complain against them before the court.

Zha also said he himself was admitted to the jail hospital after the incident but the medical record of that day was not submitted before the court.

The court agreed with this contention and said this shows that “prosecution is trying to put curtain on wrong deeds committed by them”.

“This fact (non-submission of medical papers of the day of the incident) leads to infer that accused was admitted in the jail hospital and was given treatment. In such circumstances, the defence of the accused seems probable,” the court said.

It added that there were discrepancies in the statements of the jail staff and the seizure of the clothes and the medical evidence showed that the injuries as mentioned in the complaint were not sustained by the jail staff.

The court also said the investigating officer had not seized the register maintained in the jail where a record of inmates’ misconduct is made. It also referred to the delay in recording of the statements.

“…the investigating officer should have recorded the statement of the witnesses at the earliest. The reason given by the Investigating Officer that the witnesses were on duty is no ground as he could have sought permission from their superior to record their evidence. Instead of doing so he has recorded the statement of the witnesses after eight days of the incident. There is unjustified undue delay on the part of Investigating Officer in recording the statement of the witnesses which casts doubt on the case of the prosecution,” the court said.","Sassoon hospital has recorded 2,885 Covid deaths and, according to authorities, 523 were brought dead to the tertiary care hospital.

THE STATE-RUN Sassoon General Hospital will step up its bed strength for Covid-19 patients to 700 in another week’s time. A total of 66 doctors will also be recruited on an urgent basis, Director of Medical Education and Research Dr T P Lahane told The Indian Express.

To date, 27,797 suspected Covid-19 patients have been admitted to the hospital since March last year, of which 7,805 tested positive for the novel coronavirus and have been treated. Sassoon hospital has recorded 2,885 Covid deaths and, according to authorities, 523 were brought dead to the tertiary care hospital. On April 19, out 42 deaths recorded at the hospital, 14 were brought dead.

With 525 beds occupied in the super specialty building, Sassoon hospital authorities said an additional 175 beds will be made ready in two different buildings on the premises. Considering the increasing number of Covid patients, Dr Lahane said that they had agreed to recruit 66 doctors on an urgent basis. “Nine doctors have already been appointed,” Dr Lahane said.

S Chockalingam, Settlement Commissioner and Administrator of Sassoon General Hospital, told The Indian Express that they had a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Dr Lahane, Sassoon hospital Dean Dr Murlidhar Tambe and others over the need to step up bed strength and also to discuss demands made by resident doctors who had gone on strike.

Dr Tambe said they had already issued an advertisement and have decided to recruit doctors with MBBS degrees. According to Sassoon authorities, there are 120 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, while non-Covid work has not stopped. Doctors at the hospital said daily OPDs were also functional and, to reduce the load, medicines were prescribed for over a fortnight.

Dr Vijay Yadav, president of the Pune unit of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors, said they had resumed work after a day’s strike.

Pune ZP waives restrictions, allows doctors from other states to work

To deal with staff crisis in Pune rural areas and ensure that there are adequate number of healthcare personnel across 172 hospitals and Covid care centres, authorities at Pune Zilla Parishad have waived restrictions and allowed doctors from across states to work in rural parts of Pune. “Most doctors are registered with their medical councils and apply for work positions in their own respective states. At the application stage, however, we have waived this restriction. An advertisement was issued and, in the last 10 days, 58 MBBS doctors have been recruited. There is a need for 100 doctors and 30 MD (medicine) physicians. We have received more than 106 applications from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Karnataka, Puducherry and others,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO of Pune ZP.

In a unique initiative, 16,000 employees have contributed one day’s salary and raised a corpus fund of Rs 1.97 crore. Of this, the base salary for an MD physician of Rs 75,000 and Rs 60,000 for an MBBS doctor will be given from National Health Mission while a contributory amount will be from Pune ZP’s corpus fund.

Prasad has appealed to doctors preparing for competitive exams and requested them to join and serve in rural parts of Pune.","Employees pack boxes containing vials of AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine at the Serum Institute of India, Pune. (AP Photo)

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea by Cutis Biotech seeking to restrain Serum Institute from using the ‘Covishield’ trademark.

The HC said the ‘Covishield’ vaccine is widely known and a temporary injunction will cause confusion and disruption in the vaccine administration programme.

A division bench of Justices Nitin M Jamdar and Justice C V Bhadang was hearing an appeal by Nanded-based Cutis Biotech.

Advocate Abhinav Chandrachud for Cutis submitted that his client on April 29, 2020 had filed an application for registration of trademark ‘Covishield’ for veterinary, Ayurvedic, allopathic, medicinal and pharmaceutical preparation and vitamins and dietary food supplements for humans and animals and the application is pending registration in the Trademark office. Whereas Serum Institute applied for registration of trademark ‘Covishield’ for its Covid-19 vaccine.

Chandrachud submitted that in May last year, as Cutis Biotech received products like antiseptic and disinfectant liquid bearing brand ‘Covishield’ from its manufacturers and the same were sold in various states, the trademark ‘Covishield’ has become a distinct product and the business of Cutis Biotech, which is a “prior user”, and the same cannot be used by Serum Institute. He said that the suppliers of Cutis Biotech have stopped providing goods, causing damage to its business.

However, senior advocate Birendra Saraf for Serum Institute submitted that his client had coined the trademark ‘Covishield’ in March 2020 and inter-office communication had begun on the same and sought dismissal of appeal.

In December 2020, Cutis Biotech had filed a trademark suit against Serum Institute in the Commercial Court in Pune seeking to restrain Serum and to maintain accounts regarding sale.

On January 4, 2021, Cutis Biotech filed an application before a District Court (Commercial Court) in Pune for a temporary injunction on Serum Institute and restraining it from using the trademark Covishield.

The district court noted that the products of both companies were used for different purposes and their visual appearances were different. Considering the implication of grant of injunction, the court had noted the pandemic situation and importance of vaccines and therefore rejected the interim application on January 30. Cutis Biotech then approached the HC.

After hearing submissions, the bench noted that neither Cutis Biotech nor Serum Institute have registration for the trademark. It observed, “Not only is there adequate evidence to show prior adoption and user, but Serum Institute has also continued its user without a break. Serum Institute has produced 60 million doses of the ‘Covishield’ vaccine per month and has supplied 48 million doses to the Government of India… the District Court was correct in holding that there will be no deception or likelihood of confusion in the products of Cutis Biotech and that of Serum Institute.”

Dismissing the appeal by Cutis, the HC held, “With these facts, the balance of convenience is not in favour of Cutis Biotech. Grant of injunction against Serum Institute would have a serious impact on its business.”","""Essential category shops will be open for public only from 7 am to 11 am,"" said Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar.

DISSATISFIED WITH the impact of existing restrictions on containing the Covid-19 surge, the civic bodies of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad on Tuesday decided to tighten restrictions by directing essential shops to remain open only for four hours from 7 am to 11 am. Stores can, however, deliver items to homes till 6 pm.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday directed the state administration to increase movement restrictions. The existing restrictions allowed essential shops to be open for customers throughout on weekdays, but it has been noted that people were moving out in large numbers on the excuse of visiting these stores.

“Essential category shops will be open for public only from 7 am to 11 am,” said Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar.

Essential shops include groceries, vegetables, fruits, dairy, bakery, sweet and other food items, including meat, chicken, poultry and fish. The four-hour decision will also be applicable to agriculture-related stores, pet shops and others in the essential category.

Kumar said they will be allowed to do home delivery from 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. The civic administration has declared complete lockdown on weekends till May 1. Those violating restrictions will face action under the Disaster Management Act.

The civic bodies urged people to observe Ram Navami on April 21, Mahavir Jayanti on April 25 and Hanuman Jayanti on April 27 at home in a simple manner. “There should not be any function organised on the festival day at temples. There should not be any religious, cultural or social function on the occasion,” Kumar said in a separate order.

Trustees or management of hospitals can live telecast temple prayers online or with the help of cable network. There should not be any procession held on the occasion, he added.","17:29 (IST) Apr 21

""As per today's demand we have sufficient Remdisiver, the only challenge is that of distribution. So I would appeal to doctors to use oxygen and Remdisiver properly,"" he said. ""We're anticipating that 15 per cent of currently active cases may need oxygen. As of now, we have arrangements of 1550 MT of oxygen in the state.

MUMBAI: At least 24 Covid-19 patients on ventilator support suffocated to death on Wednesday when their oxygen supply stopped suddenly because of a malfunction in the main storage at a civic-run hospital in Nashik in Maharashtra, officials said.The government will probe if the tragedy at the Dr Zakir Husain Hospital was due to negligence, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.A private company looked after the tank maintenance at the hospital, District Collector Suraj Mandhare said, adding technicians closed the tank valve preventing more deaths.Three days before the tragedy, the Union health ministry's Covid-19 data compiled between March 16 and April 15 from major cities showed Nashik the worst-hit city in the country in terms of cases per million residents.Wednesday's disruption of medical oxygen supply was caused by leakage from a storage plant, officials said.Of the 150 patients admitted to the hospital, 23 were on ventilator support at the time of the incident while the rest were on oxygen support, a senior civic official said.The municipal corporation shifted cylinders from other facilities in the city to help the patients at the hospital after the leak, which was noticed around 12.30 pm, an official said. Hospital officials then contacted municipal commissioner Kailash Jadhav seeking technical help to stop the leakage.A 13 kilolitre oxygen tank was set up on the premises of the hospital, located in the Dwarka area of Nashik.""Around 10 am, a socket of the oxygen storage tank broke and the leakage started. When the hospital staff came to know about it, they deployed jumbo cylinders to supply oxygen to the patients and started shifting some of the patients,"" an official said.The leakage has been stopped, the tank repaired and the oxygen supply is being normalised, he said.Soon after the incident, people rushed to the hospital hindering rescue operations.""An oxygen tanker had reached the hospital premises when the leak happened. Technicians who came with that tanker and technicians at the hospital broke open the lock of the tank and closed the valve which prevented the further leakage of oxygen,"" he said.Tope said the 24 patients died due to a low supply of oxygen caused by the leakage from the storage tank.All of them were on ventilator support, the minister said. The family of each deceased will be given financial assistance of Rs five lakh each from the CM relief fund.""The liquid oxygen which was filled in the tank has the temperature of around (minus) 180-degree celsius. There is extreme pressure on the walls of the tank which supplies oxygen to patients on ventilator support,"" Tope said.Jadhav said no patient is in a serious condition now.The oxygen level was around 25 per cent in the storage tank at the time of the incident, he said.Two oxygen tanks were set up at the hospital recently and the maintenance work was given to a private company.An official said the incident occurred when oxygen was being filled in one of the tanks from a tanker, which disturbed the supply to the patients who were on ventilators as well as to those dependent on oxygen for breathing.Leela Shelar, who lost her 60-year-old mother in the tragedy was inconsolable. ""My mother was admitted on Tuesday and put on ventilator support,"" she said.Shelar said as her mother complained of difficulty in breathing, she had requested the nursing staff to help, but they didn't pay heed.""I didn't admit my mother here to die like this,"" she said while fighting back her tears.Union home minister Amit Shah and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari expressed anguish over the tragedy.Police dispersing a crowd of onlookers and the entry at the hospital was restricted after the incident.Nashik police commissioner Deepak Pandey said people's emotions are intense, adding arrangements for adequate police deployment have been made. The area has been sealed, he added.A video of oxygen purportedly leaking from the storage plant went viral on social media in the morning.Relatives of the deceased reached the hospital soon after hearing of the incident and are demanding that stringent action be taken against those responsible for the tragedy.","Nagpur: Former state cabinet minister Anees Ahmed has requested mayor Dayashankar Tiwari to set up a Covid care centre at Haj House. Ahmed met Tiwari on Tuesday and said that during the time of crisis, itâs important that every possible infrastructure be put to use for benefit of people.Ahmed said, âI have also sent a request to minister Nawab Malik (minorities department) to ensure that elevators and other amenities at Haj House are made functional.âThe former minister also sent a similar request to district collector and divisional commissioner.âDuring my tenure as minority affairs minister, I managed to get one acre land sanctioned to build the Haj House on 20,000 square feet. It was a result of a long struggle and nearly Rs16 crore was spent on construction. So in this pandemic time, no better utilization of Haj House could take place than setting up a Covid care centre,â said Ahmed.He added that apart from treating patients with mild symptoms, the centre can also provide a stopgap arrangement for patients needing oxygen till they got a hospital bed.","NAGPUR: At least two hospitals in city hit the panic button late on Tuesday evening and asked relatives to take the patients away as Covid treatment could not be continued due to shortage of oxygen supply. Late assurances by the collector to replenish stock has prompted these hospitals to retain the patients as of now.In a related setback, the Centre has reduced Maharashtra âs allotment from the Prax Air Sail Bhilai plant by almost 55%. In an order dated April 18, the stateâs share has gone down from 110 metric tonnes (MT) to 60 metric tonnes from the plant. Nagpur used to get around 25 MT from Bhilai. Now, this quantity is likely to reduce.With the district already facing a shortage of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab drugs to tackle the north-bound Covid graph, district collector Ravindra Thakare dashed a letter to the state oxygen movement coordinator to take up the case with the Centre and restore the quota. Not just the treatment of current patients, lack of oxygen will also set back districtâs plan to increase the number of beds.The district already faces an acute shortage of oxygen. While the requirement is 166.5 MT, Nagpur gets only 136 MT.Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association , said the shortage of oxygen has reached alarming levels. âWithout oxygen, we are clueless how to continue treatment of patients who are currently admitted,â he said.Dr Prashant Jagtap, of the Viveka multispecialty hospital, said the management was planning to discharge about 100 patients (60 on Covid beds and 40 on non-Covid). âOxygen was short in supply but the issue was resolved with the intervention of the collector and NMC,â he said.Another hospital in Dhantoli too called relatives to take away the patients. A relative who did not want to be identified by name said the 60 Covid patients managed to get beds allotted four days ago after a lot of struggle. âThe staff wanted us to either take away the patients or get the oxygen cylinder refilled,â he said.The man added that family members of the patients took cylinders and began making rounds of the city for oxygen. âNo one was ready to give a refill,â he said.A doctor from the hospital said 62 patients were on oxygen beds. âWe had a stock of only 40 jumbo cylinders since morning. We requested the collector and many agencies for additional stock but to no avail. After our request, relatives of three patients took them other hospitals. Now, the collector has assured of supply. Treatment will continue only if we get it,â he said.","NAGPUR: Ventilator has become much sought after apparatus in the pandemic. Needy patients are given life-saving artificial respiration through a ventilator. But, this system is very expensive and not suitable for use in rural and remote areas. Recognizing this problem, an engineer from Yavatmal has developed a versatile low-cost ventilator. It is also accredited by Government of Indiaâs nodal agencies.Akash Gaddamwar from Yavatmal and his friend Eshan Dhar from Jammu and Kashmir were working on this design even before the pandemic struck.âAfter completing our engineering from IISc Bangalore, we formed a start-up Gyrodrive Machineries Ltd. We launched several innovations and won Rs 2 crore funding prize from Government of India,â said Akash. Their start-up was approached by Dr Rajeev Chauhan, assistant professor in the anaesthesiology department in the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, with the concept. They accepted the challenge and developed a handy ventilator The concept is simple. AMBU bag is the most common handheld tool used to deliver positive pressure ventilation to any person with insufficient or ineffective breathing. Itâs common sight in medical colleges and rural hospitals across the country to see attendants or patientsâ relatives operating the manual AMBU bags to save life.The device provides mechanical support with battery back-up to this system. The device is operated by a small motor that automatically pressurizes the AMBU bag at the required rate. It ensures controlled pressure and exact amount of O2 to the patient. The device has been patented and Akashâs start up has all approvals from necessary nodal agencies.The prototypes are in use at PGIMER Chandigarh. Now, the duo is seeking investments to start mass production of the device.âIt is handy, weighs just 6 kgs and can be transported even on a bicycle. As Covid-19 cases are now growing in rural areas, it will prove a big boon for our country,â said Akash.âI have seen patients often relying on the manually operated AMBU bags in rural hospitals. These provide only short-term solution. Our machine has 6, 12 and 24 hours back-up options. The battery keeps charging itself if we plug the device in common household socket,â said Akash.According to him, the machine, can be fixed in small ambulances being used to carry Covid-19 patients. It can be attached with O2 cylinder or simply can get oxygen from air and provide it to the patient.Respiratory Control Device* Low-cost solution for effective ventilator support* Allows easy setting of parameters like respiration rate and tidal volume* Inbuilt lung parameter monitoring system ensures patient safety* Battery supported; 6, 12 and 24 hour back-up prototypes ready* Weighs just 6 kgs, can be transported on two-wheelers, even bicycles* Cost effective too, mass production will reduce cost* Also approved by governmentâs nodal agencies* Can be fixed in makeshift ambulances, carried to remote places","NAGPUR: In March, the city witnessed 1,307 more deaths than usual, after accounting for Covid-19 victims and the average monthly fatalities before the pandemic. This hidden toll, which is three times the registered Covid fatalities, is also a result of the pandemic, say doctors and activists. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has compiled data of cremations performed in March at 23 ghats, 10 Muslim cemeteries and two Christian cemeteries in the city. This shows 3,351 funerals were performed in the city in March.The district started to witness second wave of the pandemic from third week of February. Cases and deaths rose from beginning of March. The district registered 763 Covid-19 deaths in March, of which 446 were residents of the city, 224 from rural parts of the district, and 93 from other districts who succumbed during treatment in hospitals in the city.Funeral of all deceased from city was done here. As per norms, 93 deceased from other districts were also cremated here. Around 40% (90) of 224 deceased from rural parts of the district were also cremated here. Thus, 183 deceased from rural and other districts were cremated here. So, of the total 3,351 funerals, 3,168 funerals done in city were of native residents.In March last year, there had been 1,415 funerals in the city, which can be considered the routine number of deaths. Adding the cityâs official Covid toll of 446 in March, we would expect total 1,861 fatalities. However, since there were 3,168 funerals, the city witnessed 1,307 excess deaths in March.If one considers data of last 12 months of the pandemic, the city registered 3,286 excess deaths, which is almost at par with the official Covid toll of 3,248.Convener of Vidarbha Hospitals Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar told TOI, âThe statistics are alarming. This can surely be linked to the pandemic as there was no other obvious cause for fatalities. Many patients are testing negative in RT-PCR but positive in CT scan and other clinical parameters in second wave. Deaths of swab negative patients were obviously not counted in Covid toll.âHe also said the health infrastructure is unable to handle the load, and many seniors with comorbidities did not get hospital beds, and their home deaths may have been certified without RT-PCR test. Anyway, RT-PCR test of dead body has become practically impossible as home visits from laboratories have stopped due to high case load. Also, relatives do not wish to wait for RT-PCR results in 24-36 hours before going for the funeral. âThe city does not have enough mortuaries even if people waited for RT-PCR reports of all such deaths,â he said.Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, âThere is high possibility of Covid deaths due to lack of access to medical care or delayed care. With almost all hospitals turned into Covid, getting bed for non-Covid patients has become difficult. Also, many patients are not willing to go to hospital due to Covid scare. If healthcare system has collapsed, all deaths should be counted as Covid fatalities in direct or indirect manner.âActivist Narayan Ahuja said, âMany senior citizens and comorbid died at homes with symptoms, but without tests being done in March. The number is higher in April, which will become clear after NMCâs data is here next month. NMC should investigate all home deaths to find exact impact of the pandemic. These deaths are due to improper management of disaster and lack of awareness by authorities.â","NAGPUR: For the first time in Maharashtra âs history, entire Std X board exam ( SSC ) has been cancelled due to the rising cases of Covid-19. School education minister Varsha Gaikwad told TOI the decision has been taken as âhealth of students is the priorityâ. For Std XII (HSC), the government has continued with its status as âpostponedâ but no new dates have been announced.

Gaikwad said, âThere was unanimity in taking the decision about SSC cancellation . In the next few days, the state board will study how to allot marks to students. We will inform the public soon about the criteria and evaluation parameters.â

Former chairman of Nagpur divisional board Ravikant Deshpande welcomed the decision. âI was at helm in 2020 when the virus struck. We finished our entire HSC schedule before things got worse and only one SSC paper (Geography) was cancelled. It was indeed a mammoth task to get the papers evaluated and collate marks data and declare results. I am happy the government took a student-friendly decision,â said Deshpande.

Madhu Joseph, principal of Bengali High School, said this decision could have been made sooner. âI am relieved at this decision by the education minister. With the number of cases increasing everyday, itâs a wise decision. Health is wealth and Maharashtra government has taken the right step,â said Joseph.

Mrunalini Dasture, principal of The South Public School, said, âI am extremely happy because students and parents were very worried. The virus strain we have is not sparing children either, so going ahead with the examinations would have spelt disaster.â

Ashnarayan Tiwari, principal of Adarsh Vidya Mandir (Gandhibagh), said, âWe were confident government will take this decision, sooner or later. Lot of parents were in touch with us and kept on asking whether or not the exams will be cancelled.â

Shrikrishna Ramteke, principal of Bharat Vidyalaya, said the cancellation prevented mass infections. âLakhs of students would have appeared for these exams and you can imagine the repercussions of that,â said Ramteke.

On April 12, education minister Gaikwad had announced postponement of both SSC and HSC exams. Gaikwad also mentioned that she will contact other boards and ask them to reconsider their exam schedule since their schools were located in Maharashtra, where the Covid-19 cases are rising steadily.

Two days later CBSE announced cancellation of Std X exams and postponement of XII. Within a few hours of this, Gaikwad announced state board is also looking into cancellation of SSC, which was finally announced on Tuesday.

NAGPUR: In temporary respite to Bollywood actor Vijay Raaz , the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday stayed proceedings of an alleged sexual harassment case against him at Gondia sessions court.

âBy an interim order, it is directed that the proceedings of regular criminal case pending before the second joint civil judge of junior division and judicial magistrate first class (JMFC) in Gondia shall stand stayed till further orders,â a division bench comprising justices Zaka Haq and Amit Borkar said.

The 51-year-old actor, who had been working with the film fraternity for over two decades and has acted in more than 100 movies, had knocked the HCâs doors through counsel Saveena Bedi, praying for quashing the police complaint lodged against him at Gondiaâs Ram Nagar police station by the complainant on November 3 last year.

Subsequently, the petitioner was booked under Section 354-A and 354-D of IPC by the police. He was, however, released on bail by Gondia JMFC the same day. The police then filed a charge sheet on December 12 in JMFCâs court.

According to the complainant, who was working with the accused as an assistant director on a set of film âSherniâ at Gondia, he had called her to his room under the pretext of some work, but only passed time. On October 27, he tried to keep his hand over the shoulder, and then repeated his acts and also passed remarks.

Raaz contended the survivor had filed the case to malign his reputation and to gain popularity and it was nothing but a figment of her imagination. The contents of the charge sheet clearly show contents for FIR are not made out.

According to him sexual harassment would be met only if there is physical contact and advancements involving unwelcoming and explicit sexual overtures. âAlso, if there is a demand for sexual favours or showing pornography against the womenâs will or making sexually coloured remark that would amount to the harassment,â he contended.

","SATAK (NAGPUR): âThankfully there has been no death in the village since last two,â says the over 70-year old Bapurao Wadibhasme. Itâs horrible, exclaim locals when asked about the situation due to Covid Around 40 kms from the city, Satak â a village on the way towards Ramtek has seen 18 deaths in 18 days this month. On paper, itâs only four due to Covid, yet the spate of deaths has left locals shocked. In a little more than a fortnight ago, the village has lost close to 1% of its population to sudden deaths.Those at the Panchayat say some were old. âItâs not our village alone, there have been deaths like these in nearby places too,â said a Panchayat official.The governmentâs primary health centre (PHC) that caters to 19 villages with a total population of 17,000 is located at Satak.

Earlier, there would be one odd death in three to six months. She said there is a great reluctance towards vaccination. âWe have made door to door appeals but there is a general scare. They say vaccine will give them fever,â she said.âWE also need to have oxygen cylinders in the village to give immediate aid in case of need. At present there are 60 active cases of Covid in the village,â said a Panchayat source.Vicky Wadhibashme, a relative of Nilesh, who died of Covid, said they had a tough time getting a hospital. âWe first took him to Bhandara but it was too costly there. Nilesh was then taken to a private hospital in Nagpur where he died,â he said.Dr Vaishali Hinge at the PHC said things were very much under control after an aggressive vaccination drive has been undertaken. So far 2,600 out of the target population of over 15,000 have been vaccinated.

NAGPUR: Hospital beds equipped with a made-in-India gadget â Dozee â are proving helpful for many hospitals in Vidarbha in the time of health manpower crisis. Recently, guardian minister Nitin Raut also directed hospitals to increase the use of such technology-enabled beds to deal with the staff crunch.

With this Contactless Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) device, doctors can remotely monitor and treat patients. Currently, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital ( IGGMCH ) in Nagpur has 150 beds equipped with the Dozee instrument, Government Medical College and Hospital ( GMCH ) has 100, while Kingsway Hospital has 25. Hospitals in Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Bhandara are also using this system.

Dr Vaishali Shelgaonkar, associate professor and HOD of department of anaesthesia at IGGMCH, said the equipment has been installed in Covid wards since September 2020. âSo far, 2009 patients have been monitored by this equipment. Of these, 73 patients have been admitted to the intensive care unit after being found to have gone to high risk. This has helped save lives of 48 patients. Also, 162 patients have been treated with timely oxygen and ventilators due to changes in their condition,â she said.

âDue to shortage of trained nursing staff, it becomes difficult to keep active watch on the health of all patients continuously, especially outside the ICU. We have adopted Dozee RPM to help us manage patients who require continuous monitoring while safeguarding our staff,â she added.

With second wave of Covid-19 hitting record highs every day, hospitals in Nagpur and especially intensive care unit (ICU) beds are under tremendous pressure. Remote Patient Monitoring can be an effective solution in this phase of the pandemic, said Mudit Dandwate, co-founder of Dozee, who hails from Vidarbha.

âHospitals across the country are now adopting new AI technologies. We are closely working with hospitals in Nagpur since last one year and have very good experience to protect healthcare workers and patients,â he said. Dandwate added, in the last two weeks, more than 30 hospitals have signed up with Dozee across India and currently over 4,000 Covid-19 High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds are being monitored continuously.

Now, Dozee has now set up a Patient Monitoring Cell for Nagpur hospitals to ensure 24x7 on-ground support and alert escalation. According to Dandwate, this will help doctors with the required data on each patientâs vitals at the right time and will enable them to take required action.

HOW THE DEVICE WORKS

A sensor sheet is placed under the mattress and connected to SPO2 and portable devices

Devices are connected to internet

While sensors monitor the parameters, readings are available on mobile phone app

In case a patientâs vital parameter deteriorates, alarm goes to the nurse

Earlier, ICU-like monitoring in HDU was only possible with few beds

","NAGPUR: Finally, the Divisional Railway Hospital in the DRM office campus, Jaistambh square, has been declared a dedicated Covid Care Centre (CCC) with initially 50 oxygen beds. Within a day, all the beds have been occupied. There are 100 oxygen beds at the hospital.After the high court rap on Monday, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is also exploring the possibility of utilizing 11 railway coaches (176 beds) available as isolation facility for patients in Nagpur. A joint inspection of the facility was conducted on Tuesday.TOI on April 13 & 16, had reported the Central Railway and civic administration were in talks to declare 100-bed railway hospital as a Covid hospital. The administration has also opened a separate entry point from Mohan Nagar side for Covid-19 patients.On April 15, the railway hospital had closed its general OPD, all specialty clinics, and operation theatre to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection from the hospital.The hospital is now confined to emergency facilities such as Covid-19 and flu clinic, casualty, emergency, and train calls. Periodic medical examination (PME) will also be conducted for limited number of employees as per the schedule by maintaining Covid-19 protocol. The general OPD has been shifted to Ajni railway clinic.Divisional commercial manager (DCM) and Central Railway spokesperson Vipul Suskar said, âThe facility is for the railway employees as well patients from outside.âA team of additional municipal commissioner, senior divisional mechanical engineer (SrDME), railway doctors, station director, and other officials inspected the coach facility to quarantine Covid patients.Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, âOur visit was planned after high court order asking to explore the modified railway coaches. in the 11 coaches, 176 patients can be accommodated. We will submit a report to the court tomorrow.âSources who were part of the inspection said, âNMC officials had some reservations about placing oxygen. Otherwise, the coach facility can prove good with a dedicated entrance from the Cotton Market side. Train movement can be changed from other platforms. In Nandurbar station, 21 coaches are being used for isolating patients.âMeanwhile, a day after Maharashtra issued a fresh Covid protocol for passengers arriving from Kerala, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Goa, & Rajasthan, it was business as usual with no passenger being detained for want of RT-PCR negative test as directed by the state government.âWe are thermal scanning the passengers but other things like setting up rapid antigen test (RAT) facility and screening of passengers has to be done by the NMC, which is the disaster management authority (DMA), which was not done on Tuesday,â said railway sources.","NAGPUR: The district continues to witness high number of Covid-19 deaths , with 91 patients passing away on Tuesday. In another step to tackle this, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has proposed to develop yet another Covid hospital with 100 beds at Mulak Ayurvedic College, Nandanvan.The fatalities declined by 22 in the district on Tuesday compared to the highest-ever single day toll of 113 on Monday.

NAGPUR: A four-year-old tigress from Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary , 180km from Nagpur, has been detected with a wire snare. An operation has been launched to rescue the animal.

The tigress T2-C1 is from the second litter of parkâs dominant female T2. It was noticed having a snare on its leg in Mathni area by patrolling staff on April 18. âThere is an injury in the left front leg. The snare, suspected to be of either steel wire or a nylon rope, is still tied to its leg,â said Subhash Puranik, division forest officer (DFO), Pandharkawda.

âA search has been launched with the help of a wildlife veterinarian, a WII researcher and other field staff. Yesterday, the tigress was in our vicinity but escaped. We will soon rescue the animal,â Puranik told TOI.

On March 21, 2021, a 5-year-old tigress had died after getting its neck entangled in a wire snare in Ghonsa in Maregaon range under Pandharkawda. The 148sqkm Tipeshwar sanctuary has a history of people laying snares to kill animals but no lessons have been learnt, activists said.

They called for regular de-snaring drives in the fringe areas. These snares are mostly laid by villagers to poach deer, wild boar, and chitals for meat. Tigers get caught in them with tragic consequences. There are 14 villages bordering the sanctuary.

This is the fourth recorded case in Tipeshwar of a tiger getting entangled in wire snare. On November 22, 2011, a three-year-old tiger had died after getting entangled in a snare near Bodh Bahattar village.

A full-grown tigress (T4) was found with a wire snare in the neck on September 11, 2017. T4 moved around with the snare for 18 months and died in the sanctuary on March 18, 2019, during an attempt to capture it by forest staff. Another tiger T1-C3 was found injured with a snare around its legs in the core area of Pilkhan on May 29, 2019. It was rescued by WII experts.

DFO Puranik said, âWe have decided to suspend grants to eco-development committees (EDCs) in villages involved in such illegal acts. I have already issued notices to some EDCs. We have benefitted these villages with several government schemes and the distribution of LPG. Yet, villagers laying snares and also indulging in starting forest fires is unacceptable.â

","NAGPUR: Concerned over deaths due to Covid-19 and unavailability of beds, oxygen and medicines, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court reminded the Maharashtra government about its obligation to save them.âAt this juncture, we must point out that it is the stateâs solemn duty to save and preserve precious life of every citizen under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. We would be failing in our duty if we do not remind the government of this solemn obligation by doing whatever is possible for it today in this direction,â a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said.While hearing a suo motu PIL based on TOI reports of bed shortage, the bench pointed out the spike in Covid-19 cases witnessed in Nagpur is of the steepest kind, not seen even during the first phase of pandemic last year. âWe all agree that urgent steps are required to be taken. In this direction, some of the suggestions have been given by amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar, senior counsel MG Bhangde, government pleader Ketki Desai and counsel for the respective parties.âWarning the medical and paramedical personnel, and also institutions and organizations, to join duties to contain Covid-19 pandemic after being requisitioned by the government, the bench warned them of action. âAll of them are duty bound to obey the directives passed by the nodal authorities with immediate effect. We would like to warn them that if any names of the defiers are supplied, this court would not hesitate to take necessary action, including contempt of lawful authority and also issuing punitive orders.âThe warning came after the collector and NMC commissioner informed that even though specific orders have been issued by them as nodal authorities under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act, requisitioning services and facilities for the purpose, the orders are not being strictly complied with by some medical and paramedicals personnel, institutions and organizations. This is affecting the quality of healthcare being provided by medical fraternity under their supervision.âWe must remind such reluctant or disobedient service providers and duty renderers that if they do not comply with the orders, they would be failing in their constitutional obligation and doing so at their peril, inviting coercive action against them. However, considering the present situation and ordinary human difficulties, HC would be the last one to resort to any coercive measure against any reluctant or disrespectful personnel, institutions and organizations,â the judges said, adding that they wouldnât be punishing them at this juncture.Reminding the doctors working or posted in government hospitals about their duties, the judges said everyone is duty bound to meet the obligation and give medical assistance for preservation of life.âNo law or state action can intervene to avoid or delay the discharge of paramount obligation cast upon the medical profession members. The obligation to preserve life being total, absolute and paramount, laws of procedure whether in statute and or otherwise, which would interfere with its discharge, canât be sustained and must, therefore, give way to whatever is conducive to saving and preservation of precious human life,â they said.Collector, NMC to verify condition of 4 hospsThe HC directed collector and NMC chief to verify conditions of ESIC and three Ayurveda hospitals on whether they could be converted to treat Covid-19 patients. The total capacity of all these four establishments is 450. The suggestion in this regard came from IMA counsel Bhanudas Kulkarni.âOn being satisfied that these hospitals can be made functional, those should be started for treating coronavirus patients by Wednesday evening and a report shall be placed before this court,â the bench said.","NAGPUR: Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday slammed the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) for discrimination in Remdesivir distribution, particularly for Nagpur division.Speaking to the media during his visit to the vaccination centres in his Southwest constituency, the former chief minister hailed the Nagpur bench of Bombay high courtâs orders to the Maharashtra government to immediately send 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injection to Nagpur district by Tuesday 8pm.âThere was a big discrimination in the distribution of this essential drug. Some powerful ministers were drawing excess stocks for their constituencies in cities like in Mumbai. The government must ensure fair and equitable distribution to all. Ideally, they should distribute the medicines where the number of patients is more. It wasnât happening and therefore, the court needed to interfere.âHe quoted examples that on few days, the district received very less Remdesivir stocks and one day, not a single one, despite the fact that thousands of critical patients needed it.Deliberating on the ongoing lockdown imposed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray government till April 30, Fadnavis said the coronavirus continued to wreak havoc despite all measures taken by the administration and therefore, the government needed to think on revising the strategy and implement new measures.24x7 toll free helpline opened for Covid patientsSouthwest MLA Devendra Fadnavis opened a helpline â 08929908958 â and support centre for the coronavirus patients on Wednesday. It was set up in a joint venture with RSS promoted Sevankur NGO comprising many doctors and medical students, who will render their service free of cost.âThe Covid patients are more in panic nowadays. They will get medical advice from the experts and also the psychological help if needed. They will also get assistance for bed arrangements and medicine availability. A cardiac ambulance service would start from Thursday for the needy patients. Offices of me and Union minister Nitin Gadkari would also coordinate with the helpline office-bearers,â he said.","NAGPUR: A day after the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ordered the state government to send 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur district to tackle the Covid crisis, the district administration received only 1,100 from different sources on Tuesday compelling it to postpone its distribution to hospitals treating coronavirus patients.With around 165 Covid hospitals and some facilities, having more than 7,000 beds, waiting for the crucial anti-viral injection, the stock received by the district administration was only 15% of the total demand.On Sunday too the district administration could not distribute the injection due to short supply. On April 17, only 395 vials were received.As no Covid patients could be administered Remdesivir, the death rate on Monday was a pandemic-high of 113. With yet another âzeroâ supply on Tuesday, the city hospital administration is expecting the worst on Wednesday. Not just Remdesivir, even other Covid-saving drugs like Tocilizumab and Alzumab are in short supply.âFrom now, whatever little Remdesivir stock is received will be distributed. There is a possibility of 5,000 reaching the district on Wednesday,â said district collector Ravindra Thakare who discussed the crisis with top officials of revenue department and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday evening.âOn Monday, we could meet only 60% of the demand and the stock received was far too less for distribution on Tuesday,â added Thakre.According to a highly-placed source, even the details of the 1,100 Remdesivir vials did not reach the collectorâs office till late making the job difficult of allotting it to the hospitals.Around 20 vials of Tocilizumab are expected to arrive by April 23. Even oxygen shortage has severely hit the district and region.According to Dr Anup Marar , convenor of the Vidarbha Hospitals Association , the district faced a panic situation and making relatives and patients anxious. âThere is surplus stock in western Maharashtra hospitals but Vidarbha patients continue to get step-motherly treatment in terms of allotment,â he said.","NAGPUR: Former home minister and NCP MLA from Katol Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday took stock of the Covid spread in his constituency and also appealed to citizens to cooperate with the administration which is engaged in fighting against the pandemic.Deshmukh, who was accompanied by district collector Ravindra Thakare and officials from the revenue and police department, also reviewed the law and order situation in the taluka.

He added that an unidentified person had earlier handed over the rod to Shetye at the time of the incident.

Police registered the FIR on Tuesday under sections 429 and 34 of the IPC , along with section 11(1)(a) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act , 1960.

""Assistant commissioner of police of the anti-corruption bureau ( ACB ) Sudhir Kudalkar actively helped in the lodging of the police complaint against the accused person, who was also called to the police station for further inquiry. It is shocking how an educated citizen can act so violently against a mute, innocent animal. The dog is currently having pain in his jaw for which further treatment is going on,"" said activist Rahul Koshaley, also a member of Pal Adoption and Rescue Group.

Koshaley further stated: ""We have urged the authorities to ensure the safety of the victim dog, as we fear that the animal may be harmed in future. People like Shetye are a menace to society and must be punished with the strictest of punishment.""

The FIR was lodged by an animal lover, Shahrukh Sayyed, who was visiting a relative at the Andheri based housing society. As soon as he got to know about the animal cruelty, he first acquired the CCTV footage from the society and later contacted the activists in order to lodge the FIR.

","MUMBAI: Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the state will request the Centre to increase the oxygen quota from other states allotted to them from 300 metric tonnes (MT) to 500 MT.At present 1,250 metric tonnes of oxygen is being produced in the state and about 300 metric tonnes of oxygen are being supplied from three other states, he said.He also said that there are six plants in the state which can produce oxygen, but it cannot be transported as there is no bottling plant and so it has been considered to set up 500-bed Covid hospitals in each of the company's premises.""We may soon have 3,000 additional beds with oxygen supply. Preliminary work has begun,"" said Tope.Two of these plants are in Raigad district, close to Mumbai.He said that a total of 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen is being used in the state at present.It is being distributed under the control of the Food and Drug Administration and the concerned district collector, said Tope.Tope said that the state government has empowered district collectors to give orders for setting up of oxygen generation plants and even to purchase oxygen concentrators for their district.Each district has to purchase a minimum of 200 oxygen concentrators each.","LIVE NOW

MUMBAI: A 40-year-old tuberculosis patient from Vasai attempted suicide in the office of the Palghar district collector in Maharashtra by drinking a floor cleaning liquid on Tuesday.

He was admitted to the government hospital and is out of danger.

The man alleged that he and his wife worked in an Andheri based hospital.

They lost their jobs after being detected with TB four years ago.

His wife passed away months after being detected with TB and their son, now aged six, has been sent to an orphanage in Kalyan.

He said that while he did odd jobs, that too dried up during the lockdown.

He was unable to pay the house rent.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has heaped praises on Mayur Shelke , a pointsman in Mumbai Division of Central Railway for saving the life of a six-year-old by risking his own life.

Shelke, whose job is to check railway signals, noticed that the boy had slipped onto the railway tracks from the platform at Vangani railway station.

As the boy's visually impaired mother cried for help, an alert Shelke, raced towards the boy, bundled him onto the platform, and swiftly clambered onto it himself. Within seconds, the Udyan Express had crossed Vangani station.

CM Thackeray, while praising Shelke on phone, said that he saw the thrilling video which went viral days after the incident.

The CM added that he did a great job which cannot be expressed in words and advised him to take care.

Thackeray further said, âYou (Shelke) got a lot of blessings from a mother for saving the life of her child by risking your own life which is beyond imagination and really appreciable,â said Thackeray.

","MUMBAI (MAHARASHTRA): Three people were arrested from Mira Road in Thane district of Maharshtra for allegedly black marketing Remdesivir on Wednesday.The police also recovered three vials of Remdesivir and stock worth Rs 2.25 lakh from their possession.""The arrested accused were selling a vial of a Remdesivir at a price of Rs 12,500,"" said Tulinj police officer Rajendra Kamble.Kamble further said that the Tulinj police had laid a trap on the orders of Mira Bhayandar Vasai Virar Police, sent a fake customer for the purchase of Remedesvir injections and caught them.Earlier on Monday, Mumbai Police and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) teams raided two locations and recovered 2,200 vials of Remdesivir.The demand for Remdesivir has increased in India and the hospitals have been grappling with depleting supply of the anti-viral drug amid surging Covid-19 cases.India, currently witnessing a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, reported nearly 3 lakh fresh infections in the last 24 hours - the highest since the pandemic broke out last year.","Representative image

MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday shunted out Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Abhimanyu Kale after over half a dozen cabinet members demanded action against him for his ""inept"" handling of the controversy over remdesivir supply and distribution in the state, saying he failed to act despite specific information on stocks. Kale was appointed commissioner on October 20. Special commissioner (sales tax) Parimal Singh will succeed him.

â FDA knew of Bruck stock, bowed to netasâ pressureâ

Housing minister Jeetendra Awhad was the first to demand action against Kale, who was followed by urban development minister Eknath Shinde and skill development minister Nawab Malik. Sensing the mood of the cabinet members, Thackeray stepped in and declared that Kale would be transferred immediately.

âAwhad had briefed him on the movement of remdesivir in Maharashtra . He had even given him the addresses where it might be stored, but he did not act,ââ a cabinet member said.

The minister said that another issue that was raised was that Kale did not take note of the large hoardings put up by a former legislator declaring his plan to distribute remdesivir to the public in the region comprising Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Dhule. The minister said that even after Malik had made sensitive disclosures, the FDA officials failed to act.

The cabinet member said that another complaint was that in the city, the FDA did not wake up even when the police seized large stocks of remdesivir.

âOur information is that the FDA had full information on the stocks with Bruck Pharma, but it failed to take cognisance owing to mounting political pressure,â he said.

Kale did ask the Nandurbar collector to conduct a high-level inquiry into the âillegal distributionâ of remdesivir on Monday, but by Tuesday the NCP and the Congress were asking why former BJP legislator Shirish Choudhary and officials of Bruck Pharma had still not been arrested in the matter.

","No option but to impose strict lockdown: Minister

MUMBAI: A 51-year-old senior medical officer from Sewri TB hospital died of Covid-19 late on Monday, around 36 hours after posting her parting words on Facebook.Dr Manisha Jadhav, fondly remembered for her efficient juggling of clinical and administrative roles, became the first doctor from the civic health setup to die of the infection. According to the Indian Medical Association , nearly 18,000 doctors have contracted Covid and 168 have died in the state since last March, but few have been adequately compensated.On Sunday, Jadhav wrote a Facebook post from her ICU bed saying this could be her last greeting. ""May be last Good Morning. I may not meet you here on this platform. Take care all. Body dies. Soul doesn't. Soul is immortal,"" she wrote.However, home delivery from these shops have been allowed from 7am to 8pm, and local bodies have been given the authority to change home delivery timings. These restrictions came into force from 8pm on Tuesday and will be in force till 7pm on May 1. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no option but to impose a strict lockdown. Officials said guidelines for a lockdown are being drafted, and restrictions on timings for essential shops will continue. Attendance in government offices may be reduced, and a ban on inter-district travel is expected.Officials said there were also suggestions regarding the shutting of public transport for the general public from some ministers, but that may not be feasible as many people step out for medical emergencies and even for vaccinations and rely on the use of public transport. A final call on this will be taken by Thackeray. Urban development minister Eknath Shinde said, âA demand for a complete and strict lockdown like last yearâs was raised in the cabinet meeting, and the CM has agreed to it. Cases are going up rapidly and health infrastructure is proving inadequate. If strict steps are not taken, people will die on the streets without getting treatment.â He said with so many cases, Maharashtra was falling short of oxygen and was getting 300 MT from other states. âEven those states will stop giving us as cases are going up there as well,â Shinde added.Housing minister Jintendra Awhad said, âMinisters pressured the CM to announce a lockdown. There is a Covid-19 death in every other house in the state, and if the situation doesnât improve, Maharashtra will collapse.âThe data on the Covid spread in the state which was presented to the state cabinet reflected concerns raised by the ministers. The average weekly growth rate of cases in the state is 1.7%, but there are nearly 20 districts in the state that have a higher growth rate. Also, time taken for cases to double has dropped from 56 days as on March 31 to 40.5 days as on April 19. Tope said, âImposing a strict lockdown is a must for the state. We will also be ramping up the supply of oxygen, increasing bed capacity and boosting supply for the anti-viral Remdesivir injections.â He said another decision taken in the state cabinet was that district collectors have been allowed to give orders to set up oxygen generators without having to wait for the tendering process. âSome cities like Thane and Kolhapur have already given orders to set up oxygen plants in their premises, and those can be taken into consideration in other districts as well,â he added.","MUMBAI: School education department minister Varsha Gaikwad said that the criterion on the basis of which results will be declared for SSC students and the date of result declaration will soon be announced. On Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education decided to cancel SSC exams .âThe school education department is committed to devising a fair and accurate assessment criterion,â Gaikwad said. She also said that the department would explore the possibility of giving students the option of appearing for the exam at a later date.Public health minister Rajesh Tope said, âAll ministers opined that students should be promoted as no school could open during the last academic year except for online education.âParents across the state have welcomed the move. Anubha Sahai, member of the India Wide Parentsâ Association, said, âIt is a great decision by the state government. It will not only save students from anxiety, but also keep them safe in these difficult times. The boards and students can begin planning for the next academic year.â There had been a growing demand from parents groups across the country for board exams to be cancelled.Teachers are, however, apprehensive. âEven if the board has cancelled SSC exams, the guidelines for scoring students are very important. They must consult stakeholders and make the decision at the earliest,â said Anil Bornare, a teacher at Swami Muktananda School, Chembur. Most boards have not yet announced their guidelines. Another teacher raised concerns over first-year junior college (FYJC) admissions. âUnlike many parts of the country, the competition for FYJC seats is fierce in Maharashtra, especially Mumbai. So while the move to cancel SSC exams is in the interest of students, the government must plan ahead keeping in mind the admission process. All students will be marked at their respective schools and there might be no parity when they compete for college admissions,â said Shivnath Darade, a teacher.","MUMBAI: After the detection of 11,200 Covid cases on April 4, the daily caseload in Mumbai has been steadily dipping, and, on Tuesday, 7,192 cases were registered.The cityâs Covid graph has clearly begun showing a âplateauâ or a dip that is apparent from the weekly growth of cases: as against 67,795 cases detected between April 5 and 11, 58,988 cases were found between April 12 and 18 (testing numbers in both the weeks were around 45,000 on most days except Sundays).However, the second Covid wave in Maharashtra hasnât been running parallel to that in its capital city: in fact, the fall in cases in Mumbai has been accompanied by a rise across Maharashtra. As against 3.9 lakh cases registered between April 5 and 11 across Maharashtra, 4.3 lakh cases were found the subsequent week. âMumbai appears to have peaked, but cases are increasing in multiple districts,â said a senior health department doctor.While none of the districts have the number of cases that say, Mumbai, Pune or Nagpur see on a daily basis, there is a sharp rise in terms of percentages. For instance, districts such as Solapur, Kolhapur and Chandrapur are witnessing a surge. âCases in Gadchiroli have more than tripled in a week, but it has a smaller caseload than most cities,â he added.In Sangli, for instance, the weekly graph in April shows an increase from 279 to 806. , which was a spot of concern during the first wave as well, has increased from 1,752 to 2,582 in the same period. In other words, there is no new hotspot to replace Mumbai, but a simultaneous rise across many districts.Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state governmentâs task force on Covid-19, said the second wave started in clusters across the state. âThe cluster spread faster in cities and spread over to rural areas. While Mumbai seems to have passed the peak or is on the peak, so are Pune and Nanded, but the rest of Maharashtra is still showing a growth,â he said.A senior state official said the surge in smaller cities and towns may be smaller compared to bigger cities, but it is equally concerning as the infrastructure cannot cope. âWe are also seeing a surge in deaths from smaller cities as patients are reporting late,â said an official.In Yavatmal, where daily detections are up from 243 to 931 in a week, most cases are coming from rural areas of the district. Officials said the number of tests has been kept constant for the last 3 weeks, still cases are increasing rapidly. Rural spread is one of the major reasons, said civil surgeon Dr Tarangtushar Ware. âCases are coming from across the district, but cases from rural areas are more in the last one week,â she said.","MUMBAI: Seeking to put to rest the fears of Mumbaikars as the city sees a high number of Covid cases every day, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said that since the second wave began , the case fatality rate (CFR) in the city has been 0.3%. This, he said, was much lower than Delhiâs CFR of 1.41%.Civic data shows 947 Covid deaths were reported in the city in the 68 days between February 11 and April 19, while the total number of patients in this period has been 2,66,105.âThe city reported around 7,000 cases on Tuesday, showing that there has been a decline in the last five days. Also, 87% of cases reported on Tuesday are asymptomatic. Our doctors, availability of all medicines and our healthcare mechanism are the reasons the fatality rate has been low,â Chahal said.In many first-wave hotspots in the city too, the fatality rate has been lower, officials said. For instance, in Worli Koliwada, which is again seeing a surge in cases, there have been only two deaths reported since March, they said. Similarly, Dharavi, which reported over 200 deaths between April and July last year, had only five deaths in February and four in March. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward which covers Dharavi, said asymptomatic cases are being traced sooner this time because of increased testing. âTherefore, we have been able to trace positive patients before they turn serious or have any complications,â he added. In Dharavi, Dighavkar said that they are tracing more random cases than through contact tracing.Another senior BMC official said private medical practitioners now have set protocol to treat their patients. âThis ensures that patients are treated before their condition deteriorates. Besides, BMC and other government hospitals now know much more on how to handle the crisis than last year. Of course, the large number of positive cases daily is placing a burden on them,â the official said.Parel-based general physician Dr Jeevan Jain said he has so far virtually treated almost 15,000 patients. âThe first wave taught us a lot, and although the second wave is much more dangerous and infectious, we are able to treat patients virtually. We start treatment by sending them a detailed message on what they must follow and what medication is advised. They are also asked to send videos of their oxygen levels and body temperature. Owing to early treatment, I have hardly had to ask any of my patients to get admitted to hospital,â he said.","Representative image

MUMBAI: A 250-bed Covid care centre for Covid positive police personnel was restarted at Kolekalyan in Santacruz East on Tuesday.

The centre, which was started last year, treated several personnel but was subsequently closed when cases reduced. A control room to handle admission has also been set up at Kolekalyan. Mumbai Police have lost 102 personnel so far.","A pharma company representative in the garb of Spiderman santizes a chawl at Sion Koliwada on Tuesday

MUMBAI: Householders, retailers and traders are anxious over the state governmentâs decision to restrict timings of shops from 7 am to 11 am . They pointed out that crowds may, in fact, increase during these hours, unlike previously, when footfalls were dispersed through the day. Police may find it difficult to manage the numbers.

Citizens fear they will have to wait in queues at stores for milk, groceries and vegetables. âMy wife and I both have recovered from Covid-19. Is it feasible to spend the morning hours lining up for essentials each day? At least earlier, we headed out in the afternoon when no crowds were present. And what if some infected person breaks home quarantine to join the queue?â asked a retired government servant from the western suburbs .

Although home delivery has been permitted till 8 pm, shopkeepers said they will stop catering to small value orders. âWith three delivery boys, we only sent orders worth upwards of Rs 150-200. Now the exodus of labour has caused a shortage of manpower, making home delivery difficult and not cost-effective. Two of my five workers have gone to the village, leaving just three to handle supplies, cash counter and delivery,â said a grocer from Andheri.

Retailersâ federation president Viren Shah questioned the wisdom of having to summon staff for four hours a day. Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of Retailers Association of India said, âRestricting timing may lead to crowding, which is a health risk. It may result in operational challenges, supply chain issues, panic buying and hoarding of essentials. Citizens also need clothing, hardware, electrical, household and kitchen items.â

The daily evolving norms make room for corruption too. âIt will take much to convince me that we can curb Covid by grouping people together during concentrated hours. Night curfew also made little sense. It only helped police make a quick buck,â said Shailesh Pawar, a vendor in Khar.

","Maharashtra will collapse if situation doesnât improve, says minister

MUMBAI: Maharashtra is likely to face a strict lockdown for 15 days as Covid-19 cases in the state have continue to surge despite strict restrictions for a week. A demand for a complete lockdown was made by most ministers in the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to make an official announcement by addressing the state on Wednesday.The state government on Tuesday also added fresh curbs (reported by TOI in Tuesdayâs edition), restricting the timings of grocery and other food shops to only four hours from 7am to 11am.

It has been projected that Mumbai will have over 1.4 lakh active cases till May 2 if the cases continue to increase at the current rate, which is nearly twice the active cases today. Also, Mumbai will have a shortfall of over 6,000 oxygen beds, 1500 ICU beds and 121 ventilator beds. Cities like Nagpur and Pune have also been projected to have a massive shortage of beds.Tope said, âImposing a strict lockdown is a must for the state.

Next is H-West ward (Bandra, Khar and Santacruz), with a rate of 1.84%.Officials say that currently most new cases are from contact tracing while index cases are few.

""We are following all micro-containment zone guidelines and have explained the same to the residents of sealed buildings. The ratio of index cases to other positive cases is 1:3. A person is infecting family members and at times also household help and drivers. We have increased testing,"" he said.Malabar Hill activist Indrani Malkani said the problem is that people are still not following Covid-appropriate behaviour despite being into the second year of the pandemic. ""People will be seen wearing face masks that are falling off their nose or using a hand sanitizer only for the sake of it and not to ensure that they are protecting themselves from infectious germs. The problem is also asymptomatic people infecting others,"" she said.On a positive note, in H-West, where till recently over 500 cases were being reported, since April 15 the numbers are down to 350-400 a day."





"Amid rising Covid-19 cases and shortage of medicinal oxygen in several states, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij has accused the Delhi government of stealing oxygen from a tanker that was on its way to Faridabad hospitals on Tuesday. To avoid any more such alleged incidents, Vij has issued instructions that all oxygen tankers will now be escorted by state police force.

In a series of tweets, Vij alleged that a tanker carrying oxygen for supply to Faridabad’s hospitals was allegedly stopped in Delhi and the gas taken out of it.

In his tweets and a video message released Wednesday, Vij said, “I came to know that the tanker was stopped by certain people in Delhi yesterday, while it was on its way to Faridabad for distributing oxygen to certain hospitals. If the governments forcibly start stealing oxygen like this, it will lead to chaos. It is highly condemnable”.

About the supply and availability of oxygen in Haryana, Vij added that “supply of oxygen in Haryana is surplus. Against a production of 270 MT of oxygen in Haryana’s plants, our consumption as on date is 60 MT. We are under pressure to supply oxygen to Delhi, but we shall first secure our own state’s requirement and then send the surplus Oxygen to other States. Himachal was sending oxygen from its plants in Baddi to Haryana, which they have stopped. Similarly, we were also getting oxygen from Rajasthan that too has now been stopped. Thus, whatever oxygen we are generating in Haryana, we shall secure it for our patients first of all and then supply it out of the state”.

In its first state-level monitoring committee’s meeting, Monday, Vij had ordered the officials of Food and Drugs Administration to deploy their personnel at all the oxygen manufacturing plants across Haryana to monitor generation of oxygen from these plants. The sState police personnel were also deployed at all these plants to check pilferage and black marketing.

At the same meeting, Vij had also instructed officials of the industries department to get in touch with all the plants to explore modalities of increasing their capacity to generate more oxygen.","CALLING THE situation “alarming”, Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said on Tuesday said the state has just a day’s vaccine stock left, at a time when the central government has also announced that everyone above 18 years of age will be eligible for inoculation from May 1.

The minister, who got his second dose of the vaccine at Mohali on Tuesday, said that with highest vaccine coverage, Pathankot is continuously leading in Punjab in the Covid vaccination drive.

Sidhu said Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had raised the issue of shortage of vaccines in Punjab during the virtual meeting with the Government of India (GoI) and demanded immediate supplies of and quick approval for two new oxygen plants in the state amid concerns over depleting stocks of both.

He said Punjab has the capacity to vaccinate at least 3 lakh persons a day through more than 3,000 government health centres but due to lesser supply of vaccine from GoI, it was not able to achieve the target of vaccination of 2 lakh persons per day.

So far, about 23.4 lakh persons have been administered the vaccine in Punjab under which 1,69,268 healthcare workers with the first dose, 81,104 health care workers with the second dose, 3,14,427 frontline warriors with the first dose and 72,845 with the second dose, have been vaccinated. Similarly, 18,63,111 beneficiaries from 45+ category with the first dose and 90,172 with the second dose, have been vaccinated.

For strengthening treatment and management services, the state government has identified 16 more private hospitals which meet the standards of tertiary care facilities, he said adding at present, there are sufficient numbers of L2, L3 and ventilators beds in Punjab.","CHANDIGARH: Haryana minister Anil Vij on Wednesday alleged that a tanker carrying medical oxygen for Covid patients in hospitals, which was going from Panipat to Faridabad, was ""looted"" by the Delhi government and said all oxygen tankers will now move with a police escort.Vij also said given the increased demand for oxygen due to a surge in coronavirus cases, Haryana can spare the supply for others only after the state meets its own demand.Interacting with reporters, the health and home minister, while referring to the tanker, said, ""Yesterday, one of our oxygen tankers was going from Panipat to supply to hospitals in Faridabad. When it was passing through Delhi, the tanker was looted by the Delhi government which is very wrong.""""If governments indulge in such things, then it will result in chaos,"" he said.Vij said that he has now ordered that all oxygen tankers will move with a police escort so that such incidents do not happen in the future.""But to take out gas from a tanker in this manner is highly condemnable,"" he said.""We will write to Delhi government officials about this incident,"" he said.He further claimed that pressure was being put on the state to give medical oxygen to Delhi. Faridabad in Haryana lies adjoining the national capital.The minister said the two neighbouring states from which Haryana earlier used to get the supply for oxygen have currently stopped it to meet their own demand.""We also used to get supply the from Baddi in Himachal Pradesh and Bhiwadi in Rajasthan but the governments there have stopped the supply now,"" he said.""In our plants in Haryana, I have deployed officials and police because we want to first meet our requirements. Pressure is being put on us that we should supply to Delhi.

The Rajasthan State Human Rights Commission (RSHRC) has taken cognisance of the death of two Covid-19 patients at a government hospital in Kota district, with the family members alleging that the deaths took place due to disruption in oxygen supply.

Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma, a member of the state human rights panel, has sought a factual report from the state government on the matter. The hospital administration has denied that the deaths resulted from oxygen shortage.

“My brother-in-law Asif Hussain (26) was admitted to the New Medical College Hospital (NMCH) about 17-18 days ago. Later he tested positive for Covid-19 and was subsequently put on ventilator support. Late on Monday night, his condition deteriorated after the oxygen supply stopped. We could overhear the hospital staff saying that the oxygen plant had stopped working,” said Farid Mohammed, who was with Asif at the hospital.

He alleged that the oxygen shortage continued for 45 minutes, resulting in the death of Hussain and another patient, a woman.

“The oxygen supply had stopped entirely and it was not a case of low oxygen pressure. All the patients who were on ventilator support were experiencing breathing difficulties. After 45 minutes, oxygen supply was restored but Hussain died around 5:30 am on Tuesday,” Mohammed said.

Family members said that Hussain, who was a resident of Morak in Kota district, got married just three months ago and used to run an e-Mitra kiosk.

In its order on Wednesday, the RSHRC sought a factual report from the state government about the incident by May 5 and also directed the chief secretary, principal secretary, health department and the DGP to ensure that such incidents are not repeated. It also asked the state government to issue guidelines in this regard.

“Stoppage in oxygen supply can result from some technical reasons or carelessness. The responsibility lies with the person under whose jurisdiction the oxygen plant came,” said the order by Justice Sharma.

He added that ‘humanity has been shamed’ because of the incident.

While denying that the deaths of the two patients resulted from oxygen shortage, the NMCH hospital administration conceded that the oxygen pressure had decreased after a delay in filling the cylinders.

“Our demand for oxygen is very high and some difference in supply had been observed. A certain pressure is needed to run a ventilator. At present, the consumption is so much that all the oxygen cylinders are opened at a time. When a cylinder gets empty, a new cylinder has to be installed. But if there’s any delay on the part of the vendor who has to fill the cylinder, there’s nothing we could do. That day, the vendor’s vehicle arrived two minutes late, resulting in a drop in oxygen pressure for 2-4 minutes,” Nilesh Jain, superintendent, NMCH Kota, said.

However, he claimed that the two patients, who were in critical condition, didn’t die because of oxygen shortage or decrease in its pressure. But Hussain’s brother-in-law insisted that there was negligence from the hospital’s end and oxygen shortage was responsible for his death."

"Apart from 521 bed strength at the Government hospital here for admitting patients testing positive for COVID-19 virus, the district administration has established two more new facilities with 100 beds each, said District Collector P Madhusudan Reddy here on Wednesday.

Speaking to reporters after a review meeting with the officials and doctors from the Health Department, he said that as a precautionary measure, 100 beds each have been kept ready at Pannai Engineering College campus in Sivaganga and at SMH Hospital, Tirupathur. Already, there were 72 beds in Amaravathipudur TB Hospital, he added.

The Collector said that within about three hours of screening (taking swabs), the results were sent by SMS to the patients who tested positive. With the coordination of block level officers, health inspectors and village health nurses, the patients were moved to the hospital and treated.

There was no need for panic, Mr. Madhusudan Reddy said and appealed to the people to remain indoors all the time. This would help the official machinery to fight the virus at a faster pace. The government, he said, had imposed night curfew and stressed the people to cooperate

He said that fever clinics that have opened up across the district had to a great extent helped in early identification of fever, cough and other ailments. The Health department had conducted 27,219 fever clinics and 11.77 lakh people were screened.

The Collector said that people above 45 years were advised to get the vaccine dose at designated vaccine centres including GH and Primary Health Centres. So far, 45,943 persons had been inoculated. The vaccine shortage was being addressed and there would not be any issues, he hoped.

The district, according to the media bulletin released by the Department of Health, had 7821 persons with COVID-19 as on date. So far, 7,270 had been discharged and 422 people were identified as ‘active cases’.","Residents of Ramanathapuram village in S. Paraipatti panchayat in the district have appealed to the Municipal administration to immediately install drinking water tap connections in each of the dwelling as there was every possibility that there may be a surge in COVID-19 cases.

The residents, especially womenfolk, have to trek long distances to fetch potable water. Though in the past (for about two years), they had requested independent water pipelines, the authorities had not done so till date, they charged.

People flout social distancing norms and line up up before the taps to fetch water in plastic pots and containers. Apart from long queues in open grounds and below overhead tanks, where taps have been fitted, the residents also queue up on the highways here.

There was every possibility of communicable disease spreading as the womenfolk stood in the slush to fill water.

An official at the S Paraipatti panchayat said that drinking water tap connections were being provided to the dwellings under the Central government programme. The District Rural Development Agency had drawn up a comprehensive plan and laying of pipes was being done as per schedule. Due to the pandemic and the recently held elections, the works had been stalled, he added.","The All India Youth Federation (AIYF) staged a protest on Wednesday demanding a probe into the alleged swapping of bodies of two persons by staff at the Government Medical College and Hospital, Theni.

The members of the federation called for a thorough inquiry into the shocking incident and said that appropriate action must be taken against those responsible for the negligent act. They must not go unpunished, they said.

A 71-year-old man, Ayyavoo of Batlagundu had fainted near a bus stop and he was referred to the Theni Government Medical College Hospital for treatment. However, he died at the hospital.

The body was kept in the mortuary for the conduct of a post-mortem as it was a medico-legal case. Under these circumstances the body of one Ramu of Periyakulam was also lying in the mortuary.

The mortuary staff allegedly handed over Ayyavoo’s body to the relatives of Ramu. The body was then cremated by them. The incident came to light after the relatives of Ayyavoo came to the hospital to collect the body for cremation.","Two liver transplants performed on critically ill patients during pandemic

The Velammal Medical College Hospital and Research Institute in Madurai has successfully performed 113 transplants, including kidney and liver, over the last three years, according to its chairman M.V. Muthuramalingam.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, he said recognition from the State government in the form of ‘best transplant centre' award consecutively for three years came as a motivation to the team of surgeons, physicians and medicos at the hospital.

Stressing the need for organ donation, he said during the COVID-19 pandemic, the hospital performed two liver transplants on two critically ill patients — a 13-month-old boy from a village near Rameswaram and a 46-year-old man suffering from jaundice.

Transplant surgeon Senthil said the diagnosis for the baby boy, weighing just 10 kg, indicated that he had jaundice when he was six months old. He was the recipient of a liver from a four-year-old brain dead patient from JIPMER, Puducherry. After the successsful transplant, the child was recovering.

Similarly, in the case of the 46-year-old man, live liver transplant became possible after a family member came forward to be a donor. The patient showed signs of recovery at the hospital.

Besides the coordination of doctors and surgeons from multi-departments, the infrastructural facilities at the hospital also played a key role in executing such complex transplants. Earlier, patients would be referred to Chennai or other cities for transplants. Now, it was no longer required for patients to travel long distances, Dr. Senthil added.

Alwar Ramanujam, Head, Department of Solid Organ Transplant, said liver disease was seeing a rise. Though there were many causal factors, alcohol consumption and obesity were key areas to be looked into. The State government’s Chief Minister Medical Health Insurance Scheme, which was available at Velammal hospital, had come as a boon to economically weaker sections, especially, in transplant surgeries.

Suggesting a few tips, he said physical exercise for about 30 minutes daily and intake of vegetables and fruits would keep people, especially those above 45 years, in good shape. With four lakh patients dying every year due to non-availability of organs at the right time, it would be ideal to be fit and healthy.

He appealed to the media to campaign for more organ donations as it was rebirth to needy patients.","In the wake of a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, the election officials are contemplating a few changes at the counting centres.

Increasing the number of halls or reducing the number of tables, increasing the gap between counting tables and avoiding over-crowd are among the measures being considered by the District Election Officers and the Returning Officers. They were among the points discussed during the video conferencing by Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo with the Collectors cum District Election Officers on Monday.

The focus of the meeting was centred around the ways and means to check the spread of the COVID-19 infection. While the DEOs explained the arrangements being made in the counting centres, they presented detailed reports about the size of the halls and the gap to be provided between the officials and agents of the candidates.

As per the standard practice, 14 tables will be provided with a distance of one to two metres in a hall. Each table will be manned by a counting supervisor, an assistant and a micro-observer. There will be provision to accommodate an agent for all candidates. The agents would be standing in a close quarter. The meeting discussed the ways and means to increase or decrease the counting halls in accordance with the COVID-19 safety protocol.

“There were some suggestions made to follow the safety norms to check the spread of the COVID-19 virus. No decision has been taken so far. But there will be some changes in the counting centres. They will be done in accordance with the Election Commission’s directives,” Prashanth M. Wadnere, Collector cum District Election Officer, Karur, said.

As far as the counting centres in Karur were concerned, the halls were compact and there was no need to increase them. However, officials are of the view that there will be literally no space if all 77 candidates in Karur constituency and 44 candidates in Aravakurichi constituency depute each one to 14 tables.

“We have requested the Independent candidates of Karur and Aravakurichi candidates to limit their agents in view of the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Some of them have agreed not to appoint agents except for their presence. We hope that better sense will prevail,” said a senior officer in Karur.

In Tiruchi, Collector cum District Election Officer S. Divyadharshini held an all-party meeting here on Tuesday to solicit the views of political parties on enforcing COVID-19 norms.

“If we need to enforce safety norms, it is inevitable to reduce the number of tables to restrict the number of officials and agents. It will lead to an increase in the number of rounds,” an official, who took part in the meeting said. He said that an idea had been mooted to make compulsory for the officials and the agents to get themselves tested for COVID-19.","In the wake of the spread of COVID-19 virus, The Tamil Nadu High-Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association has urged the government not to insist the teachers to come to school regularly.

In a press statement, the members of the Association said that some teachers had to travel from remote places to reach the schools.

Also, some of the teachers who had returned from poll duty had tested positive. The summer vacation should be advanced and the teachers should be allowed to take online classes from their residences, said M. Murugesan of the Teachers Association.

The bridge courses were announced by the government for students of Classes I to IX.

The members said that they were apprehensive of travelling to schools when COVID-19 cases were on the rise. The teachers could assist the students from home, they said.","The ‘sudden’ decision by the Kerala authorities insisting on COVID-19 certificate and e-pass for entry into the State resulted in thousands of cardamom workers resorting to a road roko near the by-pass stretch here on Wednesday.

Following the flash strike by workers, vehicular movement on the stretch went for a toss for over an hour during the day.

With the rise in COVID-19 positive cases, the Kerala authorities said that as a precautionary measure, they would permit only those people, who had a certificate stating that they had tested negative to the virus. Also, the e-pass was made mandatory.

However, workers from Theni district, who are working in Kumuli, Sakkupallam, Vandanmedu, Nedungandam, Cumbum Mettu and among other areas, said that they had obtained the e-pass as instructed by the Kerala authorities for a period of six months. But, the ‘sudden’ announcement to have COVID-19 negative certificates took them by shock. As the police personnel at the check post were clear on seeing the certificate, the workers returned.

As they came near Cumbum (Siluvaikoil) by pass, they resorted to a road blockade. As the news spread, Cumbum North Police officials came to the spot and held talks. As the workers insisted that they would give up the stir only if they were allowed to go for work, the TN police held talks with their counterparts to permit the workers to go for work today with the e-pass.

Following this, the workers went for their jobs in the cardamom estates.","It is a temporary phenomenon, say bus operators

Omni buses operate with full capacity during the day as night buses stood cancelled due to the night curfew in the state. Bus operators, however, say that their business was taking a hit and demanded compensation from the government.

At least five buses operated by different travel agencies ran at full capacity to both Chennai and Bengaluru on Wednesday morning, hours after the night curfew was lifted. ‘The crowd is temporary. They are travelling to Chennai for work. After the first few days, we will run empty buses,’ a bus operator said.

Some passengers were rushing to various places along the Chennai route such as Villupuram, as many had been given work-from-home options and were returning home. ‘We were ready to travel last night but due to the night curfew, we had to wait for a bus in the morning,’ said M. Sivaprakash, a techie in the city.

The bus services at the Omni bus stand stop by afternoon, as the buses must reach their destination before 10 pm. ‘Our last bus to Chennai is at 2 p.m. while buses to Bengaluru stop by noon,’ a bus operator said.

The passengers and bus operators agreed that travelling during the day was inconvenient. ‘We are forced to travel through the day wasting an entire day on a bus. When travelling during night, one reaches the destination in the morning and is ready for the work the next day,’ he said.

The summer heat making several stops for food and lunch and having to halt at the destination for nearly 12 hours inconveniences the bus operators, they said.

R. Balakrishnan, president, Tiruchi Omni Bus Operators Association, said that their business has taken a severe beating over the last year. ‘Only around December till February did we have some travellers. Since March, it has come down once again,’ he said.

Representatives of various omni bus operators associations across the state had met the Transport Commissioner on Tuesday seeking their intervention. The representatives sought waivers in road tax, loans taken against the buses. ‘We have told them that by May 1 if the night curfew persists, we will stop our services entirely,’ he said.","The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday summoned Tirunelveli Corporation Commissioner and Joint Director of Town and Country Planning Department, Tirunelveli, in response to a public interest litigation petition on unauthorised construction of a building at Palayamkottai in the district.

A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and S. Ananthi summoned the officials and directed them to be present before the court during the next hearing via video conferencing in order to ascertain the facts of the case. The status report submitted by authorities confirmed the building violation.

The court was hearing the PIL plea filed by S. Ferdin Rayan of Palayamkottai, who complained that the building, V.J. Hospital, was built in violation of the approved plan. Mandatory safety measures and requirements were not followed. Under the circumstances, the owner of the hospital was putting up additional construction on adjacent land, extending the existing structure.

He said that through an RTI reply he found out that the building plan approval was obtained for a commercial building. Instead, a hospital was functioning there.

He sought direction to authorities concerned to take steps against the illegal/unauthorised construction. Also, legal action must be taken against those involved.

In a status report submitted to the court, the Joint Director of Town and Country Planning Department said the plan was approved for construction of a commercial shop building (medical). After the approval, a hospital was built which exceeded the approved area. Permission was granted to take action against the unauthorised construction and a notice was issued to the hospital owner.

The judges adjourned the case for further hearing by a week.","The central region reported 930 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday with patients from the districts of Nagapattinam, Tiruchi, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur recording more than 70% of them.

Five deaths were reported in the region - two each in Ariyalur and Tiruchi, and one in Nagapattinam. A 49-year-old man with no pre-existing ailments and a 60-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease, both hailing from Ariyalur, succumbed to COVID-19. Two men aged 70 and 48, both diagnosed with diabetes from Tiruchi, and an 80-year-old woman from Nagapattinam with no pre-existing ailments, succumbed to the infection.

Tiruchi reported the highest number of cases on Wednesday with 357 fresh cases. Despite the high number of fresh cases, no new areas were demarcated as containment zones, officials in the Tiruchi Corporation said. Thanjavur district reported 179, Tiruvarur, 99 and Nagapattinam, 95. Karur district also recorded a sharp spurt with 85 fresh cases.

Pudukottai district reported 62 patients testing positive and Ariyalur 43. Perambalur district reported 10 fresh cases.","Seeking permission for performing folk arts during temple festivals up to midnight, the folk artistes submitted a petition at the Collectorate on Wednesday.

Led by their president Pon Pandi and secretary T. A. Sudalai Kani, members of Confederation of Folk Artistes Welfare Association of Tirunelveli District, submitted the petition even as good number of ‘karagam’ exponents performed in the traditional attire.

The petitioners said that the lives of over 4,000 folk artistes of the district that had got affected due to the pandemic in last March was yet to improve as the restrictions on performance during temple festival was continuing. Even as the artistes were eagerly waiting for the new season that would usually start in Chiththirai, the first month of Tamil calendar, the latest round of restrictions had wiped-out their hopes.

“We used to get offers during temple festivals organised between ‘Panguni’ and ‘Vaikaasi’ wherein we used to perform between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. Since the Tamil Nadu Government has imposed restrictions in the wake of pandemic, no one has received offers so far, thus leaving our families in the lurch. Considering our pathetic condition, the State Government should allow us to perform during the temple festivals at least up to midnight. Or, the government should give us ₹10,000 per artiste for the loss we’re facing now even though they have not registered their names with the welfare board,” Mr. Pon Pandi said.","Former Radhapuram MLA M. Apapvu has appealed to the State Government to increase the quantum of diesel and allowance being given to Government hospitals and primary health centres for sending the COVID-19 test samples to the testing centres so as to get the results at the earliest and ensure proper treatment to the people on time.

In a memorandum submitted to Chief Secretary Rajiv Ranjan on Wednesday, Mr. Appavu said Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital, 10 Ggovernment hospitals and 44 primary health centres across the district were catering to the needs of the people during this pandemic. When the samples are collected in the PHCs, it should be taken to the testing centre within the stipulated time for which the government has allowed ₹5,000 and 55 litres of diesel per month, which is insufficient.

Consequently, results of the tests and the treatment of the positive patients are getting delayed and they are forced to be in home quarantine as medical facility in their area is limited.

Moreover, proper steps should be taken immediately to screen a few thousand contract labourers working with Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, Indian Space Research Organisation’s Propulsion Research Complex at Mahendragiri in the district.

Hence, the State Government should take steps to install more number of testing equipment. The quantum of diesel being given for the Medical Officers for sending the test samples to the testing facility should be increased. Sufficient number of personnel should be appointed in the PHCs to take care of the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in home quarantine, Mr. Appavu said.","It can last only two days as 4,000 persons are being vaccinated daily

Six days after several vaccination centres in Virudhunagar district ran out of stocks, the district on Wednesday received 10,500 doses, a meagre quantity of Covishield vaccine, which can last only for two days.

With the district having 95 vaccination centres, including private hospitals, the present stock will not be sufficient to continue with vaccination beyond two days.

While the district had been administering vaccines to around 4,000 persons every day, the administration had planned to increase the daily vaccination to 7,500 doses, as per the district Monitoring Officer S. Madhumathi.

“Already, all vaccination centres have a backlog for thousands of people who were scheduled to get their second dose, but could not get them in many centres for the last six days. The present stock cannot even fulfill the backlog requirements,” an official said.

Every day people have been visiting the centres and returning home disappointed.

The official said that private hospitals were facing more pressure as they had either collected the money for second dosage in advance or had issued tokens with details of schedule for second dose.

People who had been administered Covaxin injection have been given the second dosage too. The district had received very limited quantity of Covaxin.

A senior doctor expressed apprehension about sudden surge in demand for the vaccine after the Centre opened up vaccination for all persons above 18 years from May 1.

A senior official at a Government hospital in the district said that all those who returned home due to lack of vaccine had registered their names along with phone numbers in the last six days.

“We will send reminder through SMS to those people in the order of their visit and they would be given preference during the vaccination. In all probability, the meagre doses will be exhausted on Thursday,” he added.

However, a senior medical officer exuded hope that more doses will arrive soon.

The spurt in number of COVID-19 positive persons has driven people, who were hesitant to take the jab, to get vaccinted.","A fresh consignment of 24,300 Covishield doses were received at the Tiruchi Regional Vaccine Storage on Wednesday. Of it, 10,410 doses have been released for use across the district for the next three days while the remaining 13,890 has been reserved until further instructions are provided by the Directorate of Public Health.

On Wednesday, only 2830 doses of Covishield were available for usage. However, after the consignment was received, there would be no shortage, a senior health official said. Notwithstanding the reserved 13,980 doses, the vaccine stock would last until the end of this week, he added.

On Wednesday, only 1786 people received vaccine shots, of which 1103 were people taking their second dose. ‘This is because we had reserved most of the doses for people coming to get their second dose. But with the new delivery, we will be able to vaccinate everyone till the end of this week,’ a senior health official said.

Meanwhile, 2020 doses of Covaxin remain and will be distributed to people taking the second dose only.","Tirunelveli

Seeking justice in the gruesome murder of a temple priest on Sunday, members belonging to the Yadava community staged a road roko near the Collectorate on Wednesday that paralysed vehicular traffic on this busy road near MGR Statue at Kokkirakulam for a while.

Though the agitation was withdrawn after the police pacified the protestors, the family of the deceased refused to accept the body of murdered priest Chidambaram.

After Chidambaram, administering the Sudalai Maadan Temple at Seevalaperi near here, was murdered by an armed gang on Sunday evening, tension prevails in the village as the assailants were from a different community.

Subsequently, seven persons were arrested.

Against this backdrop, over 150 youths of Yadava community came to the Collectorate on Wednesday to submit a petition. Besides giving ₹20 lakh as compensation to the family of the deceased and the injured, the government should give employment to a family member of Chidambaram, they said and added that the government should ensure the safety of Sudalai Maadan Temple.","With 484 fresh cases, it crossed the last highest tally of 386 recorded in July last year

Tirunelveli

Tirunelveli

district, which has so far lost 225 of its citizens to COVID-19, recorded its highest number of infections in a day with 484 fresh cases on Wednesday. The district’s last highest single day tally of 386 was recorded in July.

Of the 484 new patients, 226 are from Tirunelveli Corporation area and the remaining are from rural areas.

The Corporation has created mini containment zones in the areas where the COVID-19 positive cases have been reported and is carrying out disinfection works.

Though a section of the workforce including the staff and contract labourers of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project (KKNPP) and Indian Space Research Organisation’s Propulsion Research Complex at Mahendragiri in the district have tested positive for COVID-19, the exact number of persons who contracted the viral infection has not been given to the media.

A source in KKNPP said more than 150 contract labourers and staff had tested positive for COVID-19.

Operation of buses

After restrictions on operation of buses came into force from Tuesday, the State Express Transport Corporation operated five buses to Chennai, a bus each to Tirupathi and Villupuram, all with 20 passengers each. Similarly, buses were operated to Erode, Coimbatore, Hosur and Vellore also. Though SETC has kept its fleet ready, the buses are being operated to far-off destinations based on demand.

The Government Museum near District Police Office has been closed for visitors due to the pandemic.

Thoothukudi

In Thoothukudi, the COVID-19 vaccination section, which was functioning on Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital premises has been shifted to the nursing college campus due to unmanageable crowds thronging the facility every day for vaccination.

Collector K. Senthil Raj said ‘kabasurakudineer’ was being given to the people living in the containment zones besides carrying out disinfection operations.

“Moreover, ‘fever clinics’ will be conducted as usual across the district in areas identified by the Department of Public Health including Thoothukudi Corporation area,” he said.","Seventy-one isolation coaches were available in Tiruchi Railway Division to move them where they may be required to accommodate COVID 19 patients.

The coaches will be moved based on instructions from the Southern Railway headquarters upon receipt of request from the State government. The coaches were kept at Villupuram, Thanjavur, Sillakudi and Ariyalur with modifications and facilities created in each one of them.

Several sleeper class coaches and general compartments which were being deployed in express and passenger trains were converted into isolation coaches to accommodate those requiring quarantine facilities. These compartments were converted into isolation coaches at various places including at Golden Rock Railway Workshop in Tiruchi as well as in Tiruchi Division last year when the viral infection began to spread.

The middle berths have been removed from the sleeper class coaches while converting them as isolation compartments. Each isolation coach could accommodate eight to 16 persons.

Each coach has nine bays with the first bay meant for para-medical staff and for keeping oxygen cylinders and medicines. Each bay has been provided with three types of dustbins with the windows covered with mosquito nets. Coat hooks and bottle holders have also been provided inside the coaches in which liquid soap dispensers were provided in the toilets and wash basins. One toilet had been converted into a bathroom and provided with a stool and a bucket. The place where the para-medical staff would be deployed would be covered with a nylon curtain. The isolation coaches have also been equipped with fire extinguishers.

The Golden Rock Railway Workshop which is engaged in periodic maintenance of broad gauge compartments and diesel locomotives had modified 111 sleeper class and general compartments into isolation coaches.","Farmers have been advised to adopt biological or mechanical methods or spray chemicals to control the black bug menace on paddy crop noticed in certain parts of the delta.

In a press release, V.Ambethgar, director, Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute, Aduthurai, said that the institute received information that the presence of Scotinophara lurida (Burmeister), known as rice black bug (RBB) or psunami vandu in local parlance, was noticed on the paddy crop particularly in the coastal areas and it was multiplying rapidly.

The pest attacks the rice plant at almost all the stages of growth and results in severe to complete crop loss during heavy infestation.

If a rice plant was infested with about 10 to 15 RBB per hill, then it could cause a yield loss of around 25 per cent.

Pointing out that the study of RBB carried out for about a decade has revealed that these insects were noticed in the fields during or after a full moon period, he said that it was ascertained that the full moon cycle affects the RBB’s flight activity. Farmers were advised to adopt light trapping technology since the RBBs are highly attracted to the high intensity of light.

Light trapping of bugs could be adopted two days before or until three days after full moon period from 8 p.m. to midnight for better and effective results, he added.

As these bugs are susceptible to biological control agents like Bevariana basiana and Metarhizium anisopliae and counter checked by the presence of parasitoids such as coccinellids, trichogramma, telenomus and spiders it was suggested to adopt these biological control methods also.

In case if humid weather condition prevails in the late season of the crop, insecticides can be used on the need basis, he said. For effective results, the spraying of 100 ml of monocrotophos per hectare or 625 grams of acephate per hectare or need seed kernel extract at the bottom portion of the hill should be carried out. If further details required, the farmers could contact the Institutes’s Assistant Professor (Agriculture Entomology), P.Anandhi (0435 – 2472108).","Communist Party of India (Marxist) members staged a protest seeking adequate supply of COVID-19 vaccines and life-saving drug Remdesivir in Government hospitals here on Wednesday.

The protest was led by the party’s town secretary B. Mariappan.

Mr. Mariappan charged that Rajapalayam Government hospital has run out of vaccine for the last four days. “Even today, people had to return home with disappointment as the hospital authorities said that they did not have stocks of vaccine,” he said.

Besides, the party was opposed to Centre’s move of allowing State Governments to procure vaccine. The Centre should ensure that all people got vaccines free of cost.

Stating that the acknowledgement of having taken the vaccine in the form of SMS was not being delivered on time on the mobile phones, Mr. Mariappan said that he received the message only eight days after he had taken the first dose.

Besides, the SMS did not have any details on the next dose.

“The SMS is the only acknowledgement for the people of having got vaccinated. If something untoward happens, the vaccinated person would not have any record of proof for vaccination,” he said.

Mr. Mariappan alleged that Remdesivir was also not available in adequate quantity in Government hospitals.

The administration should also take steps to increase the number of swab tests, he added.","The children are being taught by students, in association with an NGO, the importance of mask wearing and washing their hands regularly, among other safety norms

In the wake of many children getting infected with COVID-19, a group of college students, along with an NGO, have started creating awareness about basic COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) among adolescents and children below the age of 12 at the Semmenchery resettlement colony.

The nine students, from Stella Maris and Patrician College, are pursuing their master’s programmes in social work and have been interning with Thozhamai, an NGO in Semmenchery. Over the last two days they have been creating awareness about basic measures that need to be followed to keep the novel coronavirus at bay.

“There have been reports that many children are getting infected. But there are no proper awareness programmes on wearing masks, hand washing and personal distancing targeting children. So we thought it was pertinent to educate children till the age of 17 in Semmenchery,"" said A. Devanyean, director, Thozhamai.

Prathipa K., a first year student from Stella Maris College, said that they were surprised to know that many teenagers in Semmenchery did not know the importance of washing their hands properly. “They were using just water. We told them that it was not enough and taught them the proper way of doing it. We also taught them how to wear their masks properly and wash them regularly, told them about drinking hot water and maintaining personal distancing. Many of their parents do not have sufficient time to teach them all these norms,” she said.

S. Chandralekha, a class 10 student in Semmenchery who attended the programme, said that she greatly benefited from it. ""As schools and colleges are closed, many children are out on the roads with their friends. After this they directly go home. This programme was an eye opener,” she said.

K. Kanchana, project coordinator, Thozhamai, said that even children below the age of 12 are taught at the micro-education centres in the locality. “This will be an ongoing process. We have to keep reminding the children to wear masks and keep washing their hands,” she said.","The deaths took place at Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, allegedly following a snag in oxygen supply

The State Human Rights Commission on Wednesday called for a report from authorities over a media report that four patients had died in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, allegedly following a snag in oxygen supply.

SHRC member D. Jayachandran took suo motu cognisance of the incident and called for a report from the Director of Medical Education and the Dean of Vellore Medical College Hospital within two weeks.

According to the media report, four patients, who were undergoing treatment at the hospital, died following a snag in the oxygen supply. The report also stated that three other patients with COVID-19 died in the hospital on the same day.

The report said the oxygen supply was disrupted but was eventually restored. It also quoted the hospital administration, which maintained that the disruption in oxygen supply was not the reason behind the deaths.","The man was under the influence of alcohol, police said

A 38-year-old man who allegedly attacked police personnel of a patrolling team, was arrested by the Nandambakkam police on Wednesday.

Police said the control room received a call informing them that a man, under the influence of alcohol, was creating a ruckus by brandishing a knife in Nethaji Nagar. Beat patrolling officer and sub-inspector Vivekanandar and police driver Sakthivel from Nandambakkam police reached the spot immediately. When Mr. Vivekanandar tried to nab the man, he allegedly tore his uniform and attacked him using the knife. Mr. Sakthivel who tried to prevent the attack was also attacked by the man.

As many as 14, 819 cases were booked against violators who failed to adhere to physical distancing in public places across the State.","Twin Twigs, run by brothers Sriram and Sunder Ram, offers handicrafts made by people with disabilities

It all started with the bauhinia leaves.

Ten years ago, Sunder Ram and Sriram Ramesh, 30-year-old twin brothers with cerebral palsy, a congenital neurological impairment, discovered a business idea in the mantharai plant. Dried, stitched by hand, and moulded by a machine, these leaves could be used as cups, saucers, plates, bowls and tumblers. Not only would they smell good, but they would also be eco-friendly. And most important of all, the business would help the twins become self reliant.

In January 2021, Sunder and Sriram realised their dream by opening a gift shop of products made by people with disabilities, under the brand name, Twin Twigs, in Navallur.

“We sell our leaf plates, along with wooden, cane and terracotta products, crockery, marble paintings, and cloth bags,” says Sunder, who is the point person at the shop.

Sriram, on the other hand, is more interested in the manufacturing aspect of things; they have a unit to mould plates, attached to their home. Before the pandemic, they had up to 10 people at the factory employed under them. They are partnered by their friend, K Karthikeyan, who also helps them with their special needs.

Their mother Radha Ramesh explains further, “Sunder is the one who likes dealing with people and taking orders, as his interpersonal skills are more developed. Sriram is more routine oriented, so he supervises the manufacturing.”

Radha has been instrumental in setting up the business. When her children were toddlers, Radha went to Vidya Sagar (formerly The Spastics Society of India) in Kotturpuram to become a special educator. “I did not want to be dependent on anyone to understand them,” she says. Soon, she became a teacher there, and is now the Director at Vidya Sagar.

Sunder and Sriram too, were given ‘life skills training’ there. No formal schooling meant they can not read or write, but that does not stop them from their chosen career as entrepreneurs.

“They use apps that incorporate assistive technology to suit their needs. Instead of letters, data can be input pictorially, and the app does the calculation,” says Radha.

At the shop, the footfall is the highest during the weekends. “With Twin Twigs, they wanted to create a platform for the products made by people with disabilities,” says Radha, translating for Sriram. The products on sale here are procured from all parts of India, including organisations for people with disabilities such as Vidya Sagar in Chennai, Umang School in Jaipur and Koshish in Delhi. Radha’s contacts at Vidya Sagar came in handy while building this network.

Despite the setback of the pandemic, Sriram and Sunder are persevering. “We want to expand this unit so that it provides more employment opportunities to disabled as well as non-disabled people. This is just the start,” they say.

Twin Twigs is at D5, OMR Bazaar Street, Navallur. Contact 9444060993.","The party staged a protest demanding that vaccines and the drug Remdesivir be made available at the government hospital

Communist Party of India (Marxist) cadre staged protest on Wednesday, seeking adequate supply of COVID-19 vaccines and life-saving Remdesivir injections at the government hospitals here.

The protest was led by the party town secretary, B. Mariappan.

Mr. Mariappan charged that Rajapalayam government hospital has run out of vaccines for the last four days. “Even today, people had to return home disappointed, as the hospital authorities said that they did not have stocks of vaccine,” he said.

Besides, the party was opposed to the Centre’s move of allowing State gvernments to procure vaccine. The Centre should ensure that all people got vaccines free of cost, he said.

Stating that the acknowledgement of having taken the vaccine in the form of SMS was not delivered on the mobile phones on time, Mr. Mariappan said that he himself had received the message only eight days after he had taken the first dose. Besides, the SMS did not have any details about the next dose, he said.

Mr. Mariappan also alleged that Remdesivir was not available in adequate quantities in government hospitals.

The administration should also take steps to increase the number of swab tests too, he said.","The two headmasters were asked to deposit money in the accounts of parents of Advisai students, but parents have complained that the money has not reached them

Two headmasters of Government Tribal Schools (GTR) in Gudalur were suspended after allegations of misappropriation of funds meant for Adivasi students, surfaced.

According to sources in the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, two headmasters of the Devala and Ponnani GTR schools were accused of misappropriating funds meant for around 45 students at the schools. “Each student was to receive ₹7,300, which would have been spent by the Department on food and lodging. The headmasters were asked to deposit the money in the accounts of the students’ parents,” said an official requesting anonymity.

The money was for students who usually stay at the residential schools but were unable to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The two headmasters – Bakkiyasenan and Sekar, were alleged to have misappropriated the funds by depositing the money into the accounts of non-beneficiaries. Complaints were raised by the parents with the Department and an inquiry was conducted.

Officials said that investigations revealed that the money was not credited into the accounts of the beneficiaries. “As the students are from Adivasi communities, many parents do not have bank accounts. The two headmasters’ defence is that the money was deposited into the accounts of the students’ relatives who did have bank accounts,” said the source.

When contacted, Suganthi Parimalam, district Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare officer, confirmed that the two headmasters had been suspended. “We are continuing our investigations into the allegations made by the parents. We are now taking efforts to make sure that the money reaches the proper beneficiaries,” she said, adding that the more than 20 other GTR schools in the district too will be investigated.","The arrested were villagers near Masinagudi who were cattle owners

After an investigation spanning over five months, the Forest department arrested two men who allegedly poisoned a carcass that killed an adult tigress in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). The death of the tigress resulted in two cubs being orphaned. The cubs were taken to the Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Chennai to be raised in captivity.

The forest department identified the accused as Ahmed Kabeer, from Achakarai and B. Kariyan, from Kurumbarpadi, both villages located near Masinagudi in the MTR buffer zone. Two others, identified as S. Saddam, and Shaukat Ali, are absconding.

Speaking to The Hindu, L.C.S.Srikanth, Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone), said that all four accused were cattle owners whose livestock were occasionally being lifted by wildlife. “Though they had not targeted any one animal in particular, they wanted to poison the carnivore that was attacking their livestock,” said Mr. Srikanth.

Mr. Srikanth said that the investigation took a very long time to complete as they had to wait for test results of the stomach contents of the tiger, and collecting evidence. “Mr. Kariyan had been absconding since the incident happened. He returned a few days back to attend a function, when we detained him for questioning. We managed to piece together more evidence based on his testimony and have arrested one of the men who was also responsible,” said Mr. Srikanth.

With the latest arrests, the Forest department has cracked three major cases relating to wildlife crimes in the tiger reserve that have occurred in the last 12 months, including a poisoning that led to the death of five Asiatic wild dogs and the elephant burning case, where the owners of a private resort threw a burning projectile on the animal, leading it to sustain serious burn injuries and eventually dying. One of the accused in the case, Ricky Rayan, is absconding three months after the incident took place.","A major dig is taking place at Maligaimedu site to know more about the royal palace and capital of King Rajendra Chola I.

The State Department of Archaeology has made some encouraging finds less than two months into the excavation at Maligaimedu near Gangaikondacholapuram, the capital of King Rajendra Chola I.

“Thirteen coarse brick walls have been exposed so far at the site. A copper coin, some potsherds and iron pieces have been collected. Besides, a piece of Chinese celedon ware, belonging to 10-11th century, has also been found,” R.Sivanandam, Deputy Director of Archaeology, told The Hindu.

“We have to send the coin for chemical cleaning but going by its circular shape we can assume it is a Chola period one. The presence of celedon ware is indicative of the trade ties that had existed [between the two countries] then,” Mr.Sivanandam said. “We have to dig further to assess the brick structures fully ” he added.

Gangaikondacholapuram was established by King Rajendra Chola I (1012-1044 CE) after his victorious expedition up to the Gangetic plains. Excavations conducted earlier at Maligaimedu had revealed the remains of a royal palace. The previous excavations were carried out at the site on a smaller scale on six occasions when portions of the Rajendra Chola’s palace were unearthed. Antiques and other items found in the excavations are on display at a museum at Gangaikondacholapuram.

The present excavation at the site began towards the end of February after conducting surveys using drone, thermal camers and ground penetrating radars, with the help of various agencies. Excavation is now underway at five trenches at the site. The department is looking to take up exploration on a larger scale now to find out more about the palace, the city and its streets.

The site is one of the seven identified for excavation in the State by the department. In January, T.Udayachandran, Principal Secretary and Commissioner of the Department, had announced plans to launch excavations at the seven sites after the projects were granted permission by the Central Advisory Board for Archaeology (CABA).

The excavation at the site is conducted under the supervision of S.Nandakumar, Director of site, and K.Bagyalakshmi, co-director, Umayal and Subhalakshmi, Archaeological Officers, besides three research assistants. About 30-40 workers are engaged in the excavation, which will go on till the beginning of the monsoon this season.","Special police team arrests accused

The K.G. Chavadi police on Monday arrested a 63-year-old man on charges of murdering an 80-year-old man at Pichanur within the limits of K.G. Chavadi police station on April 3.

C. A. Varatharajan of Dam Thottam Road at Walayar was arrested by a police team led by Madukkarai inspector.

According to the police, Varatharajan was wanted in connection with the murder of Karuppasamy Gounder, a resident of Van Tex Mill road at Pichanur.

Gounder was found murdered at the cow shed in the land belonging to his younger brother Ramakrishnan at Pichanur.

Mr. Ramakrishnan had seen Gounder grazing cows at the place at noon. He found Gounder lying dead on a cot near the cow shed when he returned around 4 p.m. The K.G. Chavadi police registered a case on the complaint lodged by Gounder’s son Shanmuga Sundaram.

During the course of investigation, the police found that Gounder’s cows had entered a nearby farm that was taken on lease by Varatharajan’s brother and he picked a quarrel with Gounder over it. During the argument, Varatharajan assaulted the elderly man with a knife in which he died, the police said.

The special team apprehended Varatharajan who was hiding in a farm taken care by his brother on Walayar Dam Road. He was produced before a magistrate who remanded him in judicial custody.

Booked for misbehaving with Corpn. workers

The Rathinapuri police on Tuesday booked a 45-year-old man, who misbehaved with the Corporation workers, when they went to his house for COVID-19 preventive works. The police said Vasagan of Third Street at Gandhipuram was booked following a complaint by the health inspector of Corporation’s central zone.

The police said Corporation workers led by ward health supervisor Anandhan had gone to Vasagan’s house and asked certain details. However, he behaved harshly, threatened them and threw a flower pot at them, said the police. A Corporation worker shot a video of his acts on mobile phone which was widely circulated in social media.","Those who skip it without medical reason can’t get special leave if they catch virus

Days after circulars issued by Southern Railway and the Integral Coach Factory, asking staff to take the COVID-19 vaccine or proceed on leave triggered a controversy, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Chennai, has asked its employees to compulsorily get the jab.

In a circular issued on Monday, the MTC’s general manager said that if employees failed to take the vaccine without a doctor’s approval for any specific medical reason, they would not be entitled to special medical leave if they test positive for COVID-19. He said the Transport Department was a service sector working directly with the people.

Drivers and conductors had to be in close proximity to thousands of people on a daily basis, he said. “With the onset of the second wave of COVID-19, the State government has advised compulsory vaccination — either Covishield or Covaxin — for all those aged 45 and above to protect them from the virus,” he said.

‘Sensitise staff’

Senior officials, supervisors and others were told to sensitise employees aged 45 and above and take steps to ensure that they get vaccinated. All transport employees should wear masks, maintain physical distance and follow other safety norms, the official said.

Centre of Indian Trade Unions Transport Federation general secretary Arumuga Nainar said it was not correct on the part of the management to force the staff to get the jab.

Instead, awareness camps should be organised to educate the employees on the benefits of vaccination, and they should be persuaded to take the vaccine, he said.

“The vaccination drive covering the 18,000-strong workforce should be planned in such a way that an employee gets the jab the day before his/her weekly off. In case anyone develops fever or pain, an additional day’s rest or leave should be allowed. The same pattern of vaccination should be followed for all State Transport Undertakings,” Mr. Nainar said.

After the Railways issued a similar order, the All India Railwaymen’s Federation protested against the move and urged the general manager of Southern Railway and the Integral Coach Factory to withdraw the circulars, arguing that there was no provision to force employees to get vaccinated.","Consumers in South Chennai, especially those covered by supplies from Aavin's Sholinganallur dairy, are complaining about confusion caused by the printing of the use-by date on milk packets. The milk major usually prints the same day's date in morning supplies, which is around 12 lakh litres daily and the next day's date for evening supplies in select areas in the city. However, for over two weeks now, consumers in areas like Chitlapakkam, Perungudi and Thoraipakkam are seeing packets with the next day's date in their morning supply.

Consumer activist T. Sadagopan said that this was causing problems since vendors were saying the life of the milk was longer than usual. ""If that is the case then why won't Aavin do the same with milk from other diaries as well? We are forced to question the genuineness of the product,"" he said.

S. A. Ponnusamy of the milk retailers association said that his members had received complaints of spoilage from consumers for the early morning supplies itself. ""The dates are confusing. Why can't they just say evening packs if they are supplying in the evening,"" he asked.

Aavin officials said they had not received any complaints of excess spoilage from anywhere in the city. They said the issue of varying dates would be set right shortly.","The Accountant General’s office on Tuesday conceded before the Madras High Court that there were indeed malpractices in the examination conducted for Divisional Accountant posts in the State Highways Department and that the results of as many as 16 candidates were cancelled. The State government too informed the court that it had demoted certain erring officials and initiated departmental proceedings against them.

The submissions were made when a public interest litigation petition seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the issue was listed for admission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy. Advocate M.L. Ravi of Desiya Makkal Sakthi Katchi had filed the case insisting that a probe should be conducted on all exams conducted by the AG’s office for the post since 2016.

He pointed out that the Divisional Accountant’s post in highways department was a significant assignment involving passing of bills by contractors. Since the State government allots around Rs. 20,000 crore a year to the highways department, the candidates indulge in all sorts of malpractices to clear the examinations and occupy the post, he said and insisted upon an independent probe to bring out all irregularities to light.

In reply, a counsel representing the A-G’s office, said there were indeed certain malpractices in the examinations and that the results of as many as 16 candidates were cancelled. He sought time to put his submissions in writing by way of a counter affidavit. State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan too said that the government had initiated departmental proceedings. Hence, the judges adjourned the case for filing of counter affidavits.","The Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed a public interest litigation petition, which sought to exempt a section of fishermen from using the banned purse seine nets.

The court refused to grant any such exemption after observing that the court would not interfere in an informed decision taken by the State government to ban the nets in toto to conserve marine resources.

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy rejected the PIL petition filed by Fishermen Care, a private organisation, after observing that the State government, in its counter affidavit, had categorically stated that it was only the affluent fishermen owning mechanised fishing boats who use purse seine nets to scoop out fish from the territorial waters.

The judges said it was the prerogative of the executive to take decisions in public interest and for the long-term benefits of fishermen and that the scope of judicial review would not allow the court to supplant its views over the executive opinion founded on expert advice. Observing that the government had provided cogent reasons for having banned the use of purse seine nets, the Bench refused to interfere in such a decision.

They also pointed out that another Division Bench of the High Court had, on February 5, 2019, upheld the validity of a Government Order banning the use of purse seine nets.","The Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services has instructed all empanelled private hospitals to set aside at least 50% of total beds for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The Meteorological Department has forecast that thunderstorms are likely to continue over Western Ghats districts and northwest parts of the State till Saturday.

A north-south trough running up to interior Tamil Nadu across Vidarbha between 0.9 km and 1.5 km above mean sea level triggered thunderstorm activity over parts of the State.

During the past 24 hours ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, Pechiparai, Perunchani dam and Puthan dam in Kanniyakumari district received 7 cm of rain, the highest amount in a single day.

Officials of the Meteorological Department said there would be scattered rain on Wednesday in various districts, including Salem, Tiruchi, Erode, Madurai and Krishnagiri. One or two places in the Western Ghats districts have a chance of thunderstorms with heavy rain, owing to the wind instabilities.

However, thunderstorms may cover a lesser area from April 22 and would be limited to the Western Ghats districts. Dry weather may prevail over other parts of the State and Puducherry, and residents may feel sultry weather as humidity levels may be around 50%-80%.

Hot weather

Day temperatures had breached 40 degrees in some districts, including Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai, on Monday.

On Tuesday, southerly and south-easterly winds that prevailed during the most part of the day helped in bringing down the soaring day temperature. Tiruchi and Vellore recorded the highest day temperature of 39 degree Celsius.

The weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam registered 35.5 degree Celsius and 37.4 degree Celsius. Residents may have felt uncomfortable weather as the humidity level was at 79%.

Officials noted that thunderstorms would occur due to convective activity, which was seasonal.

The change in wind pattern and dry weather also influenced peaking temperature.","Loyola College celebrated its 96th College Day on April 17.

The police have recovered 1,382 mobile phones that were reported to be either missing or stolen and handed them over to their respective owners on Tuesday.

City Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal handed over some of the recovered phones to their owners. Deputy Commissioners in 12 police districts in the city handed over the rest of the mobile phones.

Mr. Aggarwal said, “People were upset after losing their mobile phones as so much crucial data, including personal pictures, are stored on them. Though the missing of phone cannot be taken as crime, police personnel duly receive the complaints of the public and act on those complaints.”

Using cyber crime cells, all complaints of snatching or missing mobiles phones were taken up for investigation. “We have followed all those complaints. Using IMEI numbers, we have tracked phones and recovered 3,962 mobile phones since July 2020. The financial value of those recovered items could be around ₹4.39 crore,” he said.

Mr. Aggarwal said the special initiative to trace missing and stolen mobile phones with the help of cyber crime cells began in July 2020.

As many as 1, 350 mobile phones worth ₹1.38 crore were recovered last September and 1,230 cellphones worth ₹1.46 crore were recovered last December.

He said the cyber crime cells in all 12 police districts were functioning under the direct supervision of the respective Deputy Commissioners. He added that the cells have received 7,400 complaints. Over ₹2.80 crore cash lost to online fraudsters had been retrieved and returned to the complainants so far. Seven call centres which were indulging in fraudulent acts were sealed, he added.","A special court for exclusive trial of cases against MLAs and MPs acquitted DMK MLA M.K.

A release said the 39-year-old patient was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease four years ago, which affected the small intestines, causing severe ulcers, abdominal pain and weight loss.

Despite medication, the recurring nature of the disease resulted in ulcers and weight loss of more than 6 kg in four months, the release added.

S. Arulprakash, senior consultant and clinical lead - gastroenterology and hepatology, MGM Healthcare, said after a detailed examination, it was decided that an enteroscopy would be performed using the novel motorised spiral equipment.

“A narrowed part of the intestine was dilated. This new endoscopic technique helped us in avoiding a major surgical procedure that would have included removal of the affected part of the intestine. This special endoscope considerably reduced the procedure time and allowed us to have an increased depth of insertion as compared to existing technologies,” he added.","Residents, motorists inconvenienced by smoke pollution

Motorists travelling on the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road were affected by smoke-induced pollution after a fire engulfed the garbage transit yard.

Mounds of unsegregated garbage have been piling up in the garbage segregation yard belonging to Pallavaram Municipality, with waste strewn on the road margins. Early on Tuesday, a fire in the garbage yard resulted in thick smoke polluting the nearby localities, causing hardship to residents and motorists. With several high-rise residential apartments and commercial establishments on the radial road, the fire inconvenienced thousands of residents. It was later put out by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services personnel. Malini Narasimhan, a resident of a multi-storeyed apartment on the radial road, said the thick smoke emanating from the garbage dumpyard caused headache and breathing problems.

She wanted the municipal authorities to take steps to prevent such fire accidents in the future.

Rise in incidents

Social activist V. Santhanam complained about frequent fire accidents occurring in the garbage transit yard, and said officials were yet to take any preventive steps.

Noting that garbage was dumped in Putheri lake, located near the transit yard, in January, he said the municipality was yet to take stringent action to prevent such incidents.","Purohit wants them to make use of students’ potential to create awareness

State universities should be front-runners in creating awareness in society of COVID-19-appropriate behaviour, Governor-Chancellor Banwarilal Purohit said.

He urged the universities to disseminate information regarding the need to wear masks, sanitise hands and prevent the spread of infection among students, besides popularising vaccination in society.

During a virtual meeting with the Vice-Chancellors of the 21 State universities on Tuesday, Mr. Purohit urged teachers should educate students on the COVID-19 safety norms during online classes.","The Greater Chennai Corporation is planning to permit the private sector to start COVID-19 Care Centres for patients with mild symptoms.

Private hospitals have been asked to contact the Corporation for getting permission to run the private care centres through tie-ups with private hotels or other agencies that own property.

Currently, the Corporation has more than 12,000 beds in COVID-19 Care Centres. Of them, 1,487 beds are occupied. With the city registering more than 3,700 cases every day, the demand for care centres is expected to increase. Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash on Tuesday announced that the civic body would give clearance for private COVID-19 Care Centres.

“Blanket clearance has been given to the private sector to start private care centres with the required medical team and infrastructure,” he said.

Ensuring more facilities

“This is to ensure more facilities across the city in a short span of time and also to lessen the pressure on the health infrastructure,” he said.

The civic body would offer free services at its care centres and would not regulate prices at the private COVID-19 Care Centres.

“It is the market that will decide. Besides, this is purely based on the choice of the individual. The GCC expects that the number of private care centres would be known only after the rollout happens,” Mr. Prakash said.

“A tie-up between hospitals and hotels is not necessary for getting a permit for a COVID-19 Care Centre. If the hotels have in-house medical teams, that’s enough,” he said.

Pointing to an increase in regulation by civic officials, Mr. Prakash said compliance with wearing masks had gone up in the past few days.

“The establishments that are having high footfalls are behaving with more discipline. Vaccination for all above 18 has been planned with specific target groups that have the potential to become super-spreaders,” he said.

GCC Joint Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese said the Corporation had decided to actively encourage private practitioners to refer symptomatic people for free testing at Corporation centres. “So, if you have symptoms, you can tell the fever survey worker, who will guide you to get tested. Walk-ins are also permitted. Residents are advised to go to a fever camp or urban primary health centre and get tested. Residents can go on their own to one of the centres of the Corporation,” he said.","Question paper will be for 50 marks; students can refer to textbooks

Anna University’s decision to change the pattern of examination has come as a surprise to students and some affiliated college faculty.

The university will conduct end-semester exams in the online mode for first, second and third year students. Final year students will take the multiple choice questions-type paper.

Under the new pattern, each question paper will be for 50 marks, lasting 90 minutes. Students must answer five 2-mark questions and five 8-mark questions, which will be analytical in nature, requiring them to be thorough with the subject. The university said students may refer to textbooks or resources on the web.

Teachers are awaiting more clarity though. They wonder how subjects such as Total Quality Management, Management Principles or Communication English would fit in the new pattern.

The new pattern has come in the middle of the semester when colleges have completed two of the three assessment exams.

New experience

A. Ramesh, principal of the Chennai Institute of Technology, said, “It will be a new experience for faculty as setting the question paper will require them to ensure answers are not easily accessible to the students,” he said.

Teachers are concerned about the lack of textbooks, particularly among students in rural and remote areas.

The college plans to make notes of lectures and send it in PDF form to students.

The principal of another affiliated college in a western district said the institution had arranged to courier the textbooks to students.

K.G. Parthibhan, principal of Aditya Institute of Technology, believes the change will augur well for students.

“Students should attend online classes and be attentive. In rural areas, students have taken up part time jobs. It will take time to bring them back to pre-COVID-19 times,” he said.

Not all are as enthusiastic, however. The principal of a college in Kancheepuram said in his college, around 85% of students were from rural areas and as many as 70% were first generation graduates.","Until last week, the Southern Railway, one of the popular public transport facilities in the city, had been going soft on commuters not following COVID-19 protocols.

Despite organising awareness programmes at important railway stations and making announcements on suburban trains on the need for wearing masks and maintaining physical distance, the Chennai Division of the Southern Railway found that a majority of commuters were not adhering to the rules.

As a result, the Southern Railway, based on the Railway Board’s recommendations, announced that a fine of ₹500 would be imposed on commuters not wearing masks.

The collection of penalty was effected from April 17 under the Indian Railway Rules (Penalties for activities affecting cleanliness at railway premises), under which a group of railway officials, including the Station Master/Manager, Railway Protection Force personnel and commercial staff, were empowered to enforce it.

A senior official of Southern Railway said that since the announcement on fines was made, more than ₹2.5 lakh had been collected from 500 passengers. More than ₹1.5 lakh was collected on Sunday alone.

Fines were collected from commuters who were found not wearing masks at railway stations and on trains (both express and suburban). The Southern Railway has also formed a special squad to inspect and penalise non-compliant commuters.

The official said the penalty drive was implemented only to educate and make the commuters aware of the importance of following COVID-19-appropriate behaviour on railway premises, and not with the intention of collecting fines as a source of income.","Despite the government announcing restrictions, commuters complain that some MTC buses are still crowded with many not wearing masks properly

Fear of contracting COVID-19 has made many opt for bikes and cars over public transport. However, for those forced to travel on Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses, the fear still remains. Many passengers feel that though there has been an improvement when it comes to wearing masks and ensuring physical distancing, stricter enforcement from the MTC is needed to ensure that sanitisers are provided in all buses and the vehicles are sanitised after each trip.

With COVID-19 cases increasing steadily in the State, the government reintroduced certain restrictions from April 10. As per the order, private and government buses plying between the districts and MTC buses running in Chennai should be operated only with seated passengers.

Each bus has the capacity to accommodate 44 seated passengers and 25 standing passengers. To enforce the restrictions, the MTC has rolled out 400 additional buses on busy routes. The passengers and the bus crew are expected to wear masks, and sanitisers are supposed to be provided in all buses.

“On Tuesday, I was travelling on [bus route] 23E. But only the driver was wearing a mask. Most buses do not have sanitisers. The number of standing passengers has reduced to some extent due to enforcement,” said M. Somasundaram, a consumer activist.

A bus conductor said the crew do not allow people to board the bus without a mask. “Some listen, but many argue. Sometimes, the traffic policemen enter the bus and fine those who do not wear masks or ensure distancing. However, we need sanitisers on the buses. We are at risk as we interact with thousands of passengers every day,” he said.

According to MTC officials, before the lockdown began, 34 lakh passengers used to travel on 3,300 MTC buses every day. However, after COVID-19 restrictions were imposed, the number of passengers dropped to 21 lakh, and now it is around 18 lakh. “It will drop even more due to the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns. But we are operating around 2,900 buses every day,” an official said.

He said some buses, especially those plying through industrial areas, were still crowded during peak hours. “This happens primarily when bunching of buses on the same route occurs. But since the number of passengers has dropped, the crowd has dwindled,” the official added.

Regarding sanitisers on buses, the officials claimed that they did not have the funds to procure them for each and every bus. “Initially, the Health Department provided us with sanitisers. Later, they asked us to procure it ourselves. We do not have the funds as we are already staring at huge losses. But we ensure that the buses are cleaned regularly,” an official said.

A senior MTC official said steps were being taken to vaccinate the staff at the earliest. “There are a total of 21,000 MTC staff and of them, 11,000 fall under the above 45 category. Vaccination is for their safety as they have to interact with many passengers every day,” the official said.

Autorickshaws and cabs

Besides, the government order also stated that rental taxis and cabs should operate with a maximum of three passengers, apart from the driver. Autorickshaws can carry a maximum of two passengers, apart from the driver.

“Regular autorickshaw drivers are following the government rules, taking public health into consideration. There are 1.1 lakh autorickshaws in the city. But the police and the government should tighten enforcement of share-autorickshaws,” said M. Sampath, general secretary, All Auto Driver Associations.

S. Ezhumalai, president of the Chennai and Suburban Share Autorickshaw Drivers’ Union (CSSADU), claimed that crowds had reduced. “People are frightened to travel in crowded vehicles. But no norms are followed in unauthorised vehicles that ply as share autorickshaws, especially in the suburbs,” he said.

P.R. Samy, general secretary, Tamilaga Call Taxi Matrum Anaithu Vaagana Otunar Sangam, said all the drivers were following the norms strictly.

“There is strict enforcement from the police. Our members, who drive for different app-based taxi aggregators, also inform the customers to wear masks and follow the rules,” he said.

K. Bhavaneeswari, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic, said the traffic police personnel were conducting awareness programmes on the importance of wearing masks and ensuring physical distance at traffic signals.

“We also ensure strict enforcement,” she said.","‘It will cause immense hardship to 3.5 crore daily wage workers’

The Tamil Nadu government should not consider imposing a full lockdown to combat the COVID-19 spread as it will cause immense hardship to more than 3.5 crore daily wage labourers, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said on Tuesday.

“Full lockdown will not be a solution for the rising number of COVID-19 cases. The Tamil Nadu government should give up such an idea. We saw last time itself that the daily wage workers, drivers, taxi drivers, lorry drivers, farm workers and others were the most affected. If the government implements a full lockdown, it cannot provide food to all of them all the time,” he said. Mr. Alagiri also announced that the party has set up a committee to help COVID-19 affected patients across the State find hospital beds and get medical treatment. The 24-hour helpline number is 98844 66333, he said. According to him, on Tuesday morning itself, the helpline number received a call and the party members coordinated a hospital bed for the person.

He also accused the Centre of laxity while condemning Health Minister Harsh Vardhan’s response to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.","Both boards are expected to announce a fresh schedule for the public exams only in June and students will have a gap of over six weeks now.

Following the postponement of both the CBSE and State Board Class 12 board exams, students will be looking to focus on preparing for entrance exams over the next few weeks. Both boards are expected to announce a fresh schedule for the public exams only in June and students will have a gap of over six weeks now.

The Tamil Nadu government had announced that all educational institutions and coaching classes should take their classes online from Tuesday and following this, several coaching centres which were preparing students for competitive exams have chalked out a schedule which include online tests, revision sessions and giving students access to video lessons.

“Our students have already started working with online worksheets and attending special classes with mentors. Over the next one month, they will continue preparing for their competitive exams, and this will also help them with their board examinations,” said Balaji Sampath, Founder, AhaGuru.

Mr Sampath said that while the additional time was a bonus for students to prepare better, he cautioned them against joining too many classes at this point. “It is best that they take up books and actively prepare by themselves. Students can use this time to make one page summaries or notes of each topic as they study, which they can go back to when they have to revise for the board exams,” he said.

Teachers across schools are also encouraging students to tackle topics that they had previously omitted, and are planning to conduct revision classes online where students can ask their doubts.

The April session of the JEE(Mains) were recently postponed owing to the increase in COVID-19 cases in the country. Many students who have already taken up the exam during the first and second session earlier this year were planning on taking up the exam again in April as well.

“For students who still have a lot of volume to cover with regard to preparing for entrance exams, we are working on guiding them in the right direction. It is important that they remain motivated and utilise the time available now in the right way,” said Pawan Kumar, Deputy Director, FIITJEE Chennai. Mr Pawan said that online proctored tests and revision sessions were being planned for the students.","A 50-year-old man, who was under treatment for COVID-19, ended his life within a private hospital’s premises in Kelambakkam, the police said.

Police identified the victim as Ranga, 57, who is a resident of Hasthinapuram, Chrompet. He was admitted in the hospital on April 16 since he had symptoms of COVID-19. He was depressed, since he was not able to meet any family member. He ended his life near the ward where he was undergoing treatment .

Personnel from the Kelambakkam police registered a case and handed over the body to his family after completing the post-mortem examination.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to constitute an expert body with persons having impeccable credentials to suggest ways and measures to prevent pollution of flowing water in rivers and waterbodies, either by way of discharge of effluents by industries or letting out of sewage by local inhabitants.

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy issued the directions while passing interim orders on a public interest litigation petition pending since 2017. Karur-based advocate T. Dhanasekaran had filed the case, accusing a private dyeing unit of polluting Amaravati river, a tributary of the Cauvery, by discharging effluents.

The petitioner’s counsel, V. Raghavachari, contended that the discharge of effluents into the river not just lead to pollution of surface water but also the groundwater, rendering them poisonous. He said river water in the entire region had become non-potable and urged the court to quash a 2014 government order granting permission for the expansion of the dyeing unit.

On the other hand, advocate Srinath Sridevan, representing the dyeing unit, said it was a zero-liquid discharge industry and the pollution of river water could not be attributed to it. There could be other reasons for pollution in the region.

After recording their submissions, the judges held that it was the duty of the State to ensure that pollution levels in flowing water is reduced to the lowest level. Appropriate checks and balances should be introduced to completely prohibit the discharge of effluents by industries as well as sewage by individuals, they said.

Impressing upon the need to preserve the quality of water in rivers for the benefit of users downstream, the judges agreed with Mr. Raghavachari that a polluted river would render the groundwater too toxic. A State which primarily depends upon flowing water and rainwater should take every endeavour to maintain their quality, they said.

After dictating the orders, the judges told State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan not to consider the case as an adversarial litigation and instead take positive steps towards preserving the natural resources for posterity. “It is not for you and me, it is for our children,” the Chief Justice said, stressing that the future generation should get to use fresh air and clean water.

The Chief Justice also expressed disappointment over the stench that continues to emanate from the Cooum, flowing through Chennai city. He said the foul smell could be felt even when the judges took a walk near the judges’ bungalows on Greenways Road, and even inside air-conditioned cars while they travelled across the Napier Bridge, every day, to reach the High Court.","ECI guidelines on physical distancing at counting centres may cause delays

The counting of the votes for the April 6 Assembly election is likely to take over 24 hours due to the latest directive of the Election Commission of India (ECI) to restrict the number of counting tables to one per 250 sq ft and other new procedures for completing the formalities for each round of counting.

The Virudhunagar administration had earlier planned to use 14 tables for each round in each counting hall, measuring 1,900 sq ft to 2,700 sq ft. It had also chosen new venues with bigger rooms to ensure adherence to the COVID-19 norms stipulated by the ECI, Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan told the candidates of various political parties and their representatives at a meeting held to discuss the counting procedure on Tuesday.

The ECI had stipulated that the size of the counting halls should be at least 2,000 sq ft to ensure distancing.

Following the outbreak of the second wave of COVID-19, the poll panel brought in the 250 sq ft norm for counting tables.

In the case of the Virudhunagar Assembly constituency, the officials had planned to use 14 tables for each round in the counting hall, measuring 2,225 sq ft. With 325 polling booths, it would have taken 24 rounds to complete the process. But with the new ECI norms, only eight tables are allowed in the hall.

Candidates divided

When the District Election Officer convened a meeting to get feedback from the candidates on having an additional counting hall for each of the seven Assembly constituencies in the district, there was no consensus among the candidates on the matter.

While the DMK’s representative agreed to have a second counting hall, other candidates opposed the idea, claiming it would create confusion. Some were apprehensive about having two counting halls for the same constituency in different buildings or on different floors.

“We will inform the ECI that no consensus was arrived at with regard to increasing the number of counting halls. We will follow the decision of the ECI on this issue,” Mr. Kannan said.

Verifying numbers

The official also explained to the candidates and the counting agents that after each round of counting, the general observer would have to verify the numbers in two counting units in each round.

Besides, only after the details are uploaded on the ENCORE (Enabling Communications on Real-time Environment) system of the ECI would each round be officially declared by the Returning Officers.

“Till such time, the next round of counting will not be taken up. Hence, each round will approximately take 40 minutes,” Mr. Kannan said.

An official said it would take at least 27-and-a-half hours to complete the EVM-based counting for 41 rounds in the Virudhunagar Assembly constituency. However, another official expressed the confidence that after the initial rounds, the process could be expedited. “If the ECI increases the number of tables or permits additional halls, the process could be completed much faster,” he added.

After the completion of the final round of counting on the control units, the officials will randomly pick five VVPATs in each Assembly constituency and manually count the printed votes and verify them with the EVM-based count. This process will take more time.","As many as 60,957 people were vaccinated against COVID-19 on Tuesday.

On a day when 3,711 sessions of both Covaxin and Covishield were held, a total of 2,879 healthcare workers, 5,983 frontline staff, 28,325 people in the 45-59 years age group and 23,770 people aged 60 and above were inoculated.

So far, 48,68,105 people have been immunised in the State.

Shortage of doses

Several residents complained of vaccine shortage in the last few days — a resident of Pattabhiram said when he went to get his second dose of the vaccine, he was told to go to another centre as the place where he went had no stock.

A resident of Chitlapakkam in Chennai said he and his family had taken Covishield at the Haridaspuram Health Centre on March 8. He had registered for the second dose on Wednesday. “I went there yesterday and was informed that they do not have the vaccine. They were unable to inform us about when they were likely to get stocks. They asked me to check vaccine availability daily,” he said.

Director of Public Health T. Selvavinayagam said, “We are sending 6 lakh doses to districts today.”","Vaccine wastage would be reduced from May 1, says Health Minister

Tamil Nadu on Tuesday received six lakh doses of Covishield. Health minister C. Vijayabaskar, who inspected the consignment, told reporters that the State was awaiting a consignment of five lakh doses of Covaxin.

Till date, the State has received 55,85,720 doses of vaccines and 48,07,148 doses have been administered.

Dr. Vijayabaskar said wastage of vaccines was inevitable as the State did not want to deny anyone who wanted a dose. Besides, awareness about vaccination was low and there were also rumours being floated about the vaccines, he said.

He said a person who may walk into a clinic in a rural centre could not be denied vaccination, fearing wastage. Wastage would reduce when more people were administered the same, he explained. From May 1, when everyone aged over 18 would be permitted to take the vaccines, wastage would automatically reduce, he said.

So far, 8,82,130 doses of Covaxin have been administered and the State has received one lakh additional doses. It is expecting another five lakh doses shortly, health officials said.

Till date, 41,21,783 people have received the first dose of Covishield and 6,85,365 people the second. As on date, the State has 1.45 lakh doses of Covaxin.

“We have a sufficient stock of vaccines, and 4,487 COVID-19 vaccine centres are functioning in the State. We got 1 lakh Covaxin doses two days ago and have distributed it to all centres. Today, we got six lakh Covishield vaccines. So far, the State has received 55,88,720 doses of vaccines and 48,07,148 have been fully administered,” Dr. Vijayabaskar said.

The State has a capacity to manufacture 400 tonnes of oxygen and a storage capacity for 1,200 tonnes, whereas the State’s medical facilities consume only around 240 tonnes, he said.","Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Tuesday said the Chief Secretary, as the head of the “caretaker government”, must take appropriate steps to bring the second wave of COVID-19 under control.

In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the Chief Secretary must take immediate steps to procure testing kits, oxygen cylinders and vaccines after the Union government removed its stranglehold on the State government.

“Any further delay will lead to more deaths. COVID-19 infections are expected to peak in May. It is important to vaccinate the majority. The shortage of vaccines is resulting in medical infrastructure in Tamil Nadu not being put to proper use,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said Tamil Nadu would need to procure three crore vaccines to inoculate those aged 45 and above, and this number would increase from May 1 as the Union government had allowed vaccines to be given to everyone aged 18 and above.

“Adequate vaccines should be procured and sent to the districts. A substantial number of people should be vaccinated before April 30. The Chief Secretary has a responsibility to act swiftly during a medical emergency,” he said.","Units manufacturing drugs and pharmaceuticals also included in the list

Night operations of IT/ITES companies, maintenance and operation of data centres and other critical IT infrastructure necessary to support back-end operations of medical, financial, transport and other critical services will be permitted in Tamil Nadu even during the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns, the State government said on Tuesday.

Telecommunication and related activities, warehousing functions, including loading, unloading and storage of goods, have also been permitted during the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns, a G.O. issued in this regard by Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan stated. “In the case of other industries that are not exempted, essential maintenance for purposes of fire, machine and worker safety shall be permitted on Sundays,” it said.

Units manufacturing drugs, pharmaceuticals, sanitation materials, oxygen, medical devices, medical textiles, their raw material components and their intermediates, food-related/food processing industries, including food for poultry, pets and animal husbandry and units engaged in the production of agricultural inputs including fertilisers, agricultural machinery and their components, could be considered “industries manufacturing essential commodities”, and hence, the night curfew and Sunday lockdowns would not apply to them, it stated.

All export units, those with export commitments or orders and their vendor units providing inputs to such industries, units that supply components/equipment for the defence sector, industries of automobiles and their components used in defence, agriculture and health sectors and those that produce packaging materials for all the above categories would also be considered “industries manufacturing essential commodities”.

As for units that can be considered “continuous process industries”, the government listed out the following: refineries, large steel plants (including TMT bar manufacturers), large cement plants, continuous process chemical industries, including paints, sugar mills, fertilisers, float glass plants, large foundries with a continuous process, tyre manufacturing plants, large paper mills, electronics industries using surface-mount technology, including mobile phones and consumer electronic products, automobile manufacturing units that have larger foundries, paint shops or other continuous processes and vertically integrated large textile units.

The government directed all industries to rigorously follow COVID-19 safety procedures such as adequate physical distancing on the shop floor and during transport and dining, use of masks, employee health monitoring, vaccination, necessary disinfection and sanitation measures. The Commissioner of the Greater Chennai Corporation and respective Collectors have been instructed to ensure compliance with the order.","They are equipped with paramedical staff and can accommodate over 4,500 people who require quarantine facilities

With infections surging in the State, the Southern Railway has kept 299 of its coaches, converted into isolation wards, ready on tracks across its network to accommodate over 4,500 people requiring quarantine facilities.

Though 573 coaches were modified during the first wave of COVID-19 last year, 274 were inducted back for passenger train operations.

Last March, the Ministry of Railways had approved the conversion of second-class coaches into isolation facilities, with oxygen and other basic medical infrastructure.

Workers needing stay

The Southern Railway has been witnessing a sharp increase in the number of migrant workers seeking accommodation in trains to travel back to their home States.

The zonal chief, in a note, appealed to the workers not to panic as a sufficient number of trains were being operated to several States from the southern destinations.

A total of 45 trains would be operated per week, on various days, from the 11 originating points in Tamil Nadu and Kerala to Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam and Jharkhand. These are considered key States from where migrant workers arrive to the southern region.

Care centres

With an increase in the demand for beds, the Tamil Nadu government has revived COVID-19 Care Centres in the State.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said 35,118 beds were made available so far, though only 5,784 people had got admitted. “We are appealing to asymptomatic people who test positive to move to COVID-19 Care Centres because beds in hospitals are required for patients with moderate or severe conditions,” he said.

Dr. Vijayabaskar said the flattening of the curve would not be possible without full-fledged public participation. Complacency remained an obstacle in achieving a reversal of the ongoing trend since a large number of people seemed “relaxed” when it came to wearing of masks.","Precautions to be taken in places of worship discussed

Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan chaired a series of meetings with representatives from various religious faiths, discussing steps to be taken in various places of worship to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Religious leaders and representatives from various faiths took part in the meeting held at the Secretariat on Tuesday.

‘No commitments yet’

A representative who took part in the meeting said representatives of various faiths put forward their opinions, but the State government had not committed to anything.

Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy, Tourism Secretary Vikram Kapur, Home Secretary S.K. Prabakar, Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, Public Secretary P. Senthil Kumar, Commissioner of Disaster Management D. Jagannathan and Chennai Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal were present.","Flyovers, bridges closed for traffic; check-points set up on arterial roads in city

All tourist spots, including the Nilgiris, Kodaikanal and Yercaud hill stations, were closed on Tuesday as restrictions to contain the second wave of COVID-19 came into force in Tamil Nadu.

The authorities also began enforcing a night curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation released fresh timetables for long-distance bus services and suspended night-time operations. The Salem Division of the Southern Railway also announced the cancellation of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway services until further orders.

In the Nilgiris, boatmen staged a protest to highlight their concerns over the loss of livelihood.

In Chennai, most arterial roads, flyovers and streets wore a deserted look following the implementation of night curfew. The entire city is under the surveillance of the police.

Police in the city said 38 flyovers and 75 bridges were closed during the night.

Check-points were set up on arterial roads, such as Anna Salai, Poonamallee High Road, Kamarajar Salai and Sardar Patel Road, among others. Smaller roads leading to major ones were also sealed.

Chennai Police Commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal said, “Intensive vehicle checks are being conducted in 200 places on arterial roads. Over 2,000 men have been deployed to implement the curfew effectively from 10 p.m., as per the guidelines of the government. The message on night curfew has reached the people. We have started checking the movement of vehicles.”

As Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has been promulgated, action will be taken against violators and cases will be booked against them under relevant provisions of the law, he said.

Vehicles of those loitering without any purpose would be seized, the Commissioner warned.

In addition to night-round officers, personnel will be deployed to enforce other COVID-19 restrictions effectively, he said.","Active cases touch 79,804; Chennai logs 3,711 more infections; 48 persons die due to COVID-19

The Madukkarai police arrested the woman and her friend who together buried the body after the murder.

The police said Nagaraj from Chandirapuram in Negamam had been residing on Muniyappan Kovil Street near Madukkarai market along with his second wife Amutha.

The couple joined a kolamavu manufacturing unit at Madukkarai six days ago. Amutha got acquainted with S. Sankar (32) from Thoothukudi, who had been doing welding works at the unit, and the friendship grew into an affair.

“Nagaraj, who was under the influence of alcohol, came to know on Monday midnight that Sankar and Amutha were together at the workplace. When he went there and tried to strangle Amutha, Sankar bludgeoned him with a hammer,” said a police officer. Sankar and Amutha later buried the body near the workplace.

On Tuesday, the police got specific information that a body was buried near the unit.

Body exhumed

Nagaraj’s body was exhumed in the presence of a tahsildar and Perur DSP R. Srinivasulu. The police arrested Sankar and Amutha after they confessed to the crime on Tuesday.","The Coimbatore City and District (Rural) Police together deployed around 900 personnel for special checks and patrols to enforce the night curfew that came into effect at 10 p.m. on Tuesday. The police force across Coimbatore city and rural was asked to maintain composure while dealing with people, including motorists, during the curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

In Coimbatore city, around 400 police personnel were deployed, and City Police Commissioner S. Davidson Devasirvatham instructed them to enforce the curfew in a polite manner. Personnel on curfew duty were also advised to use body-worn cameras depending on the availability.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law & Order) G. Stalin said vehicle checks were done at 11 permanent check-posts and 22 temporary check-posts. Fifteen vehicle patrols and 44 two-wheeler patrols were also deployed.

Gandhipuram town, mofussil and SETC bus stands, New Bus Stand on Mettupalayam Road and the bus stands at Ukkadam and Singanallur wore a deserted look at 10 p.m. A few persons who claimed they did not know of the night curfew got stranded at the bus stands. The city police arranged autorickshaws at Coimbatore and Podanur railway stations for passengers who got stranded after arriving on different trains during the curfew hours.

While hotels and shops remained closed, several bakeries were found open after 10 p.m. in the city. The police downed their shutters. Private vehicles continued to ply on Avinashi Road, Tiruchi Road, Sathyamangalam Road, Pollachi Road, Palakkad Road and Thadagam Road after 10 p.m. before the police tightened vehicle checks at check-posts along the city-rural border.

In Coimbatore rural limits, around 500 police personnel were deployed. A senior official said two-wheeler and four-wheeler patrols were carried out to check movement of people and vehicles.

Tiruppur

In Tiruppur, the city police set up 26 additional check points in the city limits to monitor vehicle movement. Police sources said 10 patrol vehicles, each with a Sub-Inspector and four police constables, along with 25 two-wheeler police vehicles were on the rounds.

The 10 existing vehicle check-posts in the city, including those on Palladam Road, Tiruppur-Avinashi Road, Dharapuram Road and Perumanallur Road, were strengthened with additional personnel, the sources said.

Even before the night curfew came into force, the vehicle movement in many parts of Tiruppur thinned out and shops and other establishments downed shutters in advance.","They include 8 samples from Thanjavur school cluster

A total of 14 samples that were lifted from community clusters that surfaced in some parts of the State and were sent for whole genome sequencing (WGS), have returned positive for the U.K. variant of COVID-19.

According to official data, eight samples from the Thanjavur school cluster (two each from schools in Ammapettai, Kulichapatti and Thiruvisainallur, and one each from schools in Thalavapalayam and Puthur); two samples from the Commercial Tax Staff Training Institute, Nandanam; two from the Omandurar Medical College; and two from the IT cluster - AGS Health Pvt Limited, Kandanchavadi and Taramani, were referred to InSTEM, Bengaluru for WGS. The 14 samples returned positive for the U.K. variant.

Earlier, public health officials decided to send randomly selected samples from clusters for WGS.

A total of 69 COVID-19 samples from community clusters were referred for WGS. The results of 14 samples were received, while those of 55 others are pending.

All 14 cluster samples were tested at the State Public Health Laboratory, and it was found that the S-gene (spike protein) was missing in them.

Further analysis

“This finding needs further analysis. We need to work with academic institutions like the Indian Council of Medical Research,” T.S. Selvavinayagam, Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said.

The State has so far referred 127 RT-PCR-positive samples to InSTEM, Bengaluru, and the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for WGS. These were samples lifted from U.K. travellers and their contacts, and community clusters.

Of these, the State has received the results of 62 samples, while those of 65 others are awaited.

A total of 29 samples — 15 from U.K. travellers and their contacts and 14 from community clusters — returned positive for the U.K. variant. Another 25 samples returned negative for the variant, while the results of eight samples were inconclusive, according to the data.

“Since control measures, including treatment, remain the same, there is no need to panic. Wear masks, maintain physical distance and take the vaccine as per eligibility,” Dr. Selvavinayagam said.","Coimbatore district on Tuesday reported 686 new cases of COVID-19, registering a slight decline in the daily caseload that stood above the 700-mark for two consecutive days on Sunday and Monday.

According to the Health Department, 4,842 COVID-19 patients from Coimbatore district were under institutional care and 559 persons were discharged on Tuesday. The total number of positive cases reported in Coimbatore district stood at 68,835.

Tiruppur district reported 216 new cases, taking the overall tally to 22,279. The caseload on Tuesday was lower to that of Monday and Sunday, when 296 and 307 cases were reported respectively.

According to sources in the Health Department, the 16 men aged between 19 and 27 tested positive on April 6 and were admitted to the Tiruppur Government Medical College Hospital.

Upon their discharge after a week, the workers were asked to quarantine themselves for one more week till Tuesday.

However, the mill authorities allegedly allowed the 16 migrant workers to be a part of a batch of 40 workers who left for Jharkhand in a bus on Monday, the sources said.

While Health Department authorities launched efforts to trace them, the migrant workers were unlikely to spread the virus as the infectivity of most of the COVID-19 patients would come down by the 12th day, the sources said.

Officials in Jharkhand would be alerted about their arrival, the sources added.","Will ramp up testing and monitoring of quarantine areas

The Coimbatore Corporation shut the VOC Park, Gandhi Park and other parks in the city, in keeping with the State Government’s recent restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19, according to a release from the civic body.

The Corporation’s bus stands would remain closed from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., owing to the night curfew. Ambulance and other vehicles of the healthcare sector would be allowed to operate during this time.

During the total lockdown on Sundays, meat stalls, fish markets, vegetable shops, malls, cinemas, and shopping complexes would not be allowed to function. Restaurants and other eateries can function from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m., noon to 3 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. to provide only parcel service.

As per the Government’s directive, the Corporation would allow food delivery companies to function.

Only 100 persons would be allowed at weddings and 50 at funerals on all days, and the Corporation’s field officers would monitor such events to check for violations.

Officials would monitor quarantined areas and try to intensify testing to identify COVID-19 positive persons. Assistant Commissioners and Sanitary Officers have been asked to rope in students of laboratory technology and nursing to increase the collection of samples.

The release also said that Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian had asked the City Health Officer to resume mobile units for collection of samples, increase testing and check on people who were in home quarantine.

The Corporation was also conducting fever clinics, the release said, adding that there would be a minimum of 20 clinics in each of the five zones.","From Wednesday, wholesale onion traders would function from Eru Company, Commissioner P. Kumaravel Pandian said on Tuesday after inspecting the MGR Wholesale Market and a few other places.

Officials, who accompanied him, said the shifting was to decongest the MGR market to ensure traders and visitors adhered to COVID-19 safety protocol.

The Corporation considered the possibility of moving them to the Mettupalayam Road bus stand, as it had done in 2020 when the lockdown was in effect, but decided against it because the bus stand was in use.

The Corporation chose Eru Company because wholesale tomato traders from the Market continued to use a portion of the bus stand. Asking the onion traders to move to the bus stand would decongest the Market, and lead to overcrowding in the bus stand.

The officials said the Corporation would provide toilet facility and water connection to the traders, who would have to erect temporary shelters to store goods and conduct business.

MGR Wholesale Market trader A. Subramani said around 30 traders dealt with onion. Though they were only one-third of the total trader strength, the volume of onion they traded overshadowed other vegetables. The market saw 600 tonnes onion exchange hands.","With more than 10,000 cases being reported on a daily basis, the state government had recently announced fresh restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.

During his address to the nation Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had urged states to find jobs for migrant labourers so as to stop them from heading back to their native places even as he sought to assure them that they will get their vaccine shots wherever they are and the prevailing pandemic situation won’t affect their livelihoods.

However, despite the PM’s words of assurance, thousands of workers have been queuing up at the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr MGR Central Railway Station in Chennai since Tuesday to take the train back home. Tamil Nadu is home to more than 10 lakh migrant workers, with the majority hailing from northern and north-eastern states. In March last year, after the nationwide lockdown took effect, most of these workers were left stranded at the Central station without trains. They suffered without food and water. The trauma of last year’s lockdown is still fresh in their minds and the workers say they don’t want to face a similar situation this time.

With more than 10,000 cases being reported on a daily basis, the state government had recently announced fresh restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. A night curfew announced by the government has been in force since April 20. On Sundays, there is complete lockdown with only essential services allowed to function and vehicles ferrying essential goods allowed to ply.

“Government should help us by permitting more special trains. I have been sleeping near the station for the past two days. The police are not allowing us to sleep inside the station. So, we have to find some place nearby to sleep at night. I only have money to buy a ticket and am just about managing with the food I packed before I reached here. My wife and kid are alone, I want to go home as soon as possible,” said Subash, a resident of Odisha.

Long queues were seen in front of the reservation counter as there are no unreserved compartments. Many passengers were seen queueing up at the counter, waiting to travel to West Bengal, Patna, Uttar Pradesh and Chattisgarh, among other native places. The Southern Railway (SR) had announced that it would be running special trains or adding additional coaches to existing ones to clear the rush of the migrant workers. They have asked workers not to panic, assuring that regular trains will be operated to their native states. As per the latest information provided by SR, a total of 17 trains will be operated from Chennai Central in a week. These include three trains to Bihar, 10 to West Bengal and two trains apiece to Odisha and Uttar Pradesh. Another for Assam is scheduled to leave from Tambaram.

A senior railway official said unnecessary panic is causing migrant workers to queue up at the railway station. “They fear a complete lockdown despite several announcements from the government. Some of them reach the station a day before their journey for fear that they may not be able to move out of their areas due to the prevailing curfew. The railway police are making sure the passengers wear masks and maintain social distancing. The passengers are regularly informed about Covid safety measures through loudspeakers,” he said.","A 33-year-old woman, who lost her children and father in a fire accident recently, allegedly died by suicide by jumping before a train in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district.

The deceased has been identified as Vidhya, 33. After she went missing, her mother informed the neighbours and upon searching the area, they found her body on a railway track. Jolapettai Railway Police reached the spot and sent her body to a government hospital for postmortem.

As per the local reports, Vidhya is separated from her husband and had been living in her father’s house.

Her actions were allegedly prompted by an accident where she lost her father, Mohan Reddy (55), and two children, Thejas (8) and Dhanush (6). The incident took place on Sunday, April 18, at a firecracker shop located near the Latheri bus stop which was owned by Vidhya’s father. The shop caught fire when one potential buyer asked the shop owner to demonstrate one of the crackers before purchasing.

Fire service personnel from Katpadi and Gudiyatham stations reached the spot to doze off the flames. However, the shop owner and children died in the accident. Their bodies were sent to the government hospital in Adukkamparai for postmortem. Three flower shops and more than 10 two-wheelers parked near the shop were completely destroyed in the accident.

District collector A Shanmuga Sundaram and Superintendent of Police S Selvakumar visited the spot and conducted further inquiries.

Addressing the reporters on Sunday, the district collector had said the administration will take the necessary steps to provide financial aid to the family of the deceased. He said a set of guidelines have been issued to the revenue, police, and fire department personnel. The firecracker shops have been requested to immediately dispose of the crackers which may cause heavy damage.

He further said that children and other non-related personnel should not be allowed inside the firecracker shop. The officials have been asked to do sudden inspections of the firecracker stores in the district to check whether the shop owners are following all the safety guidelines issued by the government, he said.

CHENNAI: A 57-year-old patient, who was being treated for Covid-19, was found hanging at a private hospital in Kelambakkam on Monday night.

Police said Rangan from Hasthinapuram in Chrompet was undergoing treatment at the hospitalâs corona Ward since April 16.

On Monday, he asked the hospital staff to allow him to see his wife and daughters.

However, they refused, citing that they could contract the virus. Rangan was asked to wait for a couple of days to meet his family members. Since then, Rangan was allegedly upset over not being allowed to meet his family. He is said to not mingle with medical staff at the ward, properly for the past two days.

","Sterlite premises in Tuticorin

CHENNAI: Metals major Vedanta Limited on Tuesday offered to support the Centre and various states, including Tamil Nadu , in their fight against Covid-19, by supplying around 1,000 tonnes per day (tpd) or 920 kilolitres of oxygen from its Sterlite Copper premises in Tuticorin .

The copper smelter facility has remained shut for more than three years, following protests by locals, alleging pollution. On May 22, 2018, police opened fire as protests turned violent resulting in the death of 13 people. While the plant had been shut for maintenance since March 23, 2018, the state government ordered its permanent closure and sealed the campus on May 28, 2018.

There are two oxygen plants, which can be operated independently, and supply around 1,000 tpd of oxygen to various state governments to meet the rising demand.

Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Sunday, after reviewing the Covid situation in the state and ordering fresh restrictions, directed the industries department to give temporary licenses to industrial units, which are willing to supply oxygen during the critical time.

Sterlite Copper, part of the Vedanta group, reached out to Union health and family welfare minister Harsh Vardhan and the TN CM through separate letters, offering to help. The company has also filed a petition outlining this offer of support in the Supreme Court, in view of the ongoing legal proceedings.

âThe Sterlite Copper plant in Tuticorin contains two oxygen plants, with a combined capacity of producing 1,000 tonnes of oxygen daily. We would like to now offer these facilities for your use, towards ensuring that there is no lack of this vital commodity in the nation, and also to join hands with the commendable efforts of our PM at this critical juncture,â Pankaj Kumar, CEO, Sterlite Copper said in his letter to the Union health minister.

âWe would be grateful to be allowed this opportunity to support the nationâs needs. Our staff stand prepared to get these two plants operational in the shortest possible time and begin dispatching oxygen to the critical areas as per your direction,â he said in the letter.

In a separate letter to CM Palaniswami, Kumar said Covid cases were increasing at a rapid rate in Tamil Nadu and other states. Most state governments have been facing a shortage of oxygen supply to treat the increasing number of Covid patients.

âThe oxygen plant is presently lying shut owing to the orders passed by the TNPCB and the state government shutting down the Copper Smelter unit of the company. This is a humble request to grant us the necessary permission and allow us to run the oxygen plant, which will be instrumental in supporting the state governments in these critical times,â he said in his letter to Palaniswami.

CHENNAI: Members of the Tamil Nadu Theatre Owners Association on Tuesday decided to continue to operate the theatres, despite the state imposing night curfew and Sunday full curfew from this week.

As theatres will not function on April 25 when the first Sunday curfew comes into force, the members have decided to curtail the number of shows on other days to three from the present four due to the night curfew.

âWe have decided to keep the theatres running despite the night curfew and Sunday curfew affecting our trade. If we have to discuss any of our issues now, it has to be done only with the officials. We will rather wait for a new elected government to take over and then approach it with our problems and work towards a lasting solution. Till that time, theatres will manage their shows with the films already released,â leading exhibitor and distributor Tirupur K Subramanian said.

With polling for the Tamil Nadu assembly election having already taken place on April 6, the polled votes will be counted on May 2.

The first victim of the fresh curbs is âMGR Maganâ featuring actors Sasikumar and Satyaraj. The film, which was scheduled to be released this Friday, has now been postponed due to proposed curfew. Actor Sivakarthikeyanâs âDoctorâ, which was tentatively planned to have a May 13 theatrical release, is also likely to be postponed further, industry sources said.

âDue to the new set of restrictions, producers will not come forward to release films. Other than the opening weekend of a filmâs release, where the collections peak on the first three days, normally the maximum collections for a running film comes on Sundays. This will definitely affect the industry,â K Meenakshi Sundaram, vice president, Mayajaal Multiplex, said.

CHENNAI/TRICHY: Long-distance government buses began leaving the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus in Koyambedu from 4.30am on Tuesday, when the new restrictions kicked in, to ensure they reached their destinations before night curfew came into effect at 10pm.

The last bus to southern districts of Tirunelveli, Nagercoil or Tuticorin left before 8am, while there was not a single State Express Transport Corporation (SETC) bus to Coimbatore after 10.30am. Against the 300 SETC buses that are operated from Chennai, just160 left CMBT on Tuesday, according to official data.

Passenger footfalls dropped sharply, with barely 15-20 seats occupied in every bus. Rajesh, a SETC conductor, said, âBesides the fear of Covid-19, excess heat is also a factor which deters many passengers from taking morning buses to faraway places.â

The situation was no different in districts like Trichy, Madurai or Salem, with several buses taken back to depots as there were not enough passengers.

Amid this, contradictory statements about operation of private buses belonging to two major associations left passengers confused. While one claimed services have been put on hold, the other claimed around 400 buses were operated.

Mohammed Afzal, president of Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners Association , said 20% of the 2,500 private buses in the state will continue be made available for public in the morning hours following government guidelines.

Ticket fares were halved for A/C buses, but there were not many takers. R Balakrishnan, a bus operator from Trichy, said that passengers were scared about what would happen if the buses reached late and they were stuck at the bus stand without transport to their houses. âAlso, not many are keen on sacrificing one full day of their leave/holidays on travel,â he said.

The state government is yet to respond to bus operators' request to allow limited services at night. As a result, demand for morning trains shot up. Non A/C seats and sleeper class tickets got filled for travelling between Chennai and Trichy, Madurai and Coimbatore. Almost 60% of A/C seats on trains for commute in the coming days were also filled.

CHENNAI: Following the announcement of the open book test for students of four campuses of Anna University , the university on Monday announced that students in constituent colleges, regional campuses, and affiliated colleges will also write their semester exams as an open book, online-proctored test in May.

âDuring the exam, students can refer to course materialin physical form as well as from the web. However, getting answers from others in any way or form and group discussions will be considered as malpractice,â a circular to affiliated colleges from the centre for academic courses, Anna University, said.

All questions will be analytical with no direct answers from the textbooks or reference books. Students need to write the exam on paper and upload the answer sheets after the exams. For final year students, the exams will be conducted online with multiple choice-based questions.

Anna Universityâs former vice-chancellor E Balagurusamy said open book test is a very good concept and popular method of examination. âOpen book tests need to be conducted in a controlled environment and students should complete the test within a specific period of time. With analytical questions, one cannot copy the answer from the book. Only intelligent ones can shine in open book tests as one needs to know where exactly they should look for answers in the book,â he said. He, however, said conducting open book tests across the state would be a challenge as the internet connection speed may not fast everywhere.

V E Annamalai, principal of SSN College of Engineering in Chennai, said students need to understand the concepts and have to apply the knowledge in the tests. âDespite having books, students may not be able to answer the questions. Conventional exams test the knowledge of the students, whereas open book tests will test their understanding and application,â he said.

B Chidambararajan, principal of SRM Valliammai Engineering College said the open book test would be a huge shift for students from MCQs-based exams. âThe pass percentage may drop. These students have traditionally prepared for memory-based exams. If the university asks analytical questions, a majority of them will struggle even to identify the units from which the question is asked,â he said.

Deemed universities such as Sastra have been conducting open book tests. âWe can get creative while framing questions. There wonât be one correct answer and it will test the studentsâ creativity and conceptual understanding,â said S Vaidyasubramaniam, vice-chancellor of SASTRA.

Colleges such as Loyola had the open-book test for the first internal assessment but are switching back to proctored online tests for semester exams based on feedback from parents. âParents feel conventional exams are the best way to test students. We have to train our faculty to set questions for open-book exams and create awareness among the parent, as it will equip students to develop the problem-solving ability and applying concepts,â said Thomas Amirtham, principal of Loyola College .

Arjun had come close to becoming a Grandmaster in the previous tournament last week, but the nerves got the better of him. âI needed a win in the penultimate round of the event. Despite being in a good position --- I made a mistake and went on to lose that game. I thought becoming a Grandmaster will take more time. Thankfully, I did well in this event to get the monkey off my back,â Arjun told TOI.

Interestingly, the 2500 ELO mark had eluded Arjun for a long time. âIn June 2019, I was playing an event in Italy and needed 3-4 points to cross the 2500 barrier. But I failed to do so. This time things were a little shaky but I am happy to have pulled it off,â said Arjun, who has five GM norms. He left for Serbia on April 1 to be part of three back-to-back over-the-board events. âWinning my first over-the-board event in the last 12 months boosted my confidence. I finished joint first in the second event and this tournament too has gone as per plan,â said Arjun, who learned the nuances of the sport from AL Kasi at the T Nagar chess academy. He is also coached by IM Saravanan and Ukrainian GM Aleksandr Goloshchapov.

In a bid to manage both studies and chess, Arjun took a break from the sport in January last year. During the board exams, Arjun suffered an eye injury while playing badminton. âI injured my left eye and had to undergo a surgery as well. But I was happy to have not missed out on the exams,â said Arjun, who wrote the papers with vision only in his right eye and scored 95%. He is pursuing his bachelorsâ course from SRM College .

The Covid-19 pandemic left Arjun without any tournaments for over a year. But he got a chance to be part of overthe-board events during this trip to Serbia. âWinning my first over-the-board event in the last 12 months boosted my confidence. I finished joint first in the second event and this tournament too has gone as per plan,â said Arjun.

State health minister C Vijayabaskar told TOI on Tuesday that the Centre has taken the decision âwithout consulting the stateâ and the move has affected the stateâs plan to ensure seamless supply of the lifesaving gas.

âWe are ready to help all our neighbours. We did so even during the peak of 2020 crisis. But the Centre should have taken the ground reality into account. We will be taking up this issue with the Union health minister soon,â he said. On April 18, National Health Mission joint director Nipun Vinayak wrote to 15 states about the revised supply plan for oxygen after a review meet of the empowered group on oxygen supply. Reallocation was made for Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan superseding the allocations made on April 15.

âAccording to earlier allocation by the Centre, Tamil Naduâs supply would have increased from 200 metric tonnes on April 20 to 320 metric tonnes by April 25, and to 465 tonnes by end of April. But as per the revised order, AP and Telangana were allotted 360 metric tonnes of oxygen, while TNâs allotment is still at 200 metric tonnes,â Vijayabaskar said.

âAccording to earlier allocation by the Centre, Tamil Naduâs supply would have increased to 320 metric tonnes by April 25 and to 465 tonnes by the month-end. But, as per the revised order, each of these states has got 360 metric tonnes of oxygen compared to 200 tonnes for Tamil Nadu,â Vijayabaskar said. The Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation, he said, has increased oxygen storage capacity by nearly three times at government hospitals.

On Tuesday, state health officials also told health ministry during a video call that the only buffer at the worst-affected district, Chennai, was now being taken away. They also argued that Andhra Pradesh had the Vizag steel plant from where the state couold draw supplies.

Last year, at the peak on July 31, Tamil Nadu had 57,968 active cases. For about two to three days around that time, the oxygen requirement jumped to 280 metric tonnes. âIf we assume that active cases double compared to last year, the estimate for oxygen requirement, after including problems of delay in treatment, will go up to around 500 metric tonnes,â a senior official said.

CHENNAI: With 10,986 new cases, 75% of beds in government facilities in Chennai were occupied as on Tuesday. While TN had 79,808 active cases, Chennai had 28,005 such cases, including 3,711 fresh ones. The stateâs total case tally was 10.13 lakh (10,13,378) and toll 13,205.

By 3pm, the control room at the directorate of medical education that manages patient flow in state-run hospitals and covid care centres reported that just 25% beds were available at the five Covid facilities in the city four government medical college hospitals and government covid hospital in Guindy which together have 4,368 beds. Totally, there were 3,269 Covid patients at these facilities. âWe direct patients with more than 50% lung involvement to medical college hospitals. Most of these patients require tertiary care with oxygen support,â said director of medical education Dr R Narayanababu.

Patients with less than 50% lung involvement requiring intermittent oxygen support are sent to health care centres, he said. Of the 1,800 beds in 11 such centres across the city, 648 (36%) were occupied. Patients with mild symptoms are advised home isolation or sent to Covid care centres. On Tuesday, of the 11,645 beds in 14 covid care centres, 5,559 were occupied. Among the 114 private hospitals in Chennai providing Covid Care, 108 of them had updated their status on the state webpage(https://stopcorona.tn.gov.in/). Of these, 32 hospitals had 100% occupancy or more.

","Chennai: How do we build an Asian movement for ending live animal markets and wildlife trade? This is a key question amid the raging second wave. Itâs also one of the topics of discussion at the Asia for Animals (AfA) Conference 2021, which will be held on April 24 and 25. People across the world can now attend the event as it is going virtual for the first time.

âWe will be talking about the meat markets in Asia and what we are going to do to deal with them as they are the breeding ground for many diseases and also one of these places from which Covid-19 emerged,â says Varda Mehrotra, executive director, Federation Of Indian Animal Protection Organizations (FIAPO), which along with the Blue Cross of India, and the AfA Coalition, is organising the conference. âWe are also going to explore how organisations, and individuals interested in the movement can organise themselves and carry on our work in the post-Covid world, working with remote teams and adapting to the changing reality. The final session will focus on the future of the movement.â

The biennial conference, which has been hosted in various countries across Asia will feature 45 speakers from across the world, including English primatologist and anthropologist Jane Goodall. âThe aim is to share knowledge and discuss policies in Asia, brainstorm how to improve networking between animal welfare organisations across Asia, discuss best practices, and get all animal welfare organisations together to improve the lives of animals across Asia,â says Sathya Radhakrishnan, honorary joint secretary, Blue Cross of India.

AfA 2021 will have presentations, panel discussions and breakways, all of which will be followed by Q&A sessions aimed at encouraging food-for-thought, discussing challenges and deriving customized solutions.

The highlights include sessions that explore the challenges organisations and activists face while combating the cat and dog meat trade, and how organisations can help tourist operators (elephant camps, circuses, animals used in selfie tourism etc) move away from animal tourism to alternative models.

âInterested people can register online and attend the conference. People from Asian countries need to pay only $10,â says Radhakrishnan, adding that student discounts are also available.

"Solar rooftop solutions provider Freyr Energy on Wednesday said it has raised ₹ 18 crore from Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia and C4D Partners.

The funds will be used to accelerate growth and further enhance customer experience, a release on the equity investment said. Managing Director Saurabh Marda sought to highlight how the company stood to gain from the capital as well as global experience in the energy sector of the investors. For C4D Partners, the Netherlands-based Impact Investment Fund, this is a follow-on investment. It had led the Series A funding round in the firm in November 2018. Freyr Energy had then raised ₹ 27 crore through a mix of equity and debt.

Investors in the latest round were buoyant about the growth prospects from the SunPro+ customer app Freyr had launched a few months ago towards making the process of owning a solar system simple and seamless for customers.

Florian Temime, principal, Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, said the “innovative software will ease the acquisition of rooftop solar customers and facilitate the​ entire customer journey from acquisition to after sales service. Gilles Vermot Desroches, president of SEEA Asia said with the app Freyr Energy can contribute to mass-market adoption of solar energy.","State records 6,542 COVID-positive cases and 20 deaths on Tuesday

COVID-19 cases and deaths continued to increase at an alarming rate in Telangana. On Tuesday, 20 COVID-19 patients died and 6,542 were detected with the virus. Day after day, a new highest number of cases and deaths is being recorded. The highest number of deaths in a day last year was 14.

However, doctors in government and private hospitals have been claiming that the deaths are more than what is being mentioned in daily media bulletins. The rate at which number of people with coronavirus is increasing in the State can be understood when data from beginning of the second wave is considered. The cases started to increase again from March 9. From 395 cases on March 20 — a month ago — the daily cases increased to 6,542 on April 20.

Of the 6,542, the highest of 898 were from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), 570 from Medchal-Malkajgiri, 532 from Rangareddy. The lowest of 42 were from Mulugu. From March 2, 2020 to April 20 of this year, a total of 1,20,73,090 samples were put to test and 3,67,901 were detected with the virus. Of the total, 46,488 were active cases, 3,19,537 have recovered and 1,876 have died.","CCMB and Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) are among the 10 labs chosen by the Centre for genome sequencing of the COVID-19 samples

It has been three months since the formation of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG). It is comprised of top 10 regional labs of CSIR, DBT and ICMR and is involved in genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. However, they are yet to get sufficient number of samples from the COVID-19 positive patients from both government and private healthcare centres.

“In the last few months the funds have come by and necessary reagent purchases have been made and coordination among the labs too is improving. However, we are not getting the required number of samples. It is about 50-60 samples a day when we can do genome sequence up to 1,000 samples. Efforts are being made for samples to be received by the sequencing labs to attain the best possible outcome,” discloses CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) Director Rakesh Mishra on Tuesday.

CCMB and Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) are among the 10 labs chosen by the Centre for genome sequencing of the COVID-19 samples. ""We are supposed to get 5% of the new positive samples collected from various districts, mandals and even villages from across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, parts of Karnataka and Goa. But, we have been receiving samples from limited geographical locations. Whereas, the supply from the remote places is non-existent. It is also because the government’s health machinery has once again been stretched to the limit due to the second wave,"" he points out.

States like Karnataka and Goa seem to have preferred sending their COVID-19 samples to the local labs. “Here, we need the Governments and local bodies help to secure more samples from those testing positive. We also need samples from private hospitals where people are getting admitted for effective and continuous monitoring,"" says Dr. Mishra.

The consortium had so far genome sequenced upto 14,000 samples across the country finding “large number of variants of which 2,000 variants fall into the 'concerned' category”. “The very nature of the virus is to mutate and check into nearby hosts - we have to continuously keep monitoring the variants to look for any potent strains which may make the available vaccines redundant or cause more rapid transmission. For that we need to enhance our sample collection and also sequencing numbers,"" he affirms.

The exercise is to ensure not a single obscure variant is missed by the scientists. And, if one such dangerous variant is sighted, the particular area can be quarantined to keep it under check. ""We are currently studying the double mutation variant and results should be out soon. Genome sequencing of the COVID-19 samples will also establish whether the spike is due to superspreader events. It will also look for high mortality, morbidity trends and co-relate with the associated symptoms. Reinfections too can be effectively monitored through this process”, says the Director.

Other labs involved in genome sequencing are NIBMG Kalyani, ILS Bhubaneswar, ICMR-NIV Pune, NCCS Pune, InStem/NCBS Bengaluru, NIMHANS Bengaluru, CSIR-IGIB Delhi, and NCDC Delhi. Dr. Mishra had already stated that double mutation or 'B.1.617' is largely prevalent in Maharastra (upto 50%) and UK variant in Punjab (upto 50%). These are found to be 5%-10% prevalent in other places and it could mean the current spike is likely due to the commonly prevalent virus strains and due to lack of covid appropriate behaviour.","IMD forecasts light to moderate rain across State in coming days

HYDERABAD: The suspense is continuing among the Congress candidates over who will get the 'B-form' to contest the municipal polls on the party ticket.

A large number of candidates have filed nominations from various wards in seven urban local bodies and nine wards in other civic bodies, expecting B-form.

Telangana Congress leadership has decided to give B-forms directly to the election authorities on Thursday (April 22), the last date for withdrawal of nominations.

Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the partyâs election committees will finalise the candidates and give B-forms directly to the election officials.

Reddy appealed to all the remaining candidates from the party to withdraw from the electoral fray and work for the victory of candidates finalised by the party.

The party will recognise their services and reward them suitably at an appropriate time, he said.

But the task of ensuring withdrawal of party candidates is easier said than done and the threat of them remaining in the fray as rebels is looming large.

The TRS, BJP and Congress, all three main parties are staring at rebels' threat with a large number of candidates from these parties having filed their nominations expecting a B-form.

As many as 247 nominations were filed by Congress candidates for 66 wards in Greater Warangal Municipal Corporation.

Even in Khammam urban local body, as many as 125 nominations were filed by the Congress leaders. There are only 60 wards in the civic body, which are going to polls on April 30.

The situation is no different in Siddipet, Atchampet, Nakrekal, Jadcherla and Kothur civic bodies going to polls on April 30.

","HYDERABAD: The Telangana government is yet to respond to the State Election Commission 's letter whether to go ahead with the municipal elections or not.Election Commission officials said they will continue to make arrangements for conduct of polls on April 30 until they get a written reply from the government.They appealed to all the concerned not to believe in rumours that elections have been postponed.If it happens, it would be formally announced by the election commission, they said.In view of the night curfew imposed by the state government, the Election Commission has issued revised orders on permitting loudspeakers.Officials said the loud speakers are allowed at public meetings and road shows only between 6am and 8pm for campaigning during the ensuing municipal elections.Prior to the night curfew orders, the election authorities had given permission for loud speaker usage between 6am and 10pm.Meanwhile, leaders of Congress , Telangana Jana Samithi and CPI have urged Telangana State Election Commissioner C Partha Sarathi to defer the municipal polls until the Covid-19 intensity comes down.In letters written to the election commissioner, G Niranjan of the Congress, M Kodandaram of TJS and Chada Venkat Reddy of CPI stated that going ahead with the elections to seven urban local bodies would be putting the lives of 15 lakh population, thousands of political leaders, election staff, police personnel and all their family members to risk of Covid-19 infection.Even Prime minister Narendra Modi has appealed to restrict the movement of people.âIt is unfortunate that the election commission is delaying in taking a wise decision by seeking the opinion of the state government and the health department.The TSEC should realise that elections should not be conducted during a pandemic.

","AP Lokayukta, Justice P Lakshman Reddy

HYDERABAD: Shocked at the extent and the impunity with which the wrongdoers are walking free even after swallowing crores of rupees of farmers' money, AP Lokayukta , Justice P Lakshman Reddy ordered a crackdown on the loan mafia operating within cooperative banks all over the state.

A sample survey, initiated by the district collectors, upon instructions from Lokayukta, in Guntur and East Godavari districts revealed startling facts that in just two areas in these two districts more than Rs 30 crore was swallowed by the perpetrators of the loan fraud.

Middlemen were entering the fray as farmers and availing huge farm loans from cooperative banks. In some cases, the farmers are unaware of the loans availed in their names. And in some more cases, the loans are raised by mortgaging land plots that never existed in the first place. What was more intriguing is the fact that the pattadar passbooks that were shown as the basis for availing these farm loans themselves were proved out to be fake ones created exclusively for the purpose of generating loans.

AP is at the forefront of distributing several monetary benefits to the farmers directly and the existence of bogus passbooks may defeat the objective of such schemes. In fact, Lokayukta has asked the chief secretary to get reports from all the district collectors, as well as bankers, collate them, and furnish the same to the Lokayukta court to arrive at the magnitude of the problem and also to devise ways to arrest the trend by plugging the loopholes. As the CS is yet to respond, the judge is now thinking in terms of reminding the state to act with the required sense of alacrity in the matter.

The scam and its perpetrators have acquired the status of a mafia because they were sending out signals that they are no lesser criminals than the ones that committed cooperative loan scams in states like Maharashtra , Madhya Pradesh where the magnitude of the scams has already crossed Rs 2000 crore. The police are already probing a similar scam that surfaced at Peddapalli in Telangana . The farmers in this area are now facing problems in uploading their details on the Dharani portal because they are being shown as defaulters of loans that they never availed of.

AP Lokayukta is now thinking in terms of finding a solution for the fake loans. Because the bankers are saying that they do not have the necessary wherewithal to verify whether a particular passbook is a genuine one or fake. And the revenue officials are saying that how will they know if someone chooses to go to a bank with fake title deeds and avail loans. There is a need to bring in a foolproof mechanism to ensure that money meant for farmers does not slip into the wrong hands, Justice Lakshmana Reddy said.

Tirupati: The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which controls the temple of Lord Balaji atop Tirumala hills, is all set to declare on Wednesday that Lord Hanuman was born in Andhra Pradesh . The TTD âs announcement will coincide with Sri Rama Navami celebrations. The richest temple trust in the country says its finding is based on a thorough study by a panel of experts comprising Vedic scholars, historians, and Hindu religious leaders.

TTD has been claiming that one of the seven hills of Seshachalam in Tirupati â Anjanadri hill â is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman. Now, its officials say they have evidence to back their claims. The expert committee recently submitted its report to TTD, which in turn will make the report public on Wednesday. According to TTD sources, Prasad , a Vedic scholar from Guntur, recently approached TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy with mythological, astrological as well as scientific evidence establishing Anjanadri hills in Tirumala as the birthplace of Lord Hanuman.

Following this the executive officer constituted an expert committee to study the documents submitted by the Vedic scholar. The panel also studied the places across the country where Lord Hanuman was believed to have been born, but settled for Tirumala hills as all the available evidence supported Anjanadri hill. Jawahar Reddy said, âWe are leaving the verdict to people to decide the actual birthplace of Lord Hanuman after making the report public.â

HYDERABAD: Two years after a disproportionate assets (DA) case was registered and Rs 4 crore worth assets were unearthed, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday arrested suspended GST assistant commissioner Bollineni Srinivasa Gandhi .

Sources in the CBI said Gandhi was arrested as he failed to cooperate with the investigation. Despite several notices issued by the investigating agency, Gandhi had refused to cooperate. Gandhi had earlier served in the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for more than seven years and handled high-profile money laundering cases.

Gandhi is also facing a CBI probe in another scandal. He along with suspended GST deputy commissioner (services tax anti-evasion) Chilaka Sudha Rani were named as accused in Rs 5 crore bribery scandal. The CBI, in July 2019, conducted searches on Gandhiâs properties in Hyderabad and Vijayawada and unearthed Rs 4 crore worth of assets.

Bribe giver Satya Sridhar Reddy Jagan Nagari, director of Bharani Commodities Private Ltd, an accused in the GST tax evasion case, was also booked by the CBI in the FIR issued on September 11, 2019.

Gandhi and Sudha Rani led investigation in March 2019 and detected a fake invoice fraud where Rs 1,289 crore was raised and found Rs 224 crore illegal input tax credit involving eight companies linked to Sridhar Reddy and others. The two officials were later accused of demanding Rs 5 crore bribe from Bharani Commodities. The duo accepted Rs 10 lakh cash in advance on April 15, 2019. Sridhar Reddy allegedly paid Rs 10 lakh to the officials to prevent the arrest of his wife in the case.

Gandhi had initially worked in the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence between 2002 and 2012 and later in the ED from 2012 to 2019. He later was made a superintendent in GST commissionerate and promoted, on an ad hoc basis, as assistant commissioner. He, however, was suspended from GST wing after the DA case was filed.

HYDERABAD: Bharat Biotech , the developer of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin , on Tuesday said it has expanded capacities across multiple facilities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru to reach 700 million doses annually. This would be one of the largest production capacities for inactivated viral vaccines worldwide.

While Bharat Biotech did not divulge any details on the schedule for the ramp-up, its chairman and managing director Dr Krishna Ella said on Tuesday that the company now has four production facilities in Hyderabad with two more slated to open up in Bengaluru. By July-August it will have the capacity to produce 700-800 million doses of Covaxin per year. He was speaking at an All India Management Association (AIMA) event on Tuesday.

He said the company produced 15 million doses in March and in April it will produce 20 million doses followed by 30 million doses in May when the Bengaluru facilities start functioning. The company has facilities at Genome Valley in Hyderabad, while its related entity Biovet Pvt Ltd has an animal vaccine facility at Malur near Bengaluru which is being repurposed for Covaxin.

The company also said it has not only successfully indigenised at commercial scale the synthesis and manufacture of the agonist IMDG, a key component of the proprietary adjuvant Algel-IMDG used to boost immune response in Covaxin recipients, it has also joined hands with Indian Immunologicals Ltd to manufacture the drug substance for Covaxin.

âThis is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India, eliminating dependency on imports. Also, the technology transfer process is well underway and IIL has the capabilities and expertise to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines at commercial scale and under biosafety containment,â it said.

Sources said the IIL facility will begin churning out the Covaxin drug substance for millions of doses from its new Genome Valley facility by July-August of this year.

Bharat Biotech also said that raw materials, packing materials and single-use consumables for manufacturing of Covaxin have been secured to meet its capacity requirements.

This even as the company is exploring manufacturing partnerships with its partners in other countries that have prior expertise in commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment.

The company said it was able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacities in a short timeline primarily due to the availability of new specially designed BSL-3 facilities that have been repurposed as well as pre-existing expertise and know-how to manufacture, test and release highly purified inactivated viral vaccines.

The company also for the first time opened up about its pricing strategy, stating that for international markets and supplies to government under EUA (emergency use authorisation) it has been established between $15-20 per dose. However, it did not indicate any pricing for the Indian private market. Currently, under the government vaccination programme the pricing has been capped at Rs 150 per dose.

However, at the AIMA session, Dr Ella said he would like to get the maximum price to recover all costs, including the Rs 350 crore spent on clinical trials in order to have money to work on vaccines for various infectious diseases.

Covaxin has so far received EUA in Mexico, Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana, Zimbabwe, even as EUAs are under process in over 60 countries including US and Europe.

","HYDERABAD: Authorities in Telangana may have declared Greater Hyderabad as the epicentre of Covid-19 cases in the second wave, but Nizamabad town is emerging as the new hotspot.While Greater Hyderabad, which has a population of 1.2 crore, reported around 700 cases in the last 24 hours, Nizamabad with a population of just 3.33 lakh topped 500 cases in the same period.The trend has been continuing for the past one week, officials said. The surge in the positive cases had never gone below 200 daily for a small district such as Nizamabad in the last fortnight. Nizamabad is about 175 km from Hyderabad.The district, which shares borders with Maharashtra, is giving jitters to officials with a positivity rate of 8% as against the stateâs positivity rate of 2.5%.âWe have declared 16 containment zones in the district. More number of positive cases are reported from municipalities and villages bordering Maharashtra,â collector C Narayan Reddy told TOI.Worried over increasing in-patient case load, the district administration has given permission to 20 more private hospitals to offer Covid-19 treatment in the last three days. Now, the bed capacity in the private hospitals has gone up to 400 from just about 20 in the last few days. In the government sector, there is a provision for 270 Covid-19 beds and 330 have been accommodated. Officials said the bed capacity in the government hospitals is being increased by another 200.âAmong the in-patients, 22% are below 40 years. The youth should not take the virus lightly and must follow Covid-19 guidelines of maintaining social distancing and wearing mask,â Dr Kiran Madala, associate professor in Government General Hospital (GGH) and ICU in-charge, Nizamabad, said.District authorities said there have been several instances of large gatherings of people in recent times and attributed the spurt in cases to super-spreaders infecting several others. In Varni, a marriage function led to 86 positive cases and a shopping hall had reported 30 cases.Though officials closed 18 checkpoints in the district, Salura and Salabatpur checkposts with Maharashtra are still kept open. Officials said Covid-19 case load is high from these areas. âThe positivity rate from the surrounding areas is more than 15%,â a senior official said.Fearing more outbreaks, several villages in the district are opting for lockdowns. Three mandals of Bhimgal, Erugatla and Balkonda declared self-lockdown a few days ago.

HYDERABAD: A 22-year-old painter has been arrested for his alleged role in the recent murder of a farmer at Railapur village. Police said the accused committed the offence to steal Rs 7,000 cash from the victim.

On April 15, the body of M Sathyanarayana, 45, a farmer from Nagaloor village in Dundigal, was found in an open land at Railapur village near Medchal. The assailants bludgeoned Sathyanarayana to death and dropped his scooter on his legs, Medchal police said.

"The poll panel cited election law and various steps it has taken to ensure safety of voters to rule out any change

The Election Commission on Wednesday told the Trinamool Congress that its suggestion to club the remaining three phases of West Bengal assembly polls was not implementable.

In a letter to the Trinamool Congress, the poll panel cited election law and various steps it has taken to ensure safety of voters in view of the coronavirus pandemic to rule out any change in the poll schedule for the state.

While phase six of the West Bengal polls is scheduled on April 22, the seventh and eighth phases are on April 26 and 29.","She iterates her demand for proper supply of vaccines and oxygen from the central government.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Wednesday ruled out the possibility of lockdown in the state in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19 and said universal vaccination for those who are above 18 will start from May 5.

The Election Commission should take steps to ensure that postal ballot facilities are made available for COVID-19 patients admitted in hospitals, the Trinamool Congress chief said.

She iterated her demand for proper supply of vaccines and oxygen from the central government.

We are not in favour of any lockdown. We want everyone to adhere to COVID-19 norms such as wearing masks, maintaining social distancing norms and using sanitisers. We dont want people to return to the days of being forced to stay back at homes, she said.

""Notebandi r moto grihobandi"" (forced to stay at home like forced to go through the travails of demonetisation).

Lockdown is not a solution as it takes a heavy toll on people, jobs, economy, she said addressing a press conference in Malda.

Criticising the disparity in vaccine prices, Ms. Banerjee said it is the duty of the Centre to ensure that it is not so.

I am writing a strong letter to the Centre on the discrimination in the pricing of the vaccines. The vaccine producing companies are charging different rates from the Centre, States and private hospitals for the same vaccine, she said.

""Why this discrimination? Is this time to make business with vaccines? she asked.

In West Bengal, universal vaccination from the age of 18 will start from May 5 as the election process is still on and will be over on May 2, she said.

Demanding proper supply of vaccines and oxygen from the central government, the Chief Minister said ""So far around one crore people has been vaccinated in Bengal. We have already applied for one crore more doses of the vaccines as there is a severe shortage. The Centre should ensure smooth supply of vaccine, medicine and oxygen,"" she said.

Ms. Banerjee asked State Government officials to ensure that there is no black marketing of oxygen cylinders as there is severe shortage of it in West Bengal.

She said the EC should introduce a process to ensure that the corona-affected who are in hospitals can vote through postal ballot in the remaining three phases of polling for the West Bengal Assembly.","He had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in April

Eminent poet and critic Sankha Ghosh passed away in Kolkata on Wednesday. The Jnanpith awardee was 89 and had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in April.

He was under home isolation for the past few days, but his condition deteriorated late on Tuesday. He is survived by wife and two daughters.

Ghosh was one of most important names in Bengali poetry and, together with Shakti Chattopadhyay, Alokeranjan Dasgupta and Sunil Gangopadhyay, was said to have carried on the baton from the poets of the early part of the 20th century, such as Jibanananda Das and Buddhadev Basu.

He was awarded the Jnanpith Award in 2016 and the Padma Bhushan in 2011. In the shadow of the Rabindranath Tagore era, poets such as Ghosh took the legacy forward.

Considered an authority on Tagore, Ghosh was awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1977 for his poetry collection Babarer Prarthana.

He was born on February 6, 1932, in Chandpur, which is in present-day Bangladesh. The poet graduated in Bengali honours from Presidency College in 1951 and did his post-graduation at University of Calcutta.

He taught at a number of educational institutes, including Visva Bharati University, Delhi University and Jadavpur University. He retired from Jadavpur University in 1992.

Silent protester

Ghosh was a man of few words. Though he was considered one of the greatest of poets, he chose silence even when protesting against the violence and violation of human rights towards the end of the Left Front regime. At the most, he would issue written statements.

The poet had also expressed strong opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act through a poem called Mati. His other well-known poems are Andolan, Mukh Dheke Jaye Biggapone, Chup Koro and Bohiragoto.

“Following the demise of Sankha Ghosh, we extend our deep condolences. I have directed the Chief Secretary and final rites will be performed with full State honours,” West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said.

Ms. Banerjee also added that since the poet was not in favour of a “gun salute,” it would not be part of the ceremony.

Noted Bengali poet Joy Goswami said Ghosh was the conscience of Bengali society. “The Bengali literary circle will feel a void created by his death more and more.”

Writer Sirshendu Mukhopadhyay, recalling his decades-long association with the poet, said that despite several awards and laurels “there was not even a hint of pride in him”.","Ms. Banerjee asserted that West Bengal will be run only by a “Bengal engine government” and not by “Modi's double-engine.”

Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that the second COVID-19 wave in the country and its management is a ""Modi-made disaster"".

Addressing an election rally at Balurghat in Dakshin Dinajpur district, the TMC chief asserted that West Bengal will be run only by a ""Bengal engine government"" and not by ""Modi's double-engine"".

""The second COVID wave is more intense. I would say this is a Modi-made disaster. There are no injections or oxygen. Vaccines and medicines are being shipped abroad even as there is a scarcity of these items in the country,"" she told the rally.

She claimed that this election is a fight to save West Bengal and ""protect the honour of the Bengali mother"".

""Our State will be run by a Bengal engine government and not by Modi's double-engine government. We will not allow Gujarat to capture our State or run it from Delhi. Bengal will rule Bengal,"" Ms. Banerjee said.

The term ""double-engine government"" often used by BJP leaders denotes the government of the same party at the Centre and the State.

The TMC chief also urged people not to vote for Left-Congress-ISF alliance candidates claiming that voting for them will strengthen the BJP's hand.

Ms. Banerjee said that the Centre had said seven months ago that the pandemic has subsided. ""Now, with elections underway in West Bengal, the BJP is bringing in people from other States and spreading the infection among the people here,"" she said.

She said that her administration is finding it difficult to set up safe homes as many government accommodations are being used to house central forces.

""We are finding it difficult to set up safe homes. Although we have increased the number of beds, I would suggest that patients who don't have severe symptoms, please remain in home isolation,"" Ms. Banerjee said.

She claimed that the BJP is saying different things at different places on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). She said that refugees who have come to West Bengal have been given land rights.

""You are all citizens of the State. So don't worry. I will act as a watchman,"" she said.

Ms. Banerjee said that in the last 10 years, the TMC government has built roads, hospitals, bridges, stadia and an industrial centre in Dakshin Dinajpur district.

Elections to the 294-member state assembly are being held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29. Results will be announced on May 2.

"The virus has spread rapidly in Cuddalore town

With surge in COVID-19 cases in Cuddalore district, the number of containment zones across the district has increased over the last few weeks.

The number of containment zones have gone up from 18 to 46, majority of them during the last three weeks, in Cuddalore. As on Wednesday, the district had a total of 827 active cases.

The infection, which was earlier restricted to rural pockets and semi-urban areas, has now spread rapidy in Cuddalore town prompting authorities to declare several residential areas as containment zones.

In the last few days, several areas within the jurisdiction of Cuddalore municipality and Neyveli township have been earmarked as containment zones. According to an official, streets with three or more cases have been declared as containment zones with a view to checking the spread of the pandemic. “Movement of people has been restricted in these places with the government supplying essential items to those residing in the areas.”

“We have also intensified the screening of residents by conducting fever camps in the containment zones. On an average, over 300 fever camps are being conducted in the district,” the official added.","On Tuesday night, Villianur police received a call regarding a polythene bag found dumped near the graveyard in Porayur.

The body of a 19-year-old undergraduate girl student from Sandhai Pudukuppam near Thirukkanur was found stuffed inside a polythene bag near a graveyard at Porayur in Puducherry late Tuesday.

Police identified the victim as R. Rajashree, a first year B.B.A student of a private college in Sedurapet. On Tuesday night, the Villianur police received a call regarding a polythene bag found dumped near the graveyard in Porayur.

A police team opened the bag and found the body of the girl. The body had injuries on the head and face. The body was shifted to the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute (IGMCRI).

A case has been registered and further investigations are on.","A complete lockdown has been declared in Puducherry during the weekend starting 10 p.m. on Friday till 5 a.m. on Monday. From Monday, shops and establishments would be open only from 5 a.m. to 2 p.m. until further notice.

This was decided at a high-level meeting, chaired by Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Tuesday. Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar, Advisers to the Lt.Governor C. Chandramouli and A.P Maheshwari, and other top officials participated in the review.","The administration will revive the ₹500-fine for those violating home quarantine norms, Health Secretary T. Arun said on Tuesday.

The fine, which was in place during the 2020-pandemic phase, would be re-notified shortly, he told at a press conference.

Last year, the government had imposed ₹500 for those jumping home quarantine and ₹1,000 for violators of isolation norms as part of stringent measures to cut the spread of the virus.

The Health Secretary said a dedicated ambulance fleet had been made available for the smooth transportation of COVID-19 patients from home to hospital or in between healthcare facilities. As part of this, an ambulance each has been provided to a cluster of three PHCs across eight zones for transportation of COVID-19 patients to a healthcare facility, he said. All that had to be done for anyone testing positive was to contact the helpline 104 and the ambulance would be despatched to the house of the patient.

Mr. Arun pointed out that there has not been a single adverse reaction reported since the COVID-19 vaccination programme was rolled out in the Union Territory and had benefited over 1.70 lakh persons to date.

Appealing to those who were yet to take the COVID-19 vaccination to utilise the service which had been made available across multiple facilities and the process simplified, Mr. Arun said there was no need for hesitancy or anxiety to take the jab as there had been no adverse incident even after vaccinating an estimated 12 crore of the population in the country so far.

He also pointed out that while many States faced a shortage of vaccines, the Union Territory had stocks available. The proven strategy against coronavirus was to follow the simple measures of wearing mask, sanitising and social distancing and now, taking the vaccine.","Over 300 anganwadi workers tasked with carrying out door-to-door visits to check on health status of patients on a daily basis

With the recent spike in new cases in the second coming of the coronavirus, health officials have ramped up monitoring of home isolation cases through a combination of remote and door-to-door outreach measures designed to guide recovery by avoiding a hospital visit as far as possible.

Proportionate to the spurt in new COVID-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic has been the enlargement of the pool of home isolation cases in the Union Territory.

Health officials estimate that there has been a 20-fold increase in COVID-19 cases compared to the figures in early March. This trend has simultaneously pushed up the number of home isolation cases in the Union Territory.

As on Tuesday, of the 5,073 active cases, 4,169 patients were in home isolation.

“With 80% of patients testing positive for COVID-19 remaining asymptomatic, the focus is on guiding their recovery without the need for a hospital visit, ” said T. Arun, Health Secretary.

The first point of triaging is at local PHCs, where a patient who tests positive is evaluated to determine between hospitalisation or home isolation, based on ICMR guidelines. If closely monitored and followed by at the level of each PHC, very few home isolation patients experience aggravation of symptoms to a state of emergency that warrants their hospitalisation in a critical care facility.

“This is more or less the strategy everywhere as hospitalising an asymptomatic patient will use up precious resources, from beds to clinical care, that are otherwise critical for the treatment of the moderate-to-severely ill coronavirus patients,” he said.

A team of over 300 anganwadi workers has been tasked with carrying out door-to-door visits to check on the health status of patients on a daily basis. In addition to this, ASHA volunteers are carrying out daily house visits as part of surveillance measures.

Consultation services

The outreach measures also include consultation services over the IVRS and a round-the-clock helpline 104.

At a recent video call with ICMR experts, chaired by Lt. Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, the home monitoring strategy was one of the elaborately-discussed issues.

The expert advice of an ICMR panel, led by Prabhdeep Kaur, was to equip anganwadi workers with pulse oximeters to check oxygen saturation levels of patients on alternate days and to develop intermediary care (COVID care centres) in between hospital and home isolation points of care.

Mortality analysis

“What we are also seeing from our death audits is that during surveillance visits, people hesitate to disclose whether they are running a temperature or suffering from a headache or body pain. Many of these persons may have been infected and by the time they turn weak and require hospitalisation, precious time in diagnosis and treatment is lost,” Mr. Arun said.

In fact, mortality analysis in the second wave is virtually mirroring the 2020 pandemic pattern.

Late diagnosis and delay in reporting to hospital is contributing to 75% of recent COVID-19 fatalities, the Health Secretary said.

In a majority of recent deaths, patients who died with 24 hours to 48 hours of hospitalisation had waited for five or six days without undergoing a test for their symptoms and reached a healthcare facility only after severe breathing difficulty.

Health officials have appealed to everyone to visit a PHC and get tested for coronavirus symptoms, such as a persistent cough, running nose, or fever.

Officials also urged for utmost compliance with safety protocols — masking, hand sanitising and social distancing, along with the fourth pillar of vaccination — as one of the distinguishing features of the second wave of the pandemic has been its unusually high transmissiblity.

Street-level zoning and partial restrictions in a radius around areas with high number of home isolation cases is also being implemented.","Transfer may be initiated only after hospital confirms a bed with facilities

JIPMER has issued an advisory for referral of critically-ill COVID-19 patients from other hospitals in the wake of an increase in the number of serious and critical patients requiring hospitalisation.

A press note from JIPMER said that the institution was trying its best to accommodate such patients while also trying to maintain its non-COVID operations as far as possible.

It also stated that in recent days, many critically-ill COVID patients referred from other hospitals have arrived at JIPMER’s COVID-care facility without any prior intimation.

“This leads to unnecessary delay and affects patient care adversely, particularly when the receiving facility is exceptionally busy or a vacant bed is not available,” JIPMER Director Rakesh Aggarwal said.

In the interest of patient safety, JIPMER has urged that any hospital or clinic wishing to refer a serious patient, who needs oxygen or intensive care or has significant co-morbidities, should contact the institution in advance over phone — the numbers were being shared directly with the neighbouring hospitals — and over the email covidreferraljipmer@

gmail.com

The transfer may be initiated only after JIPMER confirms that a bed with appropriate facilities has been earmarked for that particular patient.

Patient’s interest

This would avoid the unpleasant situation of a serious patient reaching JIPMER and having to return because of lack of a bed. The press note also stipulated that only a referring doctor who knows the patient’s clinical details should call the shared numbers.

Patients or their relatives are advised not to contact on these numbers or email ID, and their queries would not be entertained, the press note said.","Four more deaths raise toll to 717; recovery rate at 88.18%

The sale process will start within a couple of weeks, they added, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.

The move comes after Citi said it would exit its consumer franchises in 13 markets — 10 of which are in Asia and include India — as it refocusses on its more lucrative institutional and wealth management businesses in these markets.

Potential bids from the regional banks and StanChart, whichmakes most of its profit in Asia, underscores their growingappetite for businesses like credit cards and mortgages in apush to lock in long-term income growth.

The businesses Citi is exiting had $82 billion in assets andwere allocated $7 billion in tangible common equity last year.Citi has plans to reposition its Asian consumer banking businessfrom its “wealth centres” of Hong Kong and Singapore.

As Citi is not giving up its banking licences in most of themarkets it is exiting, the sale of the consumer bankingportfolios and branches will only appeal to lenders withexisting presence in these countries, the people said.

“Asia is critical to our firm’s strategy, and we willallocate resources to drive profitable growth,” a Citi spokesmanin Hong Kong said, declining to comment on the sale process.

Representatives at Japanese lender MUFG and StanChart, andSumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, which the sources saidwas another potential bidder, declined to comment.

“DBS has always been open to exploring sensible bolt-onopportunities in markets where we have a consumer bankingfranchise (China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan) and where we canoverlay our digital capabilities,” Southeast Asia’s biggestlender said in a statement.

Citi’s sprawling India consumer business, comprising retaildeposits, mortgages and credit cards, and its Taiwan businesswould be among the most valuable parts of its Asian consumerportfolio, the sources said.

Citi’s consumer banking business in the 13 markets accountedfor $4.2 billion of the bank’s $74.3 billion revenue in 2020.All the markets it is exiting made a combined loss of $40million in the consumer banking business in the same year.

"‘Highly transmissible second wave’ with newer variants may contribute to reinfection.

Officials said that a “small” fraction of those vaccinated with either Covaxin or Covishield have tested positive. However, these instances of “breakthrough” infections do not undermine the efficacy of the vaccines.

“These vaccines definitely, definitely protect against disease. However, the immune response begins to develop usually two weeks after every dose and there are variations within individuals, too. Even after the first dose, if exposure to the virus happens, one can test positive,” said Dr. Balram Bhargava, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Of the 9.3 million who received the first dose of Covaxin, 4,208 tested positive; and of the 1.7 million who received the second dose, 695 tested positive.

For Covishield, of the 100.3 million who received the first dose, 17,145 tested positive; and of the 15 million who got the second dose, 5,014 tested postive.

Two key reasons for this, according to Dr. Bhargava, were that healthcare and frontline workers, who were among the first to be vaccinated, were as a population far more exposed to the virus and therefore more susceptible. Secondly, the emergence of “the highly transmissible second wave (newer variants) ” may have contributed to instances of infection among those vaccinated.

Several variants, which have mutations that have been shown to avoid detection by the immune system, and in some cases reduce the efficacy of vaccines, have been reported globally, including in India.

“This is roughly around 2 in 10,000 and is a very, very small fraction. We have seen similar rates of reinfection internationally too from the use of other vaccines,” Dr. V.K. Paul, Chairman, NEGVAC (National Expert Group on Vaccination), the committee that oversees the COVID-19 management strategy.

When comparing patterns of infection and mortality in the first and second waves of the pandemic, a slight percentage increase in cases among those in the 10-20 years age group is seen in the current wave — 8.5% compared to 8.07% earlier. There is an increase in cases among those in the 40-70 years age group from the previous wave, and the same fraction of those in the 30-40 years age group persists.

In terms of deaths — that is now nearly 2,000 a day — COVID-19 continues to be disproportionately fatal for those over 70 years. There were 22% deaths among those in the 70-80 years in the second wave compared to 19% in the first wave, and 9.8% deaths in those above 80 compared to 7.8% previously.

There is no evidence of any change in patterns of death in the younger age groups of 30-70 years, with about 70% deaths during both waves falling in this age bracket. However, for the mortality comparison, a far smaller sample — 24,814 — was used in the second wave compared with the 83,189 in the first wave.

Secretary, Health Ministry, Rajesh Bhushan, said the severity of the second wave meant that efforts were on to mitigate it and save lives, and only in the days ahead, with the benefit of hindsight, would it be possible to discern how India was attacked by a severe second wave.

There are 146 districts reporting a test positivity of over 15%, and these are the places were the hospital facilities are most taxed. There are 274 districts where case positivity is between 5% and 15%, and 308 districts where it is less than 5%.

India’s case fatality rate, Mr. Bhushan said, is at 1.17% and on decreasing trend from March 22, when it was 1.37%.","Sukh-Dukh Helpline aids people cope with losses due to the pandemic

Efforts are being ramped up for massive production of vaccines and make them available in the shortest possible time, a top government official said on Wednesday, stressing that India currently has a promising pipeline of four-five COVID-19 vaccine candidates, while three have already been approved for emergency use.

Department of Biotechnology Secretary Renu Swarup said a financial support of ₹400 crore is being provided to vaccine candidates from Zydus Cadilla, Biological E, Gennova and Bharat Biotech (single-dose intranasal vaccine).

Her statement came days after the government widened the vaccination drive to cover everybody above the 18 years of age.

""There are three vaccines in India, which have been approved for Emergency Use Authorisation -- Covishield by Serum Institute of India (SII), Covaxin by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. (BBIL) and the Russian vaccine, Sputnik-V. Besides these, there is promising pipeline of 4-5 candidates in advanced clinical stages of development,"" Ms. Swarup told PTI.

DNA Vaccine candidate by Zydus Cadila, protein subunit vaccine candidate by BioE, mRNA vaccine candidate by Gennova, and single dose intranasal vaccine candidate by Bharat Biotech are in advanced stages of clinical trials, she said. ""The Department of Biotechnology has provided technical, advisory and financial support for these vaccine candidates during their early development. Now, under Mission COVID Suraksha, financial support of nearly ₹400 crore for late stage clinical development of these vaccine candidates is being provided.

The 2021 World Press Freedom Index produced by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a French NGO, has again placed India at 142nd rank out of 180 countries. This despite the fact that for a year, under directions from the Cabinet Secretary, an Index Monitoring Cell worked to improve the world rankings, including a meeting between Ambassador to France with the RSF officials to lobby for a change in the ranking in the index compiled by them.

In 2016, India’s rank was 133 which has steadily climbed down to 142 in 2020. The RSF report says India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly. They are exposed to every kind of attack, including police violence against reporters, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials.

Fearing such an adverse assessment, in February last year, on the directions of Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, the Index Monitoring Cell was set up in 18 Ministries to find ways to improve the position on 32 international indices. Information and Broadcasting Ministry was delegated to look at the freedom of press index.

As per the report of this Index Monitoring Cell, accessed by The Hindu, on April 26 last year, the PIB Additional Director General first wrote to Chairman of the RSF Pierre Haski asking for criteria for the survey on the basis of which they compile the index, for better understanding of the ranking. This was followed by a meeting between Ambassador to France Javed Ashraf with RSF’s Secretary General Christophe Deloire and Head of Asia Pacific desk Daniel Bastard.

The minutes of this September meeting are part of the report of the Cell. Mr. Ashraf said the openness of the government to be criticised and questioned with respect to subjects like economy, international affairs and defence deals like Rafale are indicators of press freedom.

Questions on Internet ban in J&K

The RSF representatives however questioned the extended Internet ban in Jammu and Kashmir from August 5, 2019 which went on to nearly a year. The Ambassador said the shutdown was for the security of the region. “Members of the press could access the Internet through the Internet kiosks set up by the government and there was active reporting in Indian and international media on the situation in Kashmir, which could only have been possible with unhindered access to the Internet and freedom of the press,” the minutes say.

The minutes also note that on the issue of violence raised by the RSF, Mr. Ashraf said “many incidents reported as attacks on journalists are often a consequence of the law and order situation in some areas of India. This is often misrepresented as targeted attacks on journalists by the State in western media”.","‘Work to bring bilateral relations back to the track of sound and steady development,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman says.

China said on Wednesday that it was committed to maintaining peace and stability along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) as it urged India to put the boundary issue at an ""appropriate position"" and meet it ""halfway"" for the long term development of the bilateral ties.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said this at his media briefing as he parried questions on India's assertion that consensus reached by the leaders on maintaining peace along the border cannot be swept under the carpet.

Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri in his recent address to the India-China dialogue forum said that the significance of the consensus reached between leaders of the two countries to maintain peace along the LAC cannot be ""swept under the carpet"" and called for the complete disengagement of troops in Eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the ""serious incidents"".

In a candid address to the ICWA (Indian Council of World Affairs)-CPIFA (Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs) virtual dialogue on April 15, Mr. Misri also questioned the Chinese officials ignoring the ""significant consensus"" reached by the leaders of the two sides about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.

Asked for his reaction, Mr. Wang said that both sides held in-depth and candid talks on resolving the disengagement from the remaining areas of Eastern Ladakh after the withdrawal from Pangong Tso lake area.

Top commanders of the two militaries held the 11th round of talks on April 9 to disengage the troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang areas in Eastern Ladakh.

Ongoing talks

""On the issue of China-India boundary situation, China’s position is consistent and clear. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and we are firmly determined to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and security,"" Mr. Wang said.

""Recently, the two sides have maintained communications through diplomatic and military channels. On the basis of disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso regions, the two sides exchanged in depth and in a candid manner, opinions on resolving the remaining issue in the Western section of the boundary,"" he said.

""We hope India will meet China halfway and will focus on the bigger picture of long term development of bilateral relations, put the boundary at an appropriate position and work to bring relations back to the track of steady and sound development,"" he said.

To a follow-up question on Mr. Misri’s remarks, Mr. Wang reiterated that ""we hope that India will meet China halfway and focus on the long-term development of bilateral relations, cherish the existing hard-won momentum for the de-escalation and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border and work to bring bilateral relations back to the track of sound and steady development"".

Asked why China is not disengaging its troops from the remaining areas after the withdrawal from Pangong Tso, Mr. Wang said, ""I would like to stress that recently, China and India, through diplomatic and military channels. maintained close communications"".

""On the basis of realising disengagement in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso, the two sides held candid and in-depth exchange of views on resolving remaining issues in the Western section of the boundary,” he said.

""We hope that the Indian side will abide by the agreements between the two militaries and consensus of the two sides and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,"" he said.

India’s call for ‘sustainable solution’

In his address, Mr. Misri said the ""sustainable solution"" to the ""present difficulties"" in the Sino-India relations is ""it must be one, as External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar has suggested, that is based on mutual sensitivity and respect and paves the way for maximizing our mutual interests"".

""The first is to note the importance of the two sides having maintained a sustained diplomatic and military dialogue in attempting to resolve issues. These discussions thus far have helped in achieving substantial disengagement of our forces,” he said.

""The second is to point out that senior leaders on both sides have committed and agreed that we must achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas. That would be an important first step towards considering de-escalation; it would also help in restoring peace and tranquility and, together, these would provide conditions for gradual and step-by-step progress in the bilateral relationship,” he said.

""This is also what would begin to restore trust and confidence in the relationship and help us rebuild the foundation of the relationship that was damaged through last year's actions in Eastern Ladakh,"" Mr. Misri had said.","Congress reiterates demand of ‘one nation, one price’ for vaccines

The Congress on Wednesday criticised the Centre over differential pricing of the Covishield vaccine, with former Union minister Jairam Ramesh calling it “atrocious” that the Centre could procure it for ₹150 per dose but States would have to pay ₹400 per dose.

While former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram posed a series of questions on Twitter, party general secretary Ajay Maken, at an online press conference, charged the Narendra Modi government of reducing India from being “a vaccine leader to a vaccine beggar”.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “India still has no Covid strategy. Exporting oxygen & vaccines when our own people are dying is nothing short of a crime.”

The party lashed out at the Modi government for not preparing for the second wave. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, in an interview to news agency ANI, said, “This government can speak to ISI. They are speaking to ISI in Dubai. Can’t they talk to Opposition leaders? I don’t think there is any Opposition leader who is not giving them constructive and positive suggestions...The government needs to be sensitive at this time the Prime Minister needs to show up, he needs to get off the stage of the rally where he is laughing and cracking jokes. He needs to come here, sit in front of people, talk to them and tell them how is he going to save lives.”

“Manmohan Singh-ji was Prime Minister for 10 years. Everyone knows how dignified a person he is. If he is giving suggestions when the nation is facing a pandemic, then suggestions should be taken up with the same dignity with which they were offered,” she added.

Ms. Vadra flagged off the issue of shortage of vaccines because of “the Modi government’s PR exercise”, lack of planning to ensure smooth supply of oxygen despite India being its largest producer, and allowing export of critical drugs like Remdesivir as well as oxygen.

The party also sharply reacted to the announcement by the Serum Institute of India (SII) on vaccine pricing. Mr. Ramesh tweeted, “The Central government will continue to pay ₹150 per dose for Covishield. State governments will now be charged ₹400 a dose. This is not cooperative federalism. This will bleed dry the already reeling State finances. Atrocious. We demand One Nation, One Price for Centre and State governments.”

“Who will pay the ₹400 for one dose in government hospitals? The State government or the beneficiary? How many persons between 18 and 44 years can afford to pay ₹400 per dose? Will the beneficiary be burdened with the cost ? How many States would be willing to pay the price of the vaccine and subsidise the people?” asked Mr. Chidambaram.

Attacking the government over the shortage of oxygen, Remdesivir and other equipment at his press conference, Mr. Maken said the Centre must deploy the National Investigation Agency and the Enforcement Directorate against traders who were resorting to the black marketing of life-saving drugs. The Congress leader also reiterated the party’s demand to transfer ₹6,000 per month to poor families during lockdown or curfew.","The release of the statistics follows growing panic in the country over concerns that the second wave is somehow more powerful and could cause greater havoc.

The Health Ministry on Wednesday released a slew of comparative data, showing that the severity, virulence and demography of the victims in the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 are about the same as the first wave.

Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 146 districts reported COVID-19 positivity rate of more than 15%, while 274 districts reported case positivity between 5% and 15%.

The release of the statistics follows growing panic in the country over concerns that the second wave is somehow more powerful and could cause greater havoc.

According to the figures shared by Bhushan, 4.03%COVID-19 cases were reported in the first wave in those below 10 years, while 2.97% cases were registered in the second wave.

“In he age group 10-20 years, 8.07% COVID-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 8.50% cases were registered in the second wave. In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41% cases were reported in the first wave, while 19.35% cases ere registered in the second wave,” he said.

Mr. Bhushan further shared data which showed that in those aged 30 and above, 67.5% COVID-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 69.18% cases registered in second wave.","Producers, arhtiyas happy over wheat procurement, says Punjab Food Minister

With wheat harvesting in full swing in Punjab and Haryana, farmers, for the first time, have started receiving minimum support price (MSP) payment directly in their bank accounts under the Direct Benefit Transfer Scheme (DBT).

The government data shows ₹5,385 crore has been transferred so far in the ongoing procurement season by the Central and State procurement agencies to farmers against purchase of their crops in both the States.

In Punjab, ₹2,600 crore has been paid to accounts of farmers till April 20 under the scheme. In Haryana, ₹2,785 crore have been transferred directly to the accounts of farmers.

Punjab Food Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu said “under the DBT scheme payments more than ₹2,600 crore has been paid to the accounts of farmers till April 20”.

He said 54 lakh tonnes of wheat have arrived in ‘mandis’ till April 20, out of which 50 lakh tonnes have been procured and more than 20 lakh tonnes lifted by various government agencies. “In Punjab, both the farmers and the arhtiyas [commission agents] are happy over the wheat procurement.”

Amid the ongoing procurement and payments under the DBT, several farmers in Ludhiana district have expressed contentment over the new mechanism. Harinderpal Singh, who had sold his wheat crop in Machhiwara grain market on April 12, said he was happy as ₹1,95,525 was deposited directly into his bank account without any problem. Expressing similar sentiments, another farmer Sukhjit Singh of village Todarpur said ₹2,31,667 was deposited directly into his bank account promptly.

Praptej Singh, a farmer from Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar, said he had sold his wheat on April 13 at the grain market in Chandigarh’s sector 39, and he received payment within five days. “The new [DBT] system is effective. I received timely payment without any follow-up with anyone.”

In Haryana, ₹2,785 crore has been transferred directly to the accounts of farmers till April 20, according to an official statement.

The Haryana government on Wednesday procured 3.11 lakh tonnes through various procurement agencies on the MSP.

Of the 64.77 lakh tonnes of wheat that arrived at procurement centres till April 20, 55.62 lakh tonnes have been procured.","The vaccines, however, would not retail until 4-5 months and corporates and private individuals could in the meantime only get these vaccines from ‘State-facilitated machinery,’ says a statement.

From May 1, Serum Institute of India (SII) will be selling Covishield to State governments at ₹400 dose and to private hospitals at ₹600 dose, Adar Poonawala, CEO, SII said in a statement on Wednesday.

The vaccines, however, would not retail until 4-5 months and corporates and private individuals could in the meantime only get these vaccines from “State-facilitated machinery,” his statement added.

On Monday, when announcing vaccination for all above 18, the Centre said vaccine companies could sell half their approved lot of vaccines in the open market, opening up avenues for States to directly procure them without intervention from the Centre.

States have, however, expressed reservation. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that such a policy would place additional burden on States’ finances. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said the policy amounted to States abdicating their responsibility.

Currently, Covishield constitutes over 90% of India's vaccine supply and is learnt to be sold to the Centre at ₹150-200 per dose. As of Wednesday, 130 million doses have been administered to those over 45, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Due to the ongoing spike in the second wave that is seeing close to 3,00,000 cases added daily, there is also an increased public clamour for vaccines that has exposed shortages in the Centre's ability to supply vaccines to States.

In an interview to CNBC TV 18, Mr. Poonawala said that his company had sold 100 million doses at ₹150 a dose, was fulfilling a fresh order from the Centre of 110 million doses at ₹2,000 crore (about ₹180 a dose) but in the future would also charge the Centre ₹400 a dose. “I've always maintained that ₹1,000 a dose would be a reasonable price. However in the early days we had to support the country and so had agreed to reduced prices.”

Currently, Serum is producing 60-70 million doses a month, and is hoping to ramp up supply to 100 million doses a month by July, he added.

Current plans for increasing supply suggest that it would not be before early June that both Covishield and Covaxin would be able to substantially increase production.

Covishield, from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable, comprises over 90% of the 12.76 crore COVID-19 vaccines administered across the country so far, according to government data on Wednesday.

Of this, 15 States and union territories have only given Covishield, being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Instiute of India. The other vaccine being administered in India is the indigenous Covaxin from Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad.

Giving details, of the 127,605,870 COVID-19 vaccination jabs administered till now, 11,60,65,107 are of Covishield while 1,15,40,763 are of Covaxin, according to the government's CO-WIN portal.

Moreover, about 15 States and union territories, including Goa, Chandigarh and Jammu and Kashmir, have administered only Covishield to its beneficiaries.

Experts said Covishield is being produced at a much higher scale than Covaxin due to which its availability is more.

Dr. Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said soon the production of Covaxin will be ramped up.

“Following which, the vaccine production capacity will increase significantly,” he said.

Bharat Biotech on Tuesday said capacity expansion has been implemented across multiple facilities in Hyderabad and Bangalore, to reach approximately 700 million doses per year.

The Department of Biotechnology is also providing financial support as grants to vaccine manufacturing facilities for enhanced production capacities.

“The current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin vaccine will be doubled by May-June 2021 and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August 2021 i.e increasing the production from 10 million vaccine doses in April, 2021 to 60-70 million vaccine dose per month in July-August,” said the ministry of science and technology in a statement on Monday.

The positive tests are significant as Hong Kong is regularly recording fewer daily cases than the total detected on the flight since it brought a fourth wave under control in January.

Authorities have now imposed a two-week ban on all flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines that began on Monday, categorising the countries as “extremely high risk” after detecting the N501Y mutant COVID-19 strain for the first time in the local community.

The positive COVID-19 results surfaced while the arrivals were undergoing Hong Kon’s mandatory three-week quarantine period, one of the strictest entry regimes in the world.

All travellers flying into the territory from 25 places deemed high-risk, including Britain, South Africa, India, Pakistan and the United States, must also provide a negative test within 72 hours prior to departure.

Several COVID-19 cases have also been detected on flights arriving in Hong Kong from Mumbai, authorities said.

In an interview with IANS, Ms. Vadra said “the lack of planning and preparation between the first and the second wave is the worst act of negligence and incompetent governance”.

“The Prime Minister has completely failed to provide a sense of safety, direction or leadership during this massive human crisis we are facing. It is shocking that just day before yesterday [Sunday], he was on a public stage addressing thousands of people with no COVID protocol and laughing while doing so. What is there to laugh about? The entire country is in tears,” she said.

“There are no hospital beds available, medicines are running short, crematoriums are full, frontline workers are exhausted...Where is the leadership? Where is the planning? Why are we short of facilities? Where is the money from the PM fund being used? Why has he done nothing to address the five major shortages of vaccines, beds, ventilators, oxygen and Remdesivir? Will he take responsibility for the bad planning and incompetence of his government?” she asked.

She said at a time when the government should be focussing on fighting the catastrophic situation, the Prime Minister continues to address election rallies.

“Even constructive suggestions from the Opposition parties are being dismissed as politicisation rather than being accepted in the spirit that the nation is in a grave crisis and every single life matters. Therefore, all of us must stand together and do whatever we can to save lives,” Ms. Vadra said.

In a separate tweet, she said the government failed the country to provide oxygen despite being its largest producer.

“India produces 7500 MT of O2 per day. We are one of the biggest producers in the world. O2 shortage is due to lack of logistics to transport it. Govt. has failed us.

“The Internet never sleeps and the Internet never forgets,” the Delhi High Court remarked on Tuesday, while issuing a slew of directions to deal with the complications in removing offending content such as photographs and videos from pornographic websites.

Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said that a court, when approached with such a grievance, shall issue a direction to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted, to remove such content forthwith, and in any event within 24 hours of receipt of the court order.

“A direction should also be issued to the website or online platform on which the offending content is hosted to preserve all information and associated records relating to the offending content...at least for a period of 180 days...for use in investigation,” the High Court added.

The case stems from a petition by a woman who claimed that her photographs and images, though not in themselves obscene or offensive, were taken from her Facebook and Instagram accounts without her consent, and were uploaded on a pornographic website with derogatory captions added to them.

Justice Bhambhani noted, “The true enormity of this fact has dawned over the course of hearings conducted in the present matter, when it transpired that despite orders of this court, even the respondents (Internet service provider, search engines), who were willing to comply with directions issued to remove offending content from the world wide web, expressed their inability to fully and effectively remove it.”

The judge remarked that, “Errant parties merrily continued to re-post and re-direct such content from one website to another and from one online platform to another, thereby cocking-a-snook at directions issued against them in pending legal proceedings.”

Google had during the hearing stated that it has no opposition to removing access to the offending content as may be directed by the court.

Facebook, which also owns the social media platform Instagram, submitted that it has a robust privacy policy and also adopts global best practices to protect the privacy of its users to permit a safe online experience. It pointed out that though it was the woman’s allegation that her photographs and images had been taken from her Facebook/Instagram social media accounts, she does not claim any relief against Facebook/Instagram.

The woman claimed she had already filed a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal as well as to the jurisdictional police but to no avail. She claimed that the photographs had received some 15,000 views within a week of being posted.

Noting that a solution to the problem needed to be crafted so that legal proceedings of the nature faced by the court did turn futile, Justice Bhambhani said that for an order directing the removal or access disablement of offending content to be effective even within India, a search engine had to block the search results throughout the world.

“Even if, given the nature of the Internet, offending content cannot be completely ‘removed’ from the world wide web, offending content can be made unavailable and inaccessible by making such content ‘non-searchable’ by de-indexing and de-referencing it from the search results of the most widely used search engines, thereby serving the essential purpose of a court order almost completely,” the High Court said.","The Korea Tourism Organisation along with The Hindu will present an online discussion on ‘The rising Korean wave in India and how it will influence post-pandemic travel to South Korea’ on April 22 at 4 p.m.

Britain has ordered an investigation of NVIDIA’s $40 billion acquisition of Cambridge-based chip maker Arm on national security concerns.

Oliver Dowden, UK’s Digital Secretary, wrote to the country’s competition regulator, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), instructing them to begin a ‘phase one’ investigation of the deal announced in September.

“Following careful consideration of the proposed takeover of ARM, I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,” Dowden said in a statement.

CMA will have to submit an initial report to the Digital Secretary by July 30, 2021, covering potential national security issues along with competition and jurisdictional issues. Besides, the government will examine the national security public interests.

“We want to support our thriving UK tech industry and welcome foreign investment, but it is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,” Dowden said.

Once phase one investigation is completed, Dowden has a few options. He can clear the transaction and related subject to any agreed undertaking, or refer the transaction to a phase two investigation. However, there is no set time period before which the decision must be made.

If the deal is referred to a phase two investigation, the CMA will lead a further investigation of any identified competition and/or public interest concerns. CMA will then make recommendations to the Digital Secretary, advising remedy to any adverse effects.

At the end of a phase two investigation, the Digital Secretary can take action to remedy, mitigate or prevent any effects adverse to the public interest.

Based on the report, if the Digital Secretary thinks there are no public interest concerns, but there are competition concerns, he will instruct the CMA to deal with the merger as an ordinary merger case.","Apple said it had recently opened its iPhone's systems to third-party tag trackers in ways that meet Apple's privacy standards

(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)

Apple Inc on Tuesday announced the launch of attachable AirTags to help users track lost items, and the devices could become the focus of a rival company's challenge during a hearing before the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.

When attached to keys and other items, the tags communicate with Apple devices to help users find the items if lost. They compete with Tile, a startup company that has sold a similar device for more than a decade and has testified to U.S. lawmakers that Apple's privacy practices have put Tile's products at a disadvantage.

In a statement on Wednesday, Tile's Chief Executive CJ Prober said lawmakers should examine Apple's entry to the tracker tag product category at a U.S. Senate committee hearing where Tile will testify.

""We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition,"" Prober said. ""Unfortunately, given Apple’s well documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical.""

Apple said it had recently opened its iPhone's systems to third-party tag trackers in ways that meet Apple's privacy standards.

“We have worked from the very beginning of iPhone to help protect the privacy of users' location data, giving them transparency and control over how all apps may access and share their location,"" Apple said in a statement.

""We have always embraced competition as the best way to drive great experiences for our customers, and we have worked hard to build a platform in iOS that enables third-party developers to thrive.”

Tile will testify this week before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel headed by Senators Amy Klobuchar, the Democratic chair, and Mike Lee, its ranking Republican. The hearing will focus on competition concerns from developers who rely on Apple and Alphabet Inc-owned Google's app stores to reach consumers.

Apple and Google executives will testify as will executives from music streaming service Spotify Technology SA and dating service Match Group, both of which have criticized Apple's requirements to use its payments system and to pay commissions on sales from the App Store.

Tile's concerns have centered on Apple's privacy controls and restrictions and whether Tile has the same access to the iPhone's hardware and systems as Apple's own products.

In testimony last year, Tile said it had maintained a productive relationship with Apple, selling its products in Apple's stores, but that the relationship rapidly deteriorated in 2019 when Apple announced it would enhance its ""FindMy"" app to work more like Tile.

Tile testified that Apple hired away one of its engineers around that time and also tightened up its privacy controls by adding more steps before third-party developers could access a user's location data, which the Tile devices require to function. But to use Apple's FindMy system, third-party developers face limits on how much data they can collect on customers. Tile argued that the extra steps put its products at a disadvantage to Apple's own FindMy app.

In 2020, Apple began to open up the FindMy app to third-party developers. Last month, Apple opened the program, saying that it would release a chip blueprint that third parties could use to take advantage of the iPhone's hardware. Three companies have announced products that use Apple's new system, including electric bike maker VanMoof and Chipolo, which makes an item tracker similar to Tile's devices.

Tile has not said whether it plans to use Apple's program for third-party access to the FindMy app.","Apple also updated its Apple TV set top box with better colour output and a faster processor chip.

Apple Inc announced AirTags to find lost items and podcast subscription services that will compete with rival Spotify and also introduced an array of slim iMac computers in a variety of colours.

AirTags will cost $29 each or four for $99 and will be available starting 8 a.m. ET (1200 GMT) on April 30. Podcast subscription prices will be set by creators and billed monthly,Apple said. Apple will charge creators $19.99 per year for its podcast programme.

Apple introduced a thinner version of its iMac computer that uses its house-designed central processor unit and comes in several new colours.

Apple also updated its Apple TV set top box with better colour output and a faster processor chip. The new Apple TV 4Kwill also let users improve a TV’s picture by using light sensors on the iPhone.

Apple said that spouses and partners would be able to share and merge credit lines with its Apple Card, which CEO Tim Cook described as an important step toward making it easier forpeople to build their credit scores.

Apple shares have risen nearly 95% over the past year,faster than the 63% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index,thanks to a record $274.5 billion in sales for fiscal 2020 as consumers stocked up on electronics during the pandemic. Apple shares were down 1%.

Macs and iPads accounted for $52.3 billion during its fiscal 2020.

“The Pro iPads are not the volume sellers, but they blur thel ine between Mac and iPad. How Apple differentiates between the iPad Pro and the Mac will be very interesting to watch,” Ben Bajarin, principal analyst for consumer market intelligence at Creative Strategies.

The AirTag announcement could result in a new round of complaints to lawmakers that Apple is hurting smaller rivals.Tile, a startup that has sold a competing tracker for nearly a decade, last year testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that Apple’s App Store rules had made it harder to use Tile’s products and will be called before the U.S. Senate to testify on Wednesday.

Apple has said it subjects all apps, including its own, to the same App Store review rules.

Bob O’Donnell, head of TECHnalysis Research, said he does not believe the trackers will become a big business on their own. “Because they are so late to this, it might not be that much different than when Apple got into set top boxes like AppleTV. They’re a player. They’re there, but they’re not huge,” he said.

But Bajarin said the trackers could keep people tied to their iPhones if they rely on them to find items like keys and wallets.

“The more you buy into just one hardware product, the less likely it is you’ll ever leave,” Bajarin said.","Check out the Open web is an important part of the internet of tomorrow. (File, Representational)

Written by Shivam Srivastava

When a friend wanted to build an online music tutoring service and called me for his advice on how he could market, the obvious areas we discussed were social and digital media. He asked me a few very pertinent questions and left me wondering why these questions are not asked more frequently. Or perhaps we don’t know how to ask the right questions?

For instance, he asked me why was everyone advising him to spend money and build content only to post it on a third-party social media when he is already spending money to build his own digital asset?

For any new business or brand starting up, there are two things that take centre stage. One, the product itself and two, a web asset to market the product. What follows after is a bewildering journey to generate traffic and leads to build revenue, spending those hard-earned savings that one had set aside to build his business.

Businesses and professionals are really spending their hard-earned money to build content for aggregators like Facebook and Instagram. Walled gardens and big tech like these are driving their user growth based on creators and businesses like these who are building content to drive engagement. To make matters worse, on platforms like Facebook, one does not even have first-hand and verified information about the users who have consumed the content.

What if, just like my friend suggested, we could build our own followers on our own platforms. It is possible. Let’s look a little deeper.

What does social media do?

Globally 70% of content consumed on social media are in stories format. Stories are short video content in a vertical format that gives you a full-screen experience on your smartphone. Given the fact that India is a mobile-first country, this format’s popularity has leapfrogged over the last few years and validates the growth of platforms like Instagram, Tik Tok and so on.

With this insight into the content consumption trend, wouldn’t it be wise to consider building such content for your own web asset, upgrade from text and image-based websites to one that can offer an immersive, engaging experience that is in line with the consumption trend?

The next big thing

There is no doubt that, in a mobile-first country like India where a majority of the content consumed is on mobile, video is really deriving significant engagement over the last couple of years. But the real shift will be driven by the demand for vertical video, ideally full screen. Now let’s slap on “Stories” format content with vertical video and you have a winner at hand. Let’s elaborate on this.

We all know that be it Linkedin, Facebook, Twitter or Insta, all have integrated “Stories” within their environment. Now imagine “Stories” on your website, offering a seamless, app like tap-able, Swipe-able experience on mobile. With this, you can offer the same user experience of the app to your followers, keep your own followers on your website, rather than offering them to the big tech.

The decentralised ecosystem

The decentralised ecosystem is not a dream anymore, it’s a reality and the world over there is a call for an ecosystem that encourages privacy. One that does not give away control of the web to a handful, rather make the web a democratic place for users to consume and share information and content.

The Open Web, which is an ecosystem that every independent website is a part of, has close to 350 million websites that get 250 billion visits month on month. The leading apps, however, garner only about 20 billion users, but still manage to grab our attention with the user experience they offer. Now, with a better user experience, there is a potential for a unified open web to take on the big tech and make the web the democratic space that it should be.

What is in it for independent creators, businesses and users?

Open Web encompasses democratic concepts like free expression and digital inclusion. There’s a single underlying principle connecting all these ideas: An open web is a web, by and for all its users, not select gatekeepers or governments. Much like other public resources like water or air.

The web cannot exist without society. The web is where we engage with journalism, form opinions and share knowledge. It’s an arena for politics, education, culture and science and business. An open web will encourage us to be more informed; encourage civic participation; more opportunities to learn and connect with each other. It discourages misinformation and ensures we do not lose trust in our institutions and in each other.

For businesses and creators, the open web promises first-party data instead of third-party data that is usually handed out on social media. In addition, you finally will have your own followers, instead of sharing them with the social aggregators. More importantly, your monetisation strategy only benefits you, rather than the big tech that takes the lion’s share of your revenues

When closed, proprietary technology proliferates, innovation and competition are stifled. The web no longer remains a level playing field — it’s a platform controlled by a select few.

The writer is vice-president, monetisation at Firework India","The under-display camera has been one of the most talked-about design elements in the past couple of years for smartphones. While a few brands like ZTE have actually pulled off the disappearing front camera design on their flagship phones, the technology is still far from perfect in a commercially available device.

However, a new report states that this could change in 2021. Twitter tipster Ice Universe has suggested that Samsung could be soon bringing the under-display camera to a Folding-smartphone in the near future. Check out the tweet below.

The second half of the year is when the Under Display Camera officially debuts, including at least Samsung (folding), Xiaomi (MIX4), OPPO (folding), vivo and ZTE (greatly improved version) — Ice universe (@UniverseIce) April 19, 2021

The tweet further adds that a few other major brands will also be jumping on the under-display camera bandwagon this year. These include Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. The tweet also suggests that ZTE will also be improving the under-display front camera that it launched with the ZTE Axon 20 last year.

Why are brands looking at under-display cameras?

The race to increase screen real estate and a more uniform and symmetric design has been going on between Android phones for years now. The days of the big fat notch are behind us and various implementations to make the screen more immersive have taken over.

This started with curved corners on screens and was followed by the biz bezels turning into smaller, semi-curved rectangular notches. This later evolved to a smaller waterdrop notch that included just the camera and sensors in a smaller black part on the screen.

It was when brands figured out how to engineer the speakers and other sensors on the top edge of the phone that phones moved to the punch-hole and pill-shaped camera setups that we know today. While some brands like OnePlus also briefly took the pop-up front camera route, complications have led to these brands moving back to punch-hole cameras.

With the end goal being a completely bezel-less screen with no interruptions, the only way out left for brands was to bury the front camera below the screen, allowing it to show itself and function only when needed. This is what we call the under-display camera.

Apple expected to bring under-display cameras in 2022

With Android manufacturers adopting the new technology, Apple’s iPhones too are soon expected to implement under-display cameras. While the notch (in a smaller avatar) is expected to stick around for another year with the Apple iPhone 13 series, a Softpedia report suggests that the 2022 iPhone could get rid of the notch totally.","The new Apple iPad Pro is the most powerful iPad yet. Here's why. (Image Source: Apple)

The new Apple iPad Pro, alongside the new iMac, was one of the highlights of the Apple Spring Loaded event, and for good reason. The new powerful ‘Pro’ tablet from Apple improves on its predecessors by including the M1 chip that powers Apple’s laptops and Mac Mini, as well as other new specifications like a new Mini-LED screen, Thunderbolt support and more. Here’s all you need to know about the new iPad Pro 2021.

iPad Pro 2021: Features and Specifications

With the M1 chipset, Apple claims it has bumped up the performance on the new iPad Pro by up to 50 per cent than the last iPad Pro and the GPU is claimed to be 40 per cent faster. The tablet can now also be coupled with up to 16GB RAM and up to 2TB internal storage, which again is expected to be twice as fast as before.

Apple has been improving the iPad Pro to bring it closer to laptops and on that line, the brand has now brought a Thunderbolt USB-C port to the new iPad Pro. The tablet hence now has a transfer speed of 40Gbps and allows users to connect fast external storage external and display monitors of up to 6K resolution.

The new iPad Pros also get 5G connectivity and in the US, this includes support for mmWave 5G. This allows speeds of up to 4Gbps on the iPad Pro under ideal conditions. There’s also eSIM support.

12.9-inch iPad Pro gets Mini-LED screen, both variants get ProMotion display

The iPad Pro is still available in two sizes, an 11-inch variant and a larger 12.9-inch variant. While the smaller iPad sticks to an LCD display, the larger 12.9-inch iPad now gets a Mini-LED display panel (that Apple calls the Liquid Retina XDR display). Check out more on Mini-LEDs below.

The new backlight on the panel now features 10,000 tiny LEDs grouped into 2,500 local dimming zones. This panel allows the iPad Pro to show better contrast ratios and peaking at 1,600 nits of brightness. The tablet now also supports all HQ imaging formats including HDR10, Dolby Vision and HLG.

The 11-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch variant both get Apple’s 120Hz ProMotion display tech that allows adaptive refresh rate switching on the screen. Check out more on how that works in our detailed copy below.

New TrueDepth Camera and Apple’s ‘Center-Stage’ feature

Both the iPad Pro variants get a new 12MP TrueDepth camera on the front with a new 122-degree ultra-wide-angle lens. The large field of view allows the new iPad Pro to make use of a new feature called Center Stage that could be really handy.

The iPad can now zoom in to the users’ position during a video call and uses Machine Learning algorithms to track the user in real-time. This lets the camera view ‘follow’ the user in case he/she moves from the original position during the video call, as long as the user is in the field of view of the new ultra-wide camera lens.

Further, the feature also intelligently accommodates a second user should someone enter the frame during the call and will automatically pan to a position from where both subjects are in the frame.

On the back, there is still a dual camera with a 12MP main sensor and a 10MP ultra-wide-angle sensor. There is also a LiDAR scanner. The setup is now capable of Smart HDR 3 and can auto-focus better in low light thanks to the scanner. The LiDAR scanner also lets users insert animations and digital imagery into their photos and videos to create mixed-reality-like photos and videos.

(Image Source: The Indian Express/ Nandagopal Rajan)

The Amazon Fire TV Stick has over the years taken smart features to millions of televisions across the world at a very affordable price point. Now, Amazon wants to push the game and offer more from its Fire TV stables with a premium new offering called the Fire TV Cube.

So what is the Fire TV Cube?

The Fire TV Cube does what the Fire TV Stick does, but adds a handsfree experience, better connectivity and more processing power. It has the shape of a cube and can connect with the TV via an HDMI cable, which you will have to buy extra if there is none lying around in your house.

The big difference is that Fire TV Cube is an Alexa device on its own and it can reply to queries, as well as control the TV and other devices connected to it. The Fire TV Cube comes with a converter that lets it connect directly to the internet using an ethernet cable — connectivity is at times a problem on Echo devices when you are syncing audio from a TV to a different speaker — and an IR Extender cable to control other, not so smart, devices.

Fire TV Cube: What is good?

With the Fire TV Stick, you could use press the Mic button on top and use voice commands to search for content or just ask stuff to Alexa. However, this worked only when the stick was on.

Now, with the Fire TV Cube, you can walk into a room, ask Alexa to switch on the TV and then play Young Sheldon from Amazon Prime. Works like a breeze and if the episode that’s played is one you have watched, you can ask Alexa to change the episode or just switch the TV back off. All without even figuring out where you left the remote last.

Interestingly, while the Fire TV Cube can be operated fully hands-free, it has a better remote than the Fire TV Stick. The new remote has replaced the Mic button with an Alexa one and has dedicated buttons for Prime Video, Netflix, Amazon Music and all apps. There is a forward and reverse button which earlier had to be something you had to manage with the ring and select buttons.

The Amazon Fire TV Cube is an Alexa-enabled device and can reply to queries. (Image Source: The Amazon Fire TV Cube is an Alexa-enabled device and can reply to queries. (Image Source: The Indian Express / Nandagopal Rajan)

The Fire TV Cube has a processor that plays 4K content in Dolby Vision HDR10+ at up to 60 frames per second and with Dolby Atmos, provided you are not stuck with Full HD TVs like me. On a Full HD TV, I could no make out a huge difference in video quality to the earlier generation Fire TV Stick. There are no audio ports on the Cube, so you will connect to a soundbar if needed via Bluetooth.

One good thing about the Fire TV Cube is that is a full-fledged Alexa device and does everything any other echo device will do. So if you ask a query it gives an answer and even throws the text result on the screen for good measure. If you request a song it plays on the TV as the Cube does not have a great speaker. You can connect other Alexa enabled devices to this one and control like you would an Echo. In fact, look at this as the Echo for the house, but connected to a TV and a speaker for better audio quality.

Fire TV Cube: What is not that good?

The Fire TV Cube has a pricing that is three times more than that of the Fire TV Stick, so buy this only if you have high-end televisions at home and pay extra for the Netflix 4K streaming. This is not a replacement for your Fire TV Stick.

Fire TV Cube: Should you buy?

Yes, but only if you have high end 4K televisions at home and maybe you have not yet invested in an Alexa device. For such users this is a great product that can become your smart entertainment hub, connecting and controlling much more than your TV. Others can stick to the Fire TV Stick which is best smart options for content consumption.","Here's all you need to know about the new Apple TV including price, specifications and more. (Image Source: Apple)

Apple announced the sixth generation of the Apple TV streaming box at the April 20 Spring Loaded event. The new Apple TV comes equipped with a more powerful chipset inside, along with an all-new remote and other features like smart colour calibration. Here’s all you need to know about the new Apple TV and the remote.

Apple TV 4K: Specifications

The new Apple TV 4K is powered by an Apple A12 Bionic chipset. In case that sounds familiar, that is the same custom-made Apple chip that powered Apple phones in the past like the iPhone XS and iPhone XR. The new Apple TV features a six-core design with two high performance and four power-efficient CPU cores along with a quad-core GPU.

The new specifications allow the Apple TV 4K to play HDR videos of up to 4K resolution at 60fps. Further, users can now also stream content directly from the iPhone 12 directly to the Apple TV 4K via AirPlay. Apple has also announced its partnership with FOX Sports, NBCUniversal, Paramount+, Red Bull TV and Canal+ to support HDR content at high frame rates on the new Apple TV 4K.

All about that new remote

Another highlight of the new Apple TV 4K is a new Siri remote controller. Unlike the last-gen Apple TV remote, the new one features a revamped design, that makes it easy to use in the dark. Instead of the flat touchpad in the middle, users will now find a circular direction pad that features five-way physical controls.

The new remote moves the Siri button to the side. (Image Source: Apple) The new remote moves the Siri button to the side. (Image Source: Apple)

The touch-sensitive surface of the direction pad also lets users swipe on it to navigate through the Apple TV 4K UI (user interface). Running their fingers around the circular ring, users will also be able to scrub through the content they are watching, similar to the experience of the older iPods. Additionally, the new remote also gets a dedicated mute and power button, while the Siri button has been moved to the side of the remote now.

The Apple TV 4K also gets a new colour calibration feature that will beneficial for those in the Apple ecosystem. iPhone users will be able to hold up their phones in front of the Apple TV to colour calibrate it, making use of the phone’s sensors to colour calibrate the screen to an extent. However, this will not deliver results as good as a professionally calibrated screen.

Pricing and availability

The new Apple TV 4K will be available starting at Rs 18,900 from the Apple website, a nearby Apple Store or the Apple Store app. Apple TV 4K is also available through Apple Authorised Resellers and select pay-TV providers. Customers can order the new Apple TV 4K beginning Friday, April 30, with availability beginning in the second half of May in more than 30 countries and regions, including the US.

The new Siri Remote will be available separately for Rs 5,800 and will be compatible with the previous-generation Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD. For the first time, AppleCare+ will be available for Apple TV, providing three years of technical support and additional hardware coverage, including up to two incidents of accidental damage protection every 12 months","Amidst all the colour and glitz of Apple’s Spring Loaded event, one announcement went under the radar.

and they come pre-loaded with iOS 14.5. The purple colour variant goes on sale on April 30. Also, in one of the many footnotes in the press release for AirTag, Apple has clearly mentioned that iOS 14.5 is coming next week. “AirTag requires iPhone or iPod touch running iOS 14.5 or later, or iPad running iPadOS 14.5 or later. These software updates will be available starting next week,” reads the footnote.

Why is iOS 14.5 important for iPhone users?

App Tracking Transparency. Yes, the big feature that has got Facebook massively upset whereas some slightly upset is set to roll out with iOS 14.5 Apps will not be able to track any user data without having permission. “With the upcoming public release of iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and tvOS 14.5, all apps must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to request the user’s permission to track them or to access their device's advertising identifier. Unless you receive permission from the user to enable tracking, the device's advertising identifier value will be all zeros and you may not track them,” Apple said in a blog post.

App developers have time till April 26 — another hint that update will arrive on April 27 — to update their apps with the new feature. Apple has said that it will take strict action against those who don’t comply with the new frame.

Top Comment","Most Android brands are slowly ditching the microSD card slot and forcing buyers to opt for higher memory variants. Another issue with Android smartphones is that apps are becoming larger and dumping more junk files on devices, further straining the limited internal memory.Now, Google is coming to the rescue of users and it will include a new feature in Android 12 to keep your device clean. The feature will be called ""app hibernation"" and will automatically detect apps that are less used and will put them in an ‘Unused apps’ section. It will also revoke all the permissions that were earlier granted to the app and will delete temporary files like cache, logs and others.Reports claim that any app that hasn’t been used within three months may be put in the ‘Unused apps’ section to free up storage space automatically. At the same time, Android 12 will not uninstall these apps totally. If you wish to use any of these apps again you can quickly do it by visiting enabling them again.Another notable change to help consume less memory is the introduction of HEVC support. Google is adding compatible media transcoding to support HEVC in Android 12. With this feature, an app that doesn’t support HEVC can have the platform automatically transcode the file into AVC. Also, for better image quality with more efficient compression, Android 12 will support AV1 Image File Format (AVIF). Google claims that this will dramatically improve image quality for the same file size when compared to older image formats like JPEG.As far as other features are concerned, With the Android 12 update, Google plans to add a revamp taskbar for only big-screen devices.

A WhatsApp group made up of film technicians, actors and film aspirants in Kerala called Vellithira (meaning silver screen) pooled in their resources and have made a short film titled Kaakka, which is now streaming on the OTT platform Nee Stream.

Formed in 2016, this WhatsApp group has 256 members and is as much a resource as it is a means of networking.

Before the pandemic outbreak, the members of Vellithira had been toying with the idea of producing a film. However, that plan fell through when the lockdown started. “We had no clue when and how theatres would open. That is when the short film idea came up and I pitched my story,” says the film’s director Aju Ajeesh.

“The film was made with the money we raised as donations — ranging from ₹500 to ₹30,000 — from our members. We raised close to ₹3 lakh; none of us (cast and crew) took any payment for the work. All the money was spent on accommodation, food and equipment,” Aju adds.

Initially, the plan was to make a feature film with the story of Kaakka, but the team of writers, including Aju, Gopika K Das and Shinoj Ennikkal, felt it was more suited as a short. “Everyone who has been a part of this project has worked in the film industry. Kaakka has been made like a feature film and for a theatrical release; we have not compromised on anything. We even used dental prosthetics for the lead character,” Aju adds.

Politics of colour

Kaakka pivots around Panchami, a woman who is not confident about her looks. “We did not just want to look at the politics of colour, we wanted to show her point of view... which is the result of her experiences of not looking like the conventional notion of ‘beautiful’. It is her perception of herself ,” says Aju.

He clarifies that though the film is called Kaakka (Crow), it is not a reference to Panchami’s complexion. Instead, it indicates how she sees herself as being invisible, similar to crows who — according to Panchami — also go unnoticed. She is not a victim, but a confident woman who hides her insecurities behind the facade of being quick-witted. For instance, she jokes that her father’s love of black tea resulted in him and her being dark complexioned.

The plot takes place amid the pandemic. Panchami complains that the money kept aside for her dental treatment was spent due to COVID-19 as it caused a dent in the family’s income. Her closing monologue is poignant. “The best part of the pandemic is that I can smile freely. This is the first time in my life that I have been able to do this. You see, nobody can see my teeth or my face under the mask and judge my looks or smile,” she says in the film.

A former wedding videographer, Aju has made three short films before — Bra (Malayalam), Psycho (Tamil) and a COVID-19-related short titled Kunnikuru (Malayalam). He sees Kaakka as his stepping stone to the Malayalam film industry.","It may have missed the Oscars, but 'The Disciple' is grabbing eyeballs for its universal theme that explores artistic ambition, legacy and acceptance

When Gravity released in 2013, the space-thriller made more than $700 million worldwide, and won seven Academy Awards, including one for Alfonso Cuarón as best director.

The Mexican filmmaker could have literally made anything he wanted at that point — big-budget Hollywood studios and stars were lining up to work with him. Instead, he went back to his neighbourhood in Mexico city where he’d grown up, and made a personal period piece called Roma that released to universal acclaim and ended up winning him another best director Oscar in 2018.

As the whole world waited with bated breath to see what he would do next (Harry Potter fans still celebrate him fondly for making Prisoner of Azkaban, the finest movie in the series), he announced that he would executive produce a little known Marathi project, helmed by Court director Chaitanya Tamhane. And from thereon, The Disciple began its award-studded journey.

Set in contemporary Mumbai, The Disciple is a deeply meditative film that follows the life of musician Sharad Nerulkar, essayed by Aditya Modak. Nerulkar has dedicated his life to becoming an Indian classical music vocalist, determined to live up to the expectations of his guru and his father. But as the years roll by, a disillusioned Nerulkar questions his life’s purpose and ponders: will he ever achieve the success he is in pursuit of?

“The film deals with an artistic ambition that is very specific, but the theme is highly universal,” says Cuarón. “It is about fathers and sons, about legacy, about the old world versus the new, how things change and how we adapt to it, how much we can accept ourselves, or how we have to follow the expectations of our parents. It is something that has really touched the core of audiences around the world.”

The winner of the Best Screenplay award at the 77th Venice International Film Festival, it also has producer Vivek Gomber (who starred in 2018’s critically-acclaimed film, Sir) on board, and is set to première in India this month.

Cuarón and Tamhane first met through the Rolex Mentor & Protégé Arts Initiative for 2016-17, and the former was so impressed with the young Indian talent that he offered to back his next film. Four years on, the two are good friends and their mutual respect comes across in every interview they do together.

On a Zoom call with The Hindu Weekend, Tamhane is still noticeably awed at his collaboration with the Mexican icon (he says so in as many words), while Cuarón is his usual Zen self, doling out nuggets of filmmaking wisdom, and full of praise for his Indian counterpart.

The duo talks to us about why the film has struck a chord with global audiences, how such international collaborations can drive Indian cinema forward, and how the pandemic has influenced their filmmaking.

(The interview has been edited and condensed.)

The film is set in the backdrop of Indian classical music, and yet international audiences and critics have been able to resonate with it...

Tamhane: I don’t think you can calculate or anticipate an audience’s reaction to anything. You create something with a certain intent and conviction because you believe in a story and its need to be told. Even before Court or The Disciple released, I had no idea how an international audience would react. We are talking about over 195-200 countries… it’s an abstract entity in that sense. I believe that the film and its themes — which talk about human aspiration, the personal quest for excellence and belonging to a certain tribe — are universal enough. Maybe if done with sincerity, some of it communicates and translates to viewers worldwide, transcending the barriers of geography and cultures.

In India, I feel a lot more confident that the film will resonate with people because it is an Indian story. The cultural specificities are what make it unique and original, and there are so many nuances, so many different undertones that an audience here will appreciate.

Cuarón: He’s been extremely humble about the perception of the film globally. The response to The Disciple has been amazing from the get go, right from when it premièred in Venice. And the word-of-mouth and reviews have been fantastic. Then came all these invitations, and it played at the New York Film Festival. This is Chaitanya’s second film. You know, I had to wait a decade or two for one of my films to be invited by the NYFF. Not only that, suddenly he starts getting these calls from Hollywood agents, actors and stars just embracing the film. There were already a bunch of people campaigning for the film to be in the Oscars, and disappointed that at the end, it was not the Indian selection even after so much support.

One of the biggest motifs in your (Cuarón's) films is the relationship between the subjects and their surroundings. In The Disciple, the city of Mumbai is almost a character. Is that due to your influence, Mr Cuarón?

Cuarón: I agree with you, and I love that about the film, that Mumbai is really a character in it. But it is a Mumbai that is completely grounded; there is no romanticisation or judgement about the city. Ultimately, what I perceived from Chaitanya is an immense love for his city. I wish I could say I had any influence over him, but his mind is so stubborn! I don’t think anyone can influence him [laughs].

Tamhane: I have absolutely been influenced by him while being on the sets of Roma, and seeing the post-production work. Yes, I had certain inclinations, but Alfonso really gave me the courage to be even more fearless to push myself. For instance, like in many of his [Cuarón] earlier works, we used only one or two lenses throughout the entire film.

Could your film set a precedent for other local talent to collaborate with foreign filmmakers?

Tamhane: To be very honest, I sometimes have to pinch myself that this is actually happening, even the fact that Alfonso is right now with us, supporting The Disciple. I think of this as a combination of wild luck, a matter of extreme privilege, and a lot of stars aligning.

I am nobody to comment on this, but yes, I do hope it does become a precedent of some sort. A filmmaker of his stature, supporting an Indian film like this… I don’t take it for granted at all. It’s really something fantastical and a dream come true.

Cuarón: Yes Chaitanya, because I watched the stars, not your film. I watched how they were aligned, and they really wanted your film [grins].

The central protagonist’s frustration and insecurity is an emotion that has been dominant in many of us during the pandemic; do you think the film resonates that sense?

Tamhane: What all of us are doing in this pandemic is adapting to the situations in front of us, and that’s kind of what the character is doing. It’s not a period of a year or two, it’s his entire life. I hope that this pandemic has given people time to sit back, switch off a little bit, and make them more receptive to a film that is meditative in its nature.

A still from ‘The Disciple’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

From the year we’ve had — and the one that we are experiencing now — how do you think you’ve changed?

Tamhane: We were very lucky that The Disciple had finished and it also had its première during the lockdown. But, the pandemic definitely has had an effect on me, and not in a positive way. I felt like, ‘okay, why should you do anything?’ That was a phase, but I snapped out of it and I’m now working on a new project. But I’ve been very envious of people who are productive and doing lots of things in the lockdown... like Alfonso, from what I’ve gathered.

Cuarón: You ride with it, and at the end, the extraordinary thing is that artists are always consciously and unconsciously influenced by their times. In my lifetime, there has never been a period so peculiar as this; it’s impossible for that not to affect us in ways we don’t comprehend now. But maybe those thoughts are going to start projecting in five years from now... when even if you do films without masks, and the whole thing is a little bit forgotten, there’s something that remains about this.

I was lucky as I had the luxury to keep working at home, and what I discovered is the joy of writing all over again. Before the pandemic, writing was just a means to make my film, and I was impatient with it. Now, with all the time available, it was just writing for pleasure, and that was actually sweet.

The Disciple premières on April 30 on Netflix","Madonne Ashwin’s recently-released Tamil political satire is in the spotlight for all the right reasons

Congratulatory messages have been pouring in for Madonne Ashwin, director of Tamil political satire Mandela. “Everyone is talking about the film, which shows that it has made an impact,” says Madonne. Mandela premièred on TV earlier this month and is currently streaming on Netflix. Though Madonne was initially disappointed about his debut film not having a theatrical release, the reception it is receiving has more than made up for it. “People who watched it on OTT have kept discussing it on social media. The reception and love has been organic.”

Mandela, a political satire set in a village divided by two prominent caste groups led by two brothers, holds a mirror to what plays out in Tamil Nadu during the time of elections. A hair-dresser, played by Yogi Babu, becomes a game-changer in the scheme of things in the film. “Though the premise is political, we were very particular that the storytelling should be light-hearted and yet make you ponder. I just had to look around at all the political events happening around me to spot situations for the film,” laughs Madonne, whose clever writing has won praise.

Madonne, who has made seven short films till date, fleshed out one of his popular shorts titled Ward Enn 325 into Mandela.“ I wrote 20 drafts before locking the script and screenplay. When I narrated the story to Yogi Babu, he liked it as he was also looking for a change too. Mandela matched his vision.”

Madonne says though filming a small-budget film comes with a lot of challenges,there are enough opportunities for learning. “ We had to to wrap up the film in 40 days. So, we had the storyboard of every single scene in place to ensure that the shoot went like clockwork. We shot at a village called Puliayankulam in Tirunelveli (where Pariyerum Perumal was also filmed).”

The director is all praise for Yogi Babu’s performance. Talking about the film ending, Madonne says he wanted to show three things — the hair-dresser gaining self-respect, the entire village coming together for him and the voting process. “To bring all these aspects together organically was the most difficult part.”

Though filmmakers like Gautam Menon and Balaji Sakthivel and actors like Sivakarthikeyan congratulated him, there’s one call he treasures the most: from acclaimed Tamil director Bharathiraja. “He was so moved by the film that he spoke to me for 15 minutes and in detail. I will value that call.”","Actor says the film will strike a chord with the audience and will hopefully change the conservative mindset of people with regards to beauty

Ileana D’Cruz says her upcoming film “Unfair & Lovely”, which deals with the obsession with fair skin in the country, is a beautifully written story that deals with the issue in a sensitive manner.

Set in Haryana, the film, also starring Randeep Hooda, chronicles the story of a dusky woman who faces social prejudice and how she deals with it.

The film marks the directorial debut of Balwinder Singh Janjua, who has served as a screenplay writer on films like Taapsee Pannu-Bhumi Pednekar-starrer “Saand Ki Aankh”, “Mubarakan” starring Anil Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor.

In the film, D’Cruz plays the titular role of Lovely and she says the film will strike a chord with the audience and will hopefully change the conservative mindset of people with regards to beauty.

“This story is beautifully written. It is not overtly in your face preachy. It is an entertaining fun story that touches upon a very sensitive topic. It gives you the most human perspective to it. People will relate to it and it will also open up their mind a little more and not be narrow-minded when it comes to color in this country,” D’Cruz said.

The 33-year-old actor finds the obsession with fair skin bizarre.

“Colour doesn’t define beauty. It is like saying, the sky is not beautiful at night but it is as you get to see stars,” she added.

Backed by Sony Pictures Films India in association with Movie Tunnel Productions, “Unfair & Lovely” is slated to release this year.

Asked whether the film industry sets fuels society’s obsession for a certain standard of beauty, D’Cruz said Bollywood had all sorts of women who are equally “loved and are successful”.

“With this story, I take pride that we have different and unconventional-looking women in our industry. We have all sorts of women in Bollywood who are equally loved and are successful. There is this obsession not in the film industry but more so in the country. I don’t know if the film industry has to be blamed for it because we idolise women,” she added.

D’Cruz recently featured in “The Big Bull” where she played the role of a journalist, Meera Rao.","A video interview with the director and lead actors of 'Geeli Pucchi' and 'Khilauna', two shorts part of Netflix's 'Ajeeb Dastaans.'

Jane Austen’s heroine Anne Elliot is taking a chance on love again in cinema with “Fifty Shades of Gray” star Dakota Johnson all set to play the character from “Persuasion” in a Netflix adaptation.

Acclaimed theatre director Carrie Cracknell will make her feature directorial debut with the movie with Ron Bass and Alice Victoria Winslow set to adapt the novel for new age audiences, the streamer announced on Tuesday.

Cracknell last directed Jake Gyllenhall and Tom Sturridge in “Sea Wall/ A Life” on Broadway.

Johnson recently starred in the drama “Our Friend”, and will next be seen in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Lost Daughter” and Stephanie Allynne and Tig Notaro’s “Am I Ok?”.

Netflix said the latest adaptation takes a modern, witty approach to a beloved story while still remaining true to Jane Austen’s classic novel.

Living with her snobby family on the brink of bankruptcy, Anne Elliot is an unconforming woman with modern sensibilities. When Frederick Wentworth—the dashing one she once sent away—crashes back into her life, Anne must choose between putting the past behind her or listening to her heart when it comes to second chances, the film’s official logline reads.

“Persuasion” will be produced by Andrew Lazar, Christina Weiss Lurie with Elizabeth Cantillon Michael Constable and David Fliegel serving as executive producers.

“Persuasion” was published in 1817, six months after Austen’s death. It is considered Austen’s most mature work with a not so young heroine.

Speaking on this, Shariq Patel, CBO, Zee Studios shared, “The ongoing pandemic forced us to innovate, and we are proud to be the first to embark upon this new distribution strategy.

Netflix’s pandemic-fueled subscriber growth is slowing far faster than anticipated as people who have been cooped at home are able to get out and do other things again.

The video-streaming service added 4 million more worldwide subscribers from January through March, its smallest gain during that three-month period in four years.

Also Read | Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here

The performance reported Tuesday was about 2 million fewer subscribers than both management and analysts had predicted Netflix would add during the first quarter.

It marked a huge comedown from the same time last year when Netflix added nearly 16 million subscribers. That came just as governments around the world imposed lockdowns that created a huge captive audience for the leading video-streaming service.

Signaling that the trend is continuing, Netflix forecast an increase of just 1 million worldwide subscribers in the current April-June period, down from an increase of 10 million subscribers at the same time last year.

“It’s just a little wobbly right now,” Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings said during a discussion of the company’s results streamed Tuesday.

The poor showing to start the year rattled investors, causing the Los Gatos, California, company’s stock to drop by more than 8% in extended trading, even though Netflix’s revenue hit analyst targets and its profit exceeded estimates.

Netflix earned $1.71 billion, or $3.75 per share, more than doubling from a year ago. Revenue climbed 24% from the same time last year to $7.16 billion.

The inevitable slowdown in subscriber growth had been widely telegraphed by Netflix’s management in repeated reminders that its gains were a pandemic-driven anomaly.

Now that a large swath of the U.S. population has been vaccinated, people are able to move around more freely and are finding other diversions besides watching TV series and movies on Netflix.

“It all boils down to COVID,” Spencer Neumann, Netflix’s chief financial officer, said Tuesday.

The big question is how big this year’s decline will be from last year’s full-year increase of 37 million worldwide subscribers — by far the biggest since Netflix expanded its DVD-by-rental service into video streaming 14 years ago.

Third Bride analyst Scott Kessler speculated this year’s sluggish start may pressure Netflix management to make changes in its pricing or fine tune its strategy to help boost its growth from one quarter to the next. “Or will the company continue to focus on the longer term?” Kessler wondered.

Netflix management sought to reassure investors in a letter that predicted subscriber growth would improve during the second half of the year as more TV series and movies that had to be delayed during the pandemic are finished and released.

But what happened during the first quarter signals Netflix may be headed toward a lackluster year. The last time Netflix started a year with a lower gain — 5.3 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2017 — the service ended up with an annual increase of 21.6 million subscribers.

Netflix management doesn’t make annual growth projections, maintaining that it’s difficult enough to predict how many subscribers its service will add from one quarter to the next.

Besides no longer benefiting from people being stuck at home most of the time, Netflix is also facing more competition than ever from a wide range of video streaming services from major companies such as Disney, Apple and HBO.

Netflix, though, remains far ahead of the rest of the pack, with nearly 208 million worldwide subscribers. It also benefits from an award-winning lineup of shows that include still-popular series such as “Stranger Things,” “The Crown,” and “Ozark,” with more potential hits always brewing in a video factory that plans to spend $17 billion on programming this year alone.

Both Hastings and Neumann downplayed the impact of tougher competition in their comments Tuesday.

“There is this big runway of growth if we stay focused and keep getting better,” Neumann said.

A large portion of Netflix’s programming has been been financed by debt, but the company no longer expects to have to borrow to foot those bills. What’s more, Netflix is now bringing in more cash than it is burning, something it has rarely done in the best.

After posting a positive cash flow of $1.9 billion last year, Netflix expects to break even this year."

First, we curate the starters

Classic chickpea meets desi chilli hummus, thanks to Anoli Mavani, who makes 10 flavours of the popular spread. Try it with her pita bread, pita crisps and whole wheat crackers.

Explaining how she got hooked to it when she was in Dubai, Anoli, founder of The Hommus Family, says, “I experimented with many different flavours in hummus, and based on the feedback, I narrowed it down to the 10 best flavours.”

The Hommus Family now has Greek Melody (spinach and feta), Basilica (pesto) and Zesty Cilantro on the menu. Wheat crackers too are available in a variety of flavours including oregano, rosemary, thyme and pepper.

Anoli is currently working on her latest venture, The House of Kizo, focussing on desserts, cakes and cookies, using whole wheat and jaggery.

Then, we move to the mains

Kiran Thomas’ Raisin-chilli dip, a fragrant medley of pounded Kashmiri chilli, raisins, olive oil and jaggery, is a quick, easy way to jazz up dinner. “You will get the full impact of the flavour only when chillies are pounded in the ammikal (stone grinder),” she says.

Apart from this, her other bestseller is Adachetti, a traditional Kerala-style chutney made with small onions or shallots, tamarind, birds eye chilli (kandhari) and crystal salt. It is available on pre-order. “In our home, we add water to the sea salt crystals and use that for cooking the adachetti. The smoky flavour is from roasting the shallots and chillies in wood fire and then grinding it in the stone. Then, a little coconut oil is mixed in it and it is ready to serve. It goes well with plain rice,” says Kiran. She takes pre-order for set meals with customisable menu for up to 10 persons, offering Kerala-style fish pickles, fish moilee and chicken stew. @Kiran’s Goodies, ECR, delivers across the city, For order, call: 7823909095

Sharmilee Jayaprakash, a home chef, blogger and YouTuber (Sharmis Passions) from Coimbatore, pays tribute to the 1980s with a range of popsicles this summer. The ‘80s Classics, as she calls them, consists of rosemilk, vermicelli and paal (milk) ice flavours that defined the 1980s for her. “It was nostalgic for me to revive these flavours in a popsicle,” says Sharmilee.

Rose milk popsicle by Sharmilee Jayaprakash

For those of us who grew up in the 1980s, summer holidays were inextricably linked to ice lollies. The ubiquitous frozen sweet sticks that came in a multitude of flavours and left our tongues numb were the highlight of our childhood. Every street corner had a vendor who sold them in orange, grape, mango and milk flavours, not to mention the occasional chocolate.

The brightly-coloured, synthetic-flavour-laden “ice fruit” aka kuchi ice, kol ice and paal ice (kuchi and kol translate to stick) based on the region and flavour, is now better known as the popsicle. Now, home-made and containing actual fruits, these popsicles are trending again.

Vanilla guava and mango popsicle by Priya Kolassery

Priya Kolassery from Thiruvananthapuram, whose home-made popsicles have a number of buyers in the city, says she has seen people get sentimental over a popsicle. “I find they are more popular among older customers than kids,” she says.

Over five years now, there are few flavours she has not tried and shared on her YouTube channel Kolamass Kitchens. So far she has made them in vanilla, kulfi, seasonal fruits and even gooseberry.

“Ice pops are in demand through the year, but in summer, mangoes are the hot favourite. I use local mango varieties such as varikka or the Alphonso,” she says.

These home chefs keep the ingredients as simple and natural as possible, but keep the excitement up, by trying creative combinations. For instance: spices. Sharmilee’s most recent popsicle was made of paanagam, a traditional summer cooler, usually made during the Rama Navami festival. Containing pepper, jaggery water and a dash of lemon, she says paanagam worked wonderfully as a popsicle.

Dalgona coffee popsicle by Sharmilee Jayaprakash

“My kids never liked it, but loved it in the popsicle form. They even wanted the drink to be made more often,” adds Sharmilee, who also tried out a chikki (peanut candy) popsicle as per her son’s request.

“I used a milk base and the peanut candy gave just the right amount of crunch,” she says. During lockdown last year, she tried the dalgona popsicle as well. “The only ones I haven’t tried are rasam and sambar,” Sharmilee laughs.

Seasonal and fresh

Dhivya Jose, a YouTuber (Divs Passion Food) based in Dubai, prefers fresh fruits for summer. She adds chunks of fruit to a juice base and pours it into a mould. This is an ideal way to preserve fresh fruit for up to three months, says Dhivya.

Mini ice fruit pops by Dhivya Jose

“Watermelon sorbet popsicles, lemonade and tender coconut work well with chunks of real fruit,” says Divya. Sugar can be substituted with honey. This summer, Dhivya tried mini ice fruit popsicles, which were a hit among children. She used an ice tray for a mould and stuck a toothpick in each. “Even children who don’t like eating fresh fruits seem to love these,” says Dhivya, who encourages everyone to use locally-sourced, seasonal fruits for ice pops.

Unusual as it may sound, jackfruit too could make an excellent popsicle, says Priya.

She tried one with over-ripe, uncooked jackfruit, which came out surprisingly well. “We have so much jackfruit in summer. Why not make ice pops out of them?” she asks. Priya has also tried popsicles with dragon fruit, green grape and guava. The soursop, however, is her signature ice pop.

“Believed to have anti-cancer properties, soursop can be enjoyed as a popsicle and I get orders for it. It tastes slightly tangy, as I don’t add too much sugar,” says Priya. For diabetics, she has a gooseberry popsicle, which contains salt and birds eye chilli. “The green grape popsicle took time. I had to try several times to understand the consistency, when to remove from the mould and the like,” says Priya.

Vermicelli popsicles by Rose Mary George

Rose Mary George, a food blogger and YouTuber (Nish Kitchen) based in Australia, says frozen is a nice way to have semiya payasam. The Kerala staple payasam, also can be converted into a delicious popsicle. She uses roasted vermicelli and milk and adds a twist of vanilla to give it an edge. The semiya popsicle is an all-time favourite summer treat, she adds.

Making a popsicle at home is not rocket science, but it does involve trial and error to get that perfect one, says Sharmilee, who has had her share of flops.

“It comes with practice. Over time, you learn what flavours and products work well,” she says.

Fun moulds are available online, but even if you don’t have them, use plastic glasses, steel tumblers or thick paper cups, stick in ice cream sticks or even a small steel spoon and there, you have your own kuchi ice."
"Victoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also cancelled.

Australia on Wednesday cancelled four bilateral deals with China, Iran and Syria under new laws that give the federal government power to overrule international agreements by lower-level administrations that violate the national interest.

The cancelled deals include Victoria state's two “Belt and Road” infrastructure building initiative deals with Beijing signed in 2018 and 2019, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement. Those deals triggered the legislative response.

Victoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also cancelled.

“I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,” Payne said in a statement.

China had previously cautioned against disrupting “successful pragmatic cooperation” with Victoria.

Australia in 2018 passed sweeping national security laws that ban covert foreign interference in domestic politics. Beijing protested that the laws were prejudiced against China and poisoned Chinese-Australian relations.","The AstraZeneca vaccines were delivered to Idlib province through a border crossing with Turkey

Syria's last rebel-held enclave received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines on Wednesday, with a refrigerated truck offloading over 50,000 of United Nations-secured jabs in the overcrowded province.

The AstraZeneca vaccines were delivered to Idlib province through a border crossing with Turkey, the northwestern territory's only gateway to the outside world. Idlib health official Yasser Najib said jabs were provided through the U.N.-led COVAX programme for the world's poorest nations.

More vaccines were expected to arrive in government-controlled Damascus in the coming hours.

Given Syria's ongoing conflict, vaccine delivery is divided— the majority going through Damascus for government-held areas while the rest goes through the border with Turkey. The UN will go through Damascus to deliver over 200,000 jabs to cover government-held areas and Kurdish-dominated territory in the northeast.

The Idlib region, home to 4 million people, is seeing a new rise in infection rates. The area is home to over 2 million displaced persons who live in tent camps and temporary housing. While fighting has largely subsided, occasional military operations still violate a cease-fire that has been in place since March 2020.

After nearly recording no cases in the past month, infection has been on the rise in northwestern Syria portending a new surge, said Naser alMuhawish, who works in the labs monitoring cases in the area. Over 21,000 infection cases and over 640 deaths have been recorded in northwestern Syria.

In government areas, more than 21,000 infection cases and over 1,400 deaths have been recorded.

The World Health Organization had said the vaccination campaign in war-torn Syria was expected to start in April, and aims to inoculate 20% of the population by the end of 2021.

Najib, the Idlib health official, said the inoculation in northwestern Syria will begin early in May and use the 53,800 jabs to administer a first dose to doctors, nurses and frontline aid workers. It is unclear when the next batch would be delivered. The vaccines are stored in a warehouse in a border town.","The monarch said it has been ‘a comfort’ to ‘see and to hear all the tributes to my husband’ from within the U.K. and around the world.

Queen Elizabeth II has expressed her thanks for all the “support and kindness” shown following the death of her husband, Prince Philip.

In a statement on Wednesday posted on social media on her 95th birthday and which she personally signed off as Elizabeth R, the monarch said it has been “a comfort” to “see and to hear all the tributes to my husband"" from within the U.K., the Commonwealth and around the world.

“My family and I would like to thank you all for the support and kindness shown to us in recent days,” she said in her first remarks since Philip's funeral on Saturday.

“We have been deeply touched, and continue to be reminded that Philip had such an extraordinary impact on countless people throughout his life,” she added.

The Queen said she had received “many messages of good wishes” for her 95th birthday, which she “very much” appreciated.

She is marking her birthday in a low-key fashion at Windsor Castle. Some members of the royal family are expected to be with her on Wednesday. Her birthday falls within the two-week royal mourning period for Philip that is being observed until Friday.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was one of many people who sent best wishes to the monarch.

“I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth,"" Mr. Johnson said on Twitter. “I am proud to serve as her Prime Minister.”

Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, died on April 9 at age 99. Family and friends gathered for his funeral at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday to say their final farewells.

His death came a few months before his 100th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year, while the Queen’s 95th was always set to be a more low-key event.","The proposals are the 27-nation bloc's latest move to maintain its role as the world's standard-bearer for technology regulation

European Union officials unveiled proposals on Wednesday for reining in high-risk uses of artificial intelligence such as live facial scanning that could threaten people's safety or rights.

The draft regulations from the EU's executive commission include rules on the use of the rapidly expanding technology in activities such as choosing school, job or loan applicants. They also would ban artificial intelligence outright in a few situations, such as “social scoring” and systems used to manipulate human behaviour.

The proposals are the 27-nation bloc's latest move to maintain its role as the world's standard-bearer for technology regulation. EU officials say they are taking a “risk-based approach” as they try to balance the need to protect rights such as data privacy against the need to encourage innovation.

“With these landmark rules, the EU is spearheading the development of new global norms to make sure AI can be trusted,” Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's executive vice president for the digital age, said in a statement.

“By setting the standards, we can pave the way for to ethical technology worldwide and ensure that the EU remains competitive along the way.” The proposals also include a prohibition in principle on “remote biometric identification,” such as the use of live facial recognition on crowds of people in public places, with exceptions only for narrowly defined law enforcement purposes such as searching for a missing child or a wanted person.

The draft regulations say chatbots and deepfakes should be labelled so people know they are interacting with a machine.","Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto says the KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a training exercise on Wednesday when it missed a scheduled reporting call.

Russian President Vladimir Putin delivered his annual address to the nation on Wednesday amid a sweeping Kremlin crackdown on opposition protests and soaring tensions with the West.

Mr. Putin began his state-of-the-nation speech by hailing the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia’s technological and industrial potential.

The Russian leader has urged authorities to quicken the pace of the country’s vaccination programme, which has been slow compared to the West.

He promised new measures to encourage births and to increase average life expectancy, acknowledged that the pandemic has exacerbated demographic trends in Russia.

Mr. Putin proposed new incentives to help the economy overcome the blow from the pandemic and new social payments to the population.

Allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for nationwide protests across Russia on Wednesday to support him. Navalny started a prison hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he says is inadequate medical treatment for his back pains and officials’ refusal to allow a visit by his doctor. His deteriorating condition has caused international outrage.

Navalny’s imprisonment and his health condition have fueled tensions with the West, already strained over Moscow’s interference with elections, hacking attacks and, most recently, a massive Russian military buildup near the border with Ukraine.

The Kremlin has rejected Western concerns about the troop concentration, saying it’s free to deploy the military wherever it’s deemed necessary on the Russian territory.","Maximizing the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming months is critical for the White House.

The U.S. is set to meet President Joe Biden's latest vaccine goal of administering 200 million coronavirus shots in his first 100 days in office, as the White House steps up its efforts to inoculate the rest of the public.

With more than 50% of adults at least partially vaccinated, Mr. Biden on Wednesday will reflect on his efforts to expand vaccine distribution and access in his first three months in the White House. But with all those 16 and older now eligible for shots, the president is expected to outline his administration's plans to drive up the vaccination rate even further.

With roughly 28 million vaccine doses being delivered each week, demand has eclipsed supply as the constraining factor to vaccinations in much of the country. While surveys have shown that vaccine hesitancy has declined since the rollout of the shots, administration officials believe they have to make getting vaccinated easier and more appealing.

Maximizing the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming months is critical for the White House, which is aiming to restore a semblance of normalcy around the July Fourth holiday and even more so by the beginning of the next school year.

Mr. Biden was not expected to set new public targets for vaccinations, and administration officials have been careful to avoid predicting when the country will have vaccinated enough people to reach herd immunity. The U.S. is on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult by the end of May and for every American by July, but administering the shots will be another matter.

Also read | Biden administration denies ‘outright ban’ on vaccine raw materials

In recent weeks the White House has launched a massive outreach campaign to Americans to get vaccinated, relying on funding from the $1.9 trillion virus relief package passed last month to launch ads and fund direct community engagement to under-vaccinated constituencies.

Mr. Biden set his goal of 200 million shots last month after meeting his 100 million-in-100 days goal just over a month ago. At the time the U.S. was well on pace to meet the higher target, and the pace of vaccinations has only accelerated, to about 3 million shots per day.

The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the U.S. had even one authorized vaccine for COVID-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.

By the time Mr. Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the U.S. had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Mr. Biden’s goal was not ambitious enough. Mr. Biden quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.

It was a deliberate effort by Biden to set clear — and achievable — metrics for success as part of a strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration’s sometimes fanciful rhetoric on the virus.","The vessel was found to be carrying Uranium hexafluoride, which is classified under “dangerous cargo”.

Sri Lanka on Tuesday detected radioactive material on a China-bound vessel berthed at the southern Hambantota Port. The vessel has been asked to leave the Port, according to officials, as the shipping company failed to obtain prior clearance for “dangerous cargo”, as per Sri Lankan law.

When contacted, Sri Lankan Navy spokesman Captain Indika de Silva confirmed the development.

Officials said a local shipping company, handling the vessel sailing under the flag of Antigua and Barbuda, from Rotterdam in the Netherlands to China, cited a “mechanical emergency” and sought permission from the harbor manager at the China-run Hambantota Port. However, the company did not declare that the cargo was radioactive material, a requirement under Sri Lanka’s Atomic Energy Act.

The vessel was found to be carrying Uranium hexafluoride, which is classified under “dangerous cargo”, according to officials. “Uranium hexachloride is nuclear material that is commonly transported from one country to another. But as per Sri Lankan law, we need any vessel carrying radioactive material to obtain prior permission before berthing at any of our ports. This vessel had not obtained that clearance,” H.L. Anil Ranjith, Director General of Sri Lanka Atomic Energy Regulatory Council, told The Hindu on Wednesday. “After consulting the Ministry of Defence, we have asked the vessel to leave the Port,” he said.

Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition and the Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB or united people’s front) Sajith Premadasa raised the issue in Parliament on Wednesday. The Navy had not been allowed to “board the vessel to carry out an inspection”, he said, adding: “The government appears to be under pressure from a diplomatic mission.” He did not name the mission. “I am asking the government to examine this …this is a very serious matter, something that can affect the life of our community,” Mr. Premadasa said.","Russian authorities have stressed that the demonstrations were not authorised and warned against participating in them.

Two close associates of Alexei Navalny were detained on Wednesday ahead of protests planned to support the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, who has been on a hunger strike since March 31.

Navalny’s team called on Sunday for nationwide protests after reports about the politician’s health deteriorating in prison. Russian authorities have stressed that the demonstrations were not authorised and warned against participating in them.

Vladimir Voronin, a lawyer for top Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol, said on Twitter that people “in uniform” removed Sobol from a taxi near a Moscow metro station on Wednesday morning and took her to a police precinct.

Police also detained Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who is currently under house arrest on charges related to January protests in support of the politician. Yarmysh was detained near the entrance of her apartment building when she went out during the one hour she is allowed to leave, her lawyer, Veronika Polyakova, said on Twitter.

Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have rejected the accusation. His arrest for an alleged violation of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction triggered protests that represented the biggest show of defiance in Russia in recent years.

Soon after, a court ordered Navalny to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for the embezzlement conviction, which the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.” Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison officials’ refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.

Navalny’s physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said on Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys.

“Our patient could die at any moment,” he said in a Facebook post.

On Sunday, the politician was transferred to a hospital in another prison and given a glucose drip. Prison officials rebuffed attempts by his doctors to visit him there.

In response to the news about Navalny’s health, his team called for more nationwide protests on Wednesday, the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address.

According to a website dedicated to the protests, demonstrations were being planned in 165 Russian cities as of Wednesday morning.","The suicide bomber struck as an Afghan security convoy was passing.

A suicide bombing in the Afghan capital injured four people, the government said, hours before Turkey announced the delay of a conference at which it had been hoped Afghanistan’s warring sides would reach a peace pact to end decades of war.

Turkey announced the delay of the conference until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan and the Eid-al-Fitr holiday.

The suicide bomber struck as an Afghan security convoy was passing. The interior ministry's statement said civilians and security personnel were among the wounded. No one has taken immediate responsibility.

The attack was the first in weeks in the capital, even as targeted killings had escalated and Afghanistan's security personnel have come under relentless attacks by Taliban insurgents.

Residents fear the attack could be a harbinger of what's to come as the U.S. and NATO prepare to begin their final withdrawal from Afghanistan expected to be completed by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the deadly terrorist attacks in the United States. The attacks carried out by al Qaida were plotted from inside Afghanistan while the country was ruled by the hardline religious militia.","Twelve jurors found Derek Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter

Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer who pressed his knee against George Floyd’s neck, was handcuffed and taken into custody on Tuesday after being convicted of all three counts against him.

Twelve jurors found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, ultimately deciding that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death and that his actions were not that of a reasonable officer.

Prosecutors didn’t have to prove Chauvin’s restraint was the sole cause of Floyd’s death, only that his conduct was a “substantial causal factor.” They also had to prove his actions were unreasonable, because Chauvin was authorised to use force as a police officer, as long as that force would be considered reasonable by an objective officer.

Here’s a breakdown of the charges and what happens next:

What’s a second-degree unintentional murder?

It’s also called felony murder. To prove this count, prosecutors had to show that Chauvin killed Floyd while committing or trying to commit a felony — in this case, third-degree assault. They didn’t have to prove Chauvin intended to kill Floyd, only that he intended to apply unlawful force that caused bodily harm.

Prosecutors called several medical experts who testified that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because of the way he was restrained. A use of force expert also said it was unreasonable to hold Floyd in the prone position for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, handcuffed and face-down.

Defense attorney Eric Nelson tried to raise doubts about Floyd’s cause of death — saying underlying heart issues and drug use were to blame. He also argued that Chauvin’s actions were reasonable, saying Floyd was big, under the influence of something, could start fighting and that nearby bystanders presented a threat.

What about third-degree murder?

For this count, jurors had to find Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through an action that was “eminently dangerous” and carried out with a reckless disregard for and conscious indifference to the loss of life.

Mark Osler, a professor at University of St. Thomas School of Law, said prosecutors tried to prove this through testimony about the dangers of subduing a handcuffed person in the prone position. A medical expert testified about how the restraint would have killed a healthy person, and a police use-of-force trainer testified that officers are trained to avoid the neck when possible.

“They wanted to have a lot of evidence showing that what Chauvin did is not what he was trained to do and that the reason they don’t train people to do that is because it’s eminently dangerous,” Mr. Osler said.

And second-degree manslaughter?

Prosecutors had to show that Chauvin caused Floyd’s death through culpable negligence that created an unreasonable risk, and that he consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.

Testimony that revealed Chauvin should have known to put Floyd in a side recovery position, that he should have provided medical care before paramedics arrived and that he stayed in his position after he was told Floyd didn't have a pulse could all point to negligence, said former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger.

Where is Chauvin now?

Chauvin, who has been free on bail for the last several months, was handcuffed immediately after the verdicts were read and was taken into custody. A sheriff’s deputy escorted him out of the courtroom through an interior door.

The Minnesota Department of Corrections said on Tuesday night that he was at the State’s maximum security prison in Oak Park Heights, due to an arrangement with the county sheriff and the Department of Corrections. That’s the same prison where Chauvin was moved after his arrest for security reasons.

What sentence could he get?

Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. But Minnesota has sentencing guidelines that call for far less.

Under the guidelines, a person with no criminal history would receive a presumptive sentence of 12 1/2 years for each murder charge and a presumptive sentence of four years for manslaughter. The guidelines allow for a range slightly above and below those presumptive sentences, which is up to a judge’s discretion.

But in this case, prosecutors are seeking a sentence that goes above the guideline range, called an “upward departure.” They cited several aggravating factors, including that Floyd was particularly vulnerable, that Chauvin was a uniformed officer acting in a position of authority, and that his crime was witnessed by multiple children — including a 9-year-old girl who testified that watching the restraint made her “sad and kind of mad.”

After the verdicts, Attorney General Keith Ellison said his office would be seeking a “fair” and “just” sentence. He would not be specific, but said: “We believe there are aggravating factors and the sentence should exceed the sentencing guidelines.”

So what’s next?

Chauvin waived his right to have a jury consider whether there were aggravating factors that would call for an upward departure — leaving that decision in the hands of Judge Peter Cahill. Judge Cahill said he would give both sides a week to write legal briefs about aggravating factors, then he’ll take a week to issue findings on that issue.

Judge Cahill also ordered a pre-sentence investigation report, which is required in Minnesota and normally confidential. This report is typically prepared by a probation officer and includes information such as a defendant’s characteristics, circumstances, criminal record and social history. It also includes details of the offense and the harm it caused others and the community.

Judge Cahill said both sides will be able to respond to that report before he issues a sentence in two months. An exact date for sentencing has not been set.

Regardless of the final sentence, in Minnesota, defendants typically serve two-thirds of their penalty in prison, with the rest on parole.","New Zealand lowered its flags and held a national memorial service for Philip at the Wellington Cathedral of St. Paul.

Prince Philip was remembered in New Zealand on Wednesday as frank, engaging and willing to meet people from all walks of life during his 14 visits to the country.

New Zealand lowered its flags and held a national memorial service for Philip at the Wellington Cathedral of St. Paul, where Philip and Queen Elizabeth II had worshipped several times over the years on their visits to the country.

Philip died April 9 at the age of 99 and was mourned at a funeral service on Saturday at Windsor Castle. The New Zealand memorial happened to coincide with the queen’s 95th birthday.

Governor-General Patsy Reddy said Philip had travelled around New Zealand during his visits, meeting people from every culture and region. She said she could personally attest to his affection for the country.

“Prince Philip was a man of his time, but in many ways he was ahead of his time,” she said at the service. “At a time that it was very rare for a man to give up his career in support of his wife, Prince Philip relinquished his promising career in the Royal Navy to support the Queen.” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern read a psalm at the service, which was attended by several hundred mourners including Parliament Speaker Trevor Mallard.

In an interview outside the cathedral, Mr. Mallard said he had always been in favour of New Zealand becoming a republic and moving away from recognising Britain’s monarch as head of state.

“I think that at some stage we will make a change but my view is that could be some time off because our system, while it’s not that logical, is actually quite convenient,” Mr. Mallard said.

British High Commissioner to New Zealand Laura Clarke said in an interview that New Zealand was fortunate to be able to hold a full memorial service without coronavirus restrictions. She said it was extraordinary to think about the span that Philip’s life encompassed.

She said it was interesting to consider the nuances of how the royal system works.

“For me, I think about the British royal family, but of course this memorial is really about mourning Prince Philip as a member of the New Zealand royal family,” she said. “And of course that’s not always very well understood either in the U.K. or New Zealand.”","The EU commits itself on an intermediate target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030.

The European Union reached a tentative climate deal that should make the 27-nation bloc climate-neutral by 2050, with member states and parliament agreeing on the targets on the eve of a virtual summit that US President Biden will host.

“Our political commitment to becoming the first climate neutral continent by 2050 is now also a legal commitment. The Climate Law sets the EU on a green path for a generation,” said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen early Wednesday.

Under the provisional deal reached after officials negotiated through the night, the EU also commits itself on an intermediate target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

“It was high time for the agreement, as Europe has to show where it stands in view of the positive developments in the USA and China,” said MEP Peter Liese, the negotiator for the EPP Christian Democrat group.

Also read: US, China agree to cooperate on climate crisis with urgency

The United States, the world's second-biggest polluter after China, is preparing to announce its new target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

The deal still needs to be officially approved by the member states and the legislature, but Wednesday's agreement should make that little more than a rubber stamp.","“Unfortunately, it lurked in the population and hit back with a vengeance when our guard was down,” Indian civil servant Dr. Mrinalini Darswal said.

As India experiences a new wave of COVID-19 pandemic, an Indian public healthcare expert has called for adopting a “build, buy and jab” strategy for mass vaccination to handle the crisis along with the enforcement of appropriate behaviours and continuous communication from doctors, political leaders and administration.

“We are witnessing an awful resurgence of the pandemic in India, where it was perceived, just a few months back, to be essentially over. Unfortunately, it lurked in the population and hit back with a vengeance when our guard was down,” Indian civil servant Dr. Mrinalini Darswal, currently pursuing doctoral studies in public health with a focus on COVID-19 at Harvard University, told PTI.

It may be attributed in part to the pandemic fatigue in a population that relies on hard labour to earn a living and for whom waiting out the crisis over a prolonged period is not an option. However, the main reason seems to be the immune evading and highly infectious mutants, she said.

A 2002-batch Odisha-cadre IAS officer, Ms. Darswal served as Special Secretary, Health; Commissioner Food Safety; Drugs Controller, and Project Director for HIV/AIDS Control Programme for the Delhi government.

Ms. Darswal, who recently earned MSc. Economics at University of Texas at Austin, argued that this virus is more elusive and unpredictable than the viruses that have been dealt with before, like flu and HIV. As such, vaccination is unlikely to be a successful strategy in isolation.

At the current rate of vaccination, it would take two years to cover 75% of the Indian population, she said, adding that to get back to normal, there is a need to step up speed and coverage of the population manifold.

“As we aim to achieve the goal of full coverage, we need to move strategically,” Ms. Darswal said and called for the new potential strategy “build, buy and jab”.

“Build: We did exceptionally well in rolling out indigenous vaccines like Covaxin by utilising our expertise and getting priority allocation of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India (SII) – the biggest vaccine manufacturer in the world. Given the sheer number of people we need to vaccinate, the quantum is falling short of the requirement,” she said.

There are at least two major concerns with this gap, Ms. Darswal said. First: the transmission of the virus is not suppressed enough for us to go back to normal. Second: the ‘to and from’ transmission of infection from non-vaccinated to vaccinated population gives a vast laboratory to the virus to learn to evade the immune response and develop into more virulent forms.

“That means we need to come up with modified vaccines frequently, and the goal of achieving transmission control through herd immunity will stretch indefinitely. Therefore, other indigenous vaccine developments, trials, and Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) need to be fast-tracked. Government must keep a keen eye on raw material shortages faced by the SII in the production of the Novavax vaccine due to the export embargo on bags and filters imposed by the Biden administration under the Defence Production Act,” she said.

Production of other stuff such as gloves, refrigerators, syringes among others also needs a full assessment, regulatory ease, and oversight for the long-term.

Observing that meeting the entire requirement for vaccines within the home is possible but would take a long time, Ms. Darswal said utilising India’s pharmaceutical manufacturing strength to get licenses for new manufacture and distribution of vaccines such as the mRNA vaccines is something they can seriously consider.

And finally, India needs to replicate the Bhutan model in thousands of locations using a Primary Health Care (PHC) as the focal centre. Using vaccines gifted by India, Bhutan vaccinated its entire population in two weeks.

Vaccine coverage must be provided at worksites like factories, big markets through market associations among others to ensure workers get vaccinated. Their safety will prevent mass migration as seen during the first lockdown, keep them safe, and add to the communities’ overall immunity, she said.

“Even with a low attributable death rate, given that many people are getting infected in this new wave, the absolute count we may face may be staggering and spread panic among the people. Continuous communication from doctors, political leaders, and administrators is essential to calm the sentiments in this critical time,” said Ms. Darswal, who was a medical doctor before becoming an IAS officer.

“These measures need to be bolstered by solid regulation enforcing mandatory covid appropriate behaviours such as universal mask-wearing, prohibition of activities where people can gather and form crowds, and compulsory maintenance of social-distance when out. Only by being vigilant and responsible can we hope to minimise the damage of the current wave and make fast strides in beating the pandemic for good,” she said.

According to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday, the single day rise in new coronavirus infections inched closer to 3 lakh, pushing India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases to 1,56,16,130, while the death toll increased to 1,82,553 with a record 2,023 daily fatalities.

A total of 2,95,041 fresh infections were registered in a span of 24 hours, while the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark, it said.","The safety committee also ‘concluded that these events should be listed as very rare side effects of the vaccine’.

Eight cases of serious, unusual blood clots associated with low levels of blood platelets, one of which was fatal, have been seen in the U.S. after administration of Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. On April 20, European Medicines Agency’s safety committee (PRAC) based on these cases “concluded that a warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be added to the product information for COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen”. The safety committee also “concluded that these events should be listed as very rare side effects of the vaccine”. As of 13 April 2021, over seven million people had received the vaccine in the U.S.

In a press release, the EMA said that it found “possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets” following administration of Johnson and Johnson vaccine.

On April 13, the U.S. called for a pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccine use when six cases of a rare blood-clotting disorder were seen in the vaccinated people.

All the eight cases were seen in those under 60 years of age within three weeks after vaccination, the majority being in women. “Based on the currently available evidence, specific risk factors have not been confirmed,” the EMA said in a release.

Kai Kupferschmidt, a science journalist, tweeted saying that Sabine Straus, Chair of EMA, told the press that though the U.S. paused vaccination on April 13, cases can still occur for three weeks after immunisation. “So we still have to wait and see if there are more cases coming in, so it's too early to say anything about the real occurrence of the cases,” Ms. Straus had apparently warned.

“At this moment, it's not possible to identify clear risk factors for the occurrence of these very rare events, such as gender or age”, Ms. Straus told the press.

The safety committee also noted that the blood clots occurred mostly at unusual sites such as in veins in the brain (cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, CVST) and the abdomen (splanchnic vein thrombosis) and in arteries, together with low levels of blood platelets and sometimes bleeding. The cases reviewed had close similarity to cases seen after administration of AstraZeneca vaccine.

The EMA stressed that the reported “combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is very rare, and the overall benefits of COVID-19 Vaccine Janssen [owned by Johnson and Johnson] in preventing COVID-19 outweigh the risks of side effects”.

The EMA listed out the symptoms to look out for within three weeks after vaccination. These include shortness of breath; chest pain; swelling in the leg; persistent abdominal pain; neurological symptoms, including severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision; and skin bruising beyond the site of injection.

The safety committee emphasised the importance of prompt specialist medical treatment. “By recognising the signs of blood clots and low blood platelets and treating them early, healthcare professionals can help those affected in their recovery and avoid complications,” the committee said.","India has been elected by acclamation to three bodies of the UN Economic and Social Council.

India was elected by acclamation to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice for a three-year term beginning January 1, 2022.

Austria, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Ghana, Libya, Pakistan, Qatar, Thailand, Togo and the U.S. were also elected by acclamation while Brazil, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Chile, Cuba were elected by secret ballot.

A woman from the capital Damascus has applied to run for President of Syria, the parliament speaker said on Tuesday, making her the first female to make a bid for the country’s top job. The largely symbolic election is certain to be won by President Bashar Assad.

The presidential election, the second since the country’s civil war broke out 10 years ago, is to be held May 26. Syrians abroad will vote on May 20.

Speaker Hammoud Sabbagh said Faten Ali Nahar, a 50-year-old Damascus resident, has nominated herself for the post. Little is known about her. The parliament speaker provided her age, place of birth and her mother’s name in the announcement. There were no reports on who she is on social media.

Two other candidates have submitted their names, including a businessman who ran against Mr. Assad in 2014. Mr. Assad won nearly 90% of the votes in that contest.

Although Mr. Assad has not yet applied, he is widely expected to run and win a fourth seven-year term. He has held power since 2000, when he took over after the death of his father, who ran the country for 30 years.

Syria only began allowing multi-candidate voting in the 2014 elections. Competition with Mr. Assad was symbolic and seen by opposition and Western countries as a sham aimed to give the incumbent President a veneer of legitimacy.

The international community is unlikely to recognise the legitimacy of the upcoming elections. According to the U.N. resolution for a political resolution of the conflict in Syria, a new constitution is supposed to be drafted and approved in a public referendum before U.N.-monitored presidential elections are to take place. But little progress has been made on the drafting committee and Mr. Assad continues to have the backing of Russia and Iran.

Last month, the Biden administration said it will not recognise the result of Syria’s presidential election unless the voting is free, fair, supervised by the United Nations and represents all of Syrian society.

Syria has been in the throes of civil war since 2011, when Arab Spring-inspired protests against the Mr. Assad family rule turned into an armed insurgence in response to a brutal military crackdown.

Separately, Mr. Assad appointed a new governor to the Central Bank on Tuesday days after sacking his predecessor amid a crushing currency crisis.

Mohammad Issam Hazimeh was named the bank’s new governor, replacing Hazem Qarfoul, who has been in the post since 2018. Mr. Hazimeh was Mr. Qarfoul’s deputy and is a graduate of economic law from a French university.

The Syrian pound set a record in March trading on the black market at 4,600 pounds to the dollar. At the start of the conflict, the U.S. dollar was worth 47 Syrian pounds. Last week, the central back set the official rate at 2,512 pounds, down from 1,256 since June, to the dollar.

Years of corruption and mismanagement, followed by a decade of war and escalating Western sanctions against Assad’s government have deepened the hardship for Syrians. The U.N. estimates that 80% of Syrians live in poverty.","New Zealand’s government-run system is currently divided into 20 district health boards, each with their own budget.

New Zealand announced on Wednesday it will consolidate its fragmented healthcare system into a national service similar to the one revered by many in Britain.

New Zealand’s government-run system is currently divided into 20 district health boards, each with their own budget. Some describe the system as a “postcode lottery” of different treatment depending on where people live.

Health Minister Andrew Little said that over three years, the district boards will be replaced by a single new body called Health New Zealand. He promised an increased focus on public health and treating people early so they don't end up in hospitals.

He said the coronavirus pandemic had forced the system into a rare and welcomed collaboration but it wasn’t how it usually worked.

The overhaul also includes a new Indigenous Maori Health Authority.

“Our system has become overly complex. It is far too complicated for a small nation,” Little said. “We simply do not need 20 different sets of decision-makers.”

The extent of the overhaul came as a surprise to many and went beyond the recommendations of a review panel. It was cautiously welcomed by several groups representing doctors and healthcare workers.

But opposition health spokesperson Dr. Shane Reti said the restructure was “reckless” and would see regions and small communities lose their voices. He said the government had an ideology of centralised control.

“Health New Zealand will likely end up as just another bureaucracy that governments will have to fund, instead of investing the money where it's needed most,” Reti said.

Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said a new public health agency would mean experts would be better-placed to fight future pandemics and could focus more strategically on problems like diabetes, cancer and heart disease.

And Associate Health Minister Peeni Henare said the new Maori Health Authority would allow more control for Maori, who suffer worse health on average than other New Zealanders.

The New Zealand health system is government subsidised but patients still need to pay a portion of the cost when visiting the doctor or accessing many other services. More than one-third of adults opt to pay for the additional benefits offered by private health insurers.","Beijing and Washington have persistently clashed over a range of issues

China’s President Xi Jinping will attend a U.S.-led climate change summit on Thursday at the invitation of President Joe Biden, in the first meeting between the two leaders since the advent of the new U.S. administration.

Mr. Biden has invited dozens of world leaders to join the two-day virtual summit starting on Thursday, after bringing the United States back into the 2015 Paris Agreement on cutting global carbon emissions.

Mr. Xi will attend the summit via video and will deliver an “important” speech, Hua Chunying, spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Beijing and Washington have persistently clashed over a range of issues from alleged human rights abuses to China’s economic clout over other nations.

In Alaska last month, U.S. and Chinese officials held the first high-level in-person talks that bristled with rancour and yielded no diplomatic breakthroughs.

But the two countries, the world’s two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, have rediscovered a common interest in battling climate change.

Last week, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry travelled to Shanghai to meet with his Chinese counterpart in the first high-level visit to China by a Biden administration official. Both agreed on concrete actions “in the 2020s” to reduce emissions.

The talks also marked a resumption of climate dialogue halted during the Donald Trump administration, who withdrew from the Paris agreement.","Official said that U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the issue during a phone call on Monday.

The United States is tracking the course of the COVID-19 outbreak in India “very closely”, the State Department has said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised Americans to avoid all travel to India.

“We are tracking the course of the COVID outbreak in India very closely,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters at his daily news conference.

Responding to a question, he said, Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the issue during a phone call on Monday.

“Whether it’s India or any other country, we are committed to doing what we can both at present and going forward to see to it that this virus is brought under control,” he said.

According to the World Health Organisation, from January 3, 2020 to April 20, 2021, India has reported 15.3 million COVID-19 cases and over 1,80,000 deaths. As of April 11, a total of 104 million vaccine doses had been administered, the WHO said.

In the last 24 hours, 2,59,170 new COVID-19 cases and 1,761 deaths were reported in India, the WHO said.","Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator said the talks were moving forward despite difficulties but warned Tehran would halt the negotiations if faced with “unreasonable demands” or time wasting.

Iran and world powers have made headway in talks to save the 2015 nuclear accord though much more work is needed, a senior European Union official said on Tuesday, with meetings to resume next week after consultations in their respective capitals.

“Progress made over the last two weeks,” European External Action Service Deputy Secretary General Enrique Mora said on Twitter. “But much more hard work needed. Third expert group was created to address sequencing issues.”

The talks, aimed at bringing Iran and the United States back into compliance with the nuclear deal will pick up again next week based on progress achieved so far, Russian and Chinese officials said earlier on Tuesday.

Iran and world powers have been meeting in Vienna since early April to hammer out steps that must be taken, touching on U.S. sanctions and Tehran’s breaches of the deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment capacity.

“Today the Joint Commission of #JCPOA took note with satisfaction of the progress made in negotiations to restore the nuclear deal,” said Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to the U.N. nuclear watchdog (IAEA), referring to the nuclear deal.

“In view of the progress made...so far the Joint Commission of #JCPOA decided to establish the third working group to deal with possible sequencing of practical steps leading to full restoration of the Iranian nuclear deal.”

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration, which took office in January seeking to rejoin the accord, has said it is ready to remove “all sanctions that are inconsistent” with the deal, though not spelled out which measures it means.

Iran’s clerical establishment has said it will not return to strict observance of the 2015 agreement unless all sanctions reimposed or added by former President Donald Trump after he abandoned the accord in 2018 are rescinded first.

Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator said the talks were moving forward despite difficulties but warned Tehran would halt the negotiations if faced with “unreasonable demands” or time wasting.

Iranian officials had on Monday cited the possibility of an interim deal to buy time for a lasting settlement.

Separately, the Iranian government said it had launched enrichment of uranium to 60% fissile purity in order to show its technical capacity after a sabotage attack at a nuclear plant that Tehran has blamed on Israel, which opposes deal-making with Iran. But the escalation of enrichment is quickly reversible if Washington drops sanctions, the government said.

China’s envoy to the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Wang Qun, told reporters after a meeting of the remaining parties to the 2015 deal broke off that the parties had begun a drafting process and were clearer about what a final document would look like.

“We see productive work from the Joint Commission under the leadership of EU colleagues through their two processes, not only the working group process but also their proximity talks with the United States over the past few days,” he said, adding that sanctions-lifting remained the top issue to be resolved.","“The Istanbul meeting is not happening on the given date because the Taliban refused to attend,” a senior Afghan government official told Reuters.

A Washington-backed Afghan peace conference in Turkey has been postponed over non-participation by the Taliban, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

The meeting was scheduled for April 24 to fast-track an agreement between the Taliban insurgents and the Afghan government in light of the announcement by Washington that foreign troops would leave Afghanistan by Sept. 11.

“The Istanbul meeting is not happening on the given date because the Taliban refused to attend,” a senior Afghan government official told Reuters.

The postponement was confirmed by two other sources, including one official whose country is involved in the planning process. There was no immediate revised date.

An Afghan government spokesman declined comment on the matter. A Taliban spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu of Turkey, one of the hosts of the talks, said they had been put off until after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, adding that participation in the conference remained unclear.

U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price did not confirm the postponement but said broader diplomatic efforts will continue: “We’ve always been clear, Istanbul was not a replacement for Doha”.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said earlier on Tuesday that he could not confirm if the conference had been postponed.

“The United Nations, along with the co-conveners, Qatar, Turkey, we’re continuing to engage with representatives of both the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the Taliban on ways to strengthen and add impetus to the intra-Afghan negotiations,” Dujarric told reporters.

The U.N. special envoy for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, was in Doha last week to discuss with Afghan parties “the best way the international community can support them in making progress on their negotiations toward a just and durable political settlement,” Dujarric said.

“Our focus will continue to be on progress in intra-Afghan negotiations, which is a critical part of the way forward.”

A leading U.S. general voiced “grave doubts” on Tuesday about the Taliban’s reliability as a negotiating partner for U.S. and Afghan diplomats after the U.S. military’s withdrawal from America’s longest war.

The Islamist Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, when they were ousted by U.S.-led forces. Since then they have waged a long-running insurgency and still control wide swathes of territory.","Ukraine last week protested the Russian move to close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November.

Russia insisted Tuesday that it has the right to restrict foreign naval ships’ movement off Crimea, rejecting international criticism amid Western worries about a Russian troops buildup near Ukraine.

Ukraine last week protested the Russian move to close broad areas of the Black Sea near Crimea to foreign navy ships and state vessels until November. The U.S. also aired its concern Monday, with State Department spokesman Ned Price saying “this represents yet another unprovoked escalation in Moscow’s ongoing campaign to undermine and destabilize Ukraine.”

Price noted that the move “is particularly troubling amid credible reports of Russian troop buildup in occupied Crimea and around Ukraine’s borders.”

The European Union also voiced concern about the troop buildup and the navigation restrictions.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov charged that the restrictions on foreign naval ships were in line with international agreements, arguing that it’s common practice to limit areas where military drills are held. He emphasized in remarks carried by Russian news agencies that the restrictions wouldn’t interfere with commercial shipping.

In a separate move, Russia on Tuesday also announced restrictions on flights near Crimea for five days starting Tuesday.

The Russian military is holding massive Black Sea maneuvers this week, involving more than 20 warships and dozens of aircraft.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov argued that such airspace closures are common international practice.

Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 after the country’s former Russia-friendly president was driven from power by protests. Moscow then threw its weight behind separatists in eastern Ukraine, and the conflict there has killed more than 14,000 people in seven years.

Tensions have risen in recent weeks with increasing violations of a cease-fire in eastern Ukraine and a massive Russian troop buildup along the Ukrainian border. Moscow has rejected Ukraine and Western concerns, arguing that it’s free to deploy its forces and charging that they don’t threaten anyone.

But at the same time, Moscow sternly warned Ukrainian authorities against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel east, noting recent statements by Ukrainian military officers who held the door open for an offensive. The Kremlin said that Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Tuesday accused Ukraine of trying to destabilize the situation in eastern Ukraine and lashed out at the U.S. and NATO for what he described as “provocative actions” in the Black Sea area.

The U.S. and its NATO allies have regularly sent navy ships to the Black Sea and the U.S. flew strategic bombers over Ukraine, vexing Moscow. However, the U.S. reversed a planned deployment of two destroyers in the Black Sea earlier this month amid the heightening tensions.

The Russian military has conducted a series of drills in southwestern Russia, in Crimea and other areas. On Tuesday, a pair of Tu-160 nuclear-capable strategic bombers flew over the Baltic Sea for eight hours, and the Northern Fleet conducted massive maneuvers in the Arctic, the Defense Ministry said.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba insisted Tuesday that Kyiv wasn’t planning any offensive in the east.

“No, Ukraine is not planning any offensive, military escalation or provocations,” he said at a news conference, adding that “we are making every effort for a diplomatic and peaceful resolution of the conflict.”

Kuleba charged that the Russian buildup across the border is continuing and is “expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops” in about a week and urged the West to beef up sanctions against Moscow by targeting entire sectors of the Russian economy.

On Monday, the EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, told reporters that there are “more than 150,000 Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian borders and in Crimea,” and doubled down on the figure later before his services had to correct it in the transcript, saying the real figure was over 100,000.

Recent satellite images showed hundreds of Russian military vehicles stationed at multiple bases, firing ranges and field camps along the border with Ukraine and dozens of warplanes parked at air bases in southwestern Russia and Crimea.","A racially-diverse jury of seven women and five men in the Midwestern city of Minneapolis took less than two days at the end of a three-week trial to find the white officer guilty in unanimous decisions.

Former Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin, 45, was found guilty of murder and manslaughter by a jury on Tuesday, nearly a year after he used his knee to pin the neck of an African American man, George Floyd, to the ground, killing him. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, faces a potential 40-year jail sentence.

Mr. Floyd's death sparked 'Black Lives Matter' protests for racial justice across America, the likes of which the country had not seen since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.

Mr. Floyd’s brother, Philonise, speaking to CNN, described sitting in the courtroom listening to the verdict as, ""a moment I would never be able to re-live, I will always have inside of me."" An emotional Philonise Floyd talked about his faith and listed the names of other victims of police violence.

Tuesday's result was announced after a jury of six white and six racial minorities reached a (necessarily) unanimous verdict deliberated for some ten hours and found Mr. Chauvin guilty on counts of second degree unintentional murder, third degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.

Mr. Floyd had said, ""I can't breathe,"" repeatedly during the approximately nine minute encounter with Mr. Chauvin on May 25 last year, an encounter that was filmed by bystanders, particularly a teenage girl, whose footage went viral on social media. Witnesses to the incident pleaded with the police to stop let go of Mr. Floyd.

Three other officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder in the second degree.

The trial was televised and Mr. Chauvin, 45, dressed in a grey suit and wearing a surgical mask, appeared to listen intently, eyes darting from side to side, as the judge read out the verdict for each of three charges brought against him by the State of Minnesota. The judge revoked his bail $1 million and Mr. Chauvin was handcuffed and taken into custody immediately.

While the verdict was welcomed in Washington D.C., the expressions of relief were tempered with reminders that this was a beginning and not an end to systematic racism.

""Today a jury in Minneapolis did the right thing,"" former U.S. President Barack Obama wrote, saying justice was done in this particular case at least. ""But if we're being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial,"" Mr. Obama, said.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first African American woman in her position, addressed the nation on Tuesday night after the verdict was announced.

""America has a long history of systemic racism,"" she said, adding that Black people – Black men in particular – have been treated as ""less than human"" throughout the course of history.

""Black men are fathers, and brothers, and sons, and uncles, and grandfathers, and friends, and neighbours. Their lives must be valued in our education system, in our health-care system, in our housing system, in our economic system, in our criminal-justice system, in our nation,"" Ms. Harris said.

""It was a murder in the full light of day,"" Mr. Biden said, calling systemic racism ""a stain on the nation's soul."" Mr. Biden said he had spoken with the family of Mr. Floyd again – he had spoken with them on Monday.

""I'm praying that the verdict is the right verdict,"" Mr. Biden had said earlier. It is rare for a sitting President to comment on the outcome of a trial before its conclusion. However, Mr. Biden said he had waited until the jury was sequestered (i.e., without access to the outside world) before calling the family.

""Let's also be clear that such a verdict is also much too rare,"" Mr. Biden said on Tuesday night. ""For so many people, it seems like it took a unique and extraordinary convergence of factors. A brave young woman with a smartphone camera, a crowd who was traumatised… a murder that lasts [sic] almost ten minutes in broad daylight… officers standing up and testifying against a fellow officer instead of just closing ranks… for so many it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver… just basic accountability.""

Mr. Chauvin will be sentenced in approximately eight weeks.","The Department of Homeland Security said the U.S. would approve an additional 22,000 H2-B seasonal, non-agricultural worker visas on top of the annual limit of 66,000 set by Congress.

President Joe Biden’s administration announced an increase Tuesday in the number of temporary seasonal workers who will be allowed to work in the U.S. this year as the U.S. economy recovers from the pandemic.

The Department of Homeland Security said the U.S. would approve an additional 22,000 H2-B seasonal, non-agricultural worker visas on top of the annual limit of 66,000 set by Congress. It cited increased demand from employers, with the number of people seeking jobless benefits at the lowest point since the outbreak of COVID-19.

The H2-B program has bipartisan support in Congress and with businesses across the nation, though immigration opponents portray it as taking jobs from Americans. The visas are used to fill jobs in landscaping, construction, hotels and restaurants as well as in seafood and meat processing plants and amusement parks.

Employers must show they tried to recruit U.S. workers and then certify that they will suffer “irreparable harm” without a foreign, seasonal worker in order to qualify for the program, DHS said in a statement announcing the supplemental increase.

President Donald Trump last year authorized an additional 35,000 H-2B visas above the annual cap. But then three months later he halted foreign worker programs to preserve U.S. jobs during the pandemic under an executive order. Biden let that order expire.

The U.S. will set aside 6,000 visas for people from the Northern Triangle countries of Central America, where long-standing economic and social problems deteriorated further because of the pandemic and two hurricanes that struck the region.

People from the Northern Triangle countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala made up nearly half of the migrants apprehended at the U.S. southwest border last month, part of an increase that has turned into an early test for Biden.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said that setting aside visas for Central Americans reflects the administration’s goal of “expanding lawful pathways for opportunity in the United States” for people from the Northern Triangle countries.

At the U.N. on Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield outlined plans to provide additional humanitarian aid to the region and to work with other nations and the private sector to help modernize the countries. She noted that at least 5 million people in Central America don’t have enough food.

“They need security, economic opportunity and access to food to feed their families,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “That’s what’s driving them from their homes. So ultimately, that’s what we need to address.”","The European Commission’s rules, known as its “sustainable finance taxonomy,” include a list of economic activities and the criteria they must meet to be labelled as green investments in the EU from next year.

European Union countries are divided over whether to delay landmark green investment regulations, with eight heads of government on Tuesday urging Brussels to push back the rules, a day before it is due to publish them.

The European Commission’s rules, known as its “sustainable finance taxonomy,” include a list of economic activities and the criteria they must meet to be labelled as green investments in the EU from next year.

The aim is to steer private capital into activities that will help the EU meet its climate goals.

But the regime has become a battleground for lobbying from governments, who disagree over what should be labelled as green.

A draft Commission proposal, seen by Reuters last week, lays out rules for various sectors, including transport, industry and buildings. But it delays decisions on whether natural gas-fuelled power plants and nuclear energy can be classed as “green” - two key issues which divide EU countries.

The prime ministers of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and five other countries wrote to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, opposing the plan to delay gas and nuclear, and urging the Commission to only publish the rules when they can address all energy technologies.

“Even if it costs a delay in adopting the legislation, the objective of having good and ambitious rules for all relevant technologies and sources of energy is worth it,” the letter, seen by Reuters, said.

It was also signed by the president of Cyprus and the prime ministers of Bulgaria, Malta, Romania and Slovakia.

Separately, seven EU countries including Germany, Spain and Austria wrote to the Commission on April 16, urging it not to delay the rules.

Market participants who must comply with the rules next year need legal certainty now, said the letter, also signed by Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Luxembourg.

The Commission had hoped to finish the rules in January, but delayed that plan to April after its original proposal -- which denied gas power plants a green label -- triggered pushback from central and eastern states which see the fuel as necessary for them to ditch more-polluting coal.

That view clashes with the position of the EU’s expert advisers on the regime, and some generally wealthier western and Nordic states which say labelling gas, a fossil fuel, as green would undermine EU policies to fight climate change.

The Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.","The hosting of Saudi-Iran talks is also a significant step for Iraq, which has ties with both the U.S. and Iran and has often borne the brunt of Saudi-Iran rivalry.

A first round of direct talks between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran signaled a possible de-escalation following years of animosity that often spilled into neighboring countries and at least one still-raging war. But few expect quick results.

The talks, hosted by Iraq earlier this month, were confirmed on Tuesday to The Associated Press by an Iraqi and a Western official in Baghdad.

They came as the Biden administration paves the way for re-opening diplomatic channels in the region. Saudi Arabia is recalibrating its regional position after losing an unflinching supporter in President Joe Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump. Iran, meanwhile, has calculated that a gradual detente with Riyadh, a long-time U.S. ally, will work in its favor during renewed nuclear talks with Washington and world powers.

Saudi Arabia has sought talks with Iran as the kingdom tries to end its years-long war in Yemen against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. In recent months, the Houthis have increasingly launched missiles and bomb-laden drones at the kingdom, targeting crucial sites and oil infrastructure. Ending that war could be a bargaining chip for the Iranians as they seek sanctions relief from from nuclear talks in Vienna.

The hosting of Saudi-Iran talks is also a significant step for Iraq, which has ties with both the U.S. and Iran and has often borne the brunt of Saudi-Iran rivalry.

A senior Iraqi official said recent trips by Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi to Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates have been key in bringing Iranian and Saudi interlocutors to the table.

Details of the initial meeting, first reported by The Financial Times, have been sparse. The thorny subject of the Yemen war figured prominently, the Iraqi official said. The Saudi-Iran rivalry has played out on multiple fronts, mostly in Yemen, as well as in Iraq and Lebanon — both home to powerful Iran-backed militias. A breakthrough in Iran-Saudi talks could have far-reaching repercussions in those countries and across the region.

It was not clear how much progress, if any, was made in the talks, but the Western diplomat suggested there will be more meetings. The pro-Iran Lebanese newspaper, al-Akhbar, said a new round of talks would be held in Baghdad next week, following a “very positive” first meeting.

“My understanding is that these talks will be ongoing and mediated by Baghdad,” the diplomat said. Both the diplomat and Iraqi official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secretive contacts with the media. They declined to elaborate, saying they wanted to give Iraqi mediation efforts a chance to succeed.

Neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia have offered official confirmation that the talks took place, though Iranian officials have alluded to them, and welcomed them.

The Iranian ambassador to Iraq on Tuesday praised Baghdad’s recent diplomatic efforts, hinting at the Saudi-Iran talks without mentioning the kingdom.

“It seems that the regional and international situation has created a more positive atmosphere for the resolution of some problems between Iran and other nations,” Iraj Masjedi told the state-run IRNA news agency in an interview in Baghdad.

“We would be happy if Iraq could be able to play any role in the direction of Iran’s closeness with nations that we have some challenges with.”

When asked whether Iraq’s mediation has borne fruit, he said the talks “have not reached any clear result and not met any remarkable progress.”

Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals. Relations worsened considerably in 2016, when Riyadh removed its diplomats after protesters attacked its embassy in Tehran and consulate in Mashhad in retaliation for the kingdom’s executing the Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr. Those posts have remained closed ever since. At the time, Iraq offered itself as a possible mediator between the two countries.

Apart from Iraqi lobbying efforts, other key shifts in the wake of the Biden presidency paved the way for the talks.

Saudi Arabia is seeking to improve relations with the Biden administration which, unlike the Trump administration, has criticized the kingdom’s human rights record, particularly after the 2018 killing of dissident Saudi writer and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

The Saudis also want to test “whether Iranians have control over the Houthis, whether they are willing to exercise it,” said Randa Slim, director of the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute. “It’s a testing phase of wills, and interest.”

Meanwhile, changes in Iran’s handling of Iraq also played a role. The intelligence arm of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard held sway over Iraq through Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. But Soleimani’s killing in a 2020 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad has seen Iran’s Intelligence Ministry grow more powerful there, said the Iraqi official.

The Guard reports directly to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and holds hard-line views. The Intelligence Ministry reports to Iran’s relatively moderate President Hassan Rouhani. While cooperating, the two services are rivals within Iran’s theocracy.

This change of guard was key in bringing Iranians to the table in Baghdad, Iraqi officials said.

“They have a new view, a new discourse, they want a stronger Iraq,” one Iraqi official said of the Intelligence Ministry officials. “The (Guard) calculated differently, they wanted the opposite, a weak Iraq was more beneficial to them.”"
"There are no shared tiffins or dorms this year. Yet, friendships are blossoming over cross-country Secret Santas, socially distanced walks and Zoom dance parties. This is the new college experience

It’s been a year since I joined college, and I haven’t once stepped into my classroom. I haven’t ambled across the campus, I haven’t whiled away afternoons over samosas at the canteen, I haven’t conspired a mass bunk in the back benches, I haven’t run tirelessly from corner to corner preparing for the college fest.

All my classmates are in tiny boxes on a screen in my lap.

Can you be friends with someone you have never met, but spent over 100 hours talking to? It is a strange idea of friendship, one that us first-year college students have been perplexed by, ever since we enrolled in 2020.

A year into the COVID pandemic, this is the new college experience. What seemed like a stop-gap measure in 2020, online classes have changed the way 17- and 18-year-olds are approaching new friendships.

For many teenagers, college is their first window into adult life. The homogeneity of schools gives way as they meet people from a wider variety of backgrounds. The hours and hours spent together in libraries, hostels and dive bars result in a lifetime of influential alumni networks and friendships.

Could this experience be just the same on a single computer screen? I ask others in the same boat as me.

A digital family

In the past year, over group projects, assignments, and Zoom classes, Vedant Dugar found a close bond with his classmates from Mumbai, Gurugram and Kolkata. Often, their days would begin by waking each other up for attendance. (In online classes, you have the luxury of waking up 15 minutes before class. If anything goes wrong, or you don’t know the answer to a question asked, there is always the convenient ‘network issues’ excuse).

By February 2021, they decided to fly down to Mumbai, even though their college was still shut, to finally spend some time in real life.

“It didn’t feel like I was meeting them for the first time because I already knew so much about them,” says Vedant.

“I didn’t expect the first year of college to be like this even in my wildest dreams. But once you find the right people — online or offline, everything works itself out,” says Ayushi Jain, an 18-year-old studying Economics at MOP Vaishnav College in Chennai. The girls in her batch, she says, cherish a close bond — surprising, as a majority of them had not met each other despite being in the same city.

Classmates from MOP Vaishnav College meet in Chennai

“Initially, it was funny knowing your new best friend lives only 15 minutes away and you still can’t meet her,” says Ayushi of her friend, Chetana Boothra, who like her, lives in T Nagar.

Long calls for work eventually turned into lighter conversation and fostered deeper, meaningful relationships. But to help break the ice, they first had to move away from the stilted formality of Zoom classes. In after-school icebreaker sessions, party games like ‘2 truths and 1 lie’ helped get them more comfortable. When they did finally meet, it was at college while submitting their documents. Spotting and recognising mask-covered faces that they had only so far seen on their screens was like a game in itself, says Ayushi.

She and Chetana have now started to coordinate their morning walks so they can meet each other safely. The girls hope to eventually be able to meet up as a class at least once a month — at cafes, restaurants or the beach. “It’s such a tough time but having each other’s back through it all helps,” she says.

Back in 2020, Salem-based Mithali Surana, a 1st year BBA student had zero expectations from online classes. Making friends had never been an issue for the self-proclaimed extrovert, but she adds, “I was very sceptical about how genuine virtual friends could even be.”

What she did not foresee was that she would be binge-watching romcoms till 2.30 am every other night and practising Chloe Ting workouts in the day, with these very new-found friends. When Mitali came to visit her friends in Chennai for the first time, she stayed at her best friend’s house, whom she had just met, for two days.

Because, she eventually discovered that as difficult as it is making friends online, the more real is the connection for it requires that much greater time and effort.

Just ask the first-year students of ISDI, Mumbai. In the class of 28 people, everyone is scattered across 22 states including Gujarat, West Bengal, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and more.

That did not stop 13 of them from playing a cross-country Secret Santa last December. In a sisterhood of travelling gifts, everyone couriered their presents to another and on Christmas Eve, unwrapped them together while guessing who it was from.

“Whenever it is someone’s birthday, or the end of an exam, or a festival, we party online. Everyone grabs some snacks and something to drink. We synchronise our virtual backgrounds and this one friend plays the DJ and makes us dance,” says Khushiyaa Taleda from Chennai.

At the end of the day whether we’re in front of a laptop screen at home or seated side-by-side in a classroom, it’s the people that make the experience magical.

Cross country for you

At Chennai’s Loyola college, however, the party was not virtual. Before the second surge began, and the situation seemed stable, the first year batch planned an informal fresher’s day in March 2021. Of the 26 people that made it, 15 were from Chennai. The rest flew in from Delhi and Kerala, and other parts of Tamil Nadu such as Salem, Coimbatore and Erode.

Hosted at Level Up in Aminijikarai, they met the faces they had only ever seen on Zoom calls, muddling through awkward introductions. A twisted version of Bingo to crown a Mr Fresher soon warmed things up. The boys, joined by their seniors, headed over to a private villa on ECR and stayed up the entire night, talking. When they left the next day, they were unsure if they would ever meet again in person.

Cut to the second wave of the pandemic, and now with Mumbai under a crippling load of positive cases, the ISDI batch can only dream of meeting their friends from other cities. They wonder out loud how they would react when they do. Dramatic gushing? Sprinting? Bear hugs?

“If we meet.. No, wait not ‘if’, when we meet it’s going to be a full Bollywood kind of run and hug,” says Khushiyaa, ""And I can’t wait.”"

"From quality upgrades and spacious interiors to supple ride comfort and strong performance, the series possess a lot of appeal

First launched in India in 2018, the BMW 6 Series Gran Turismo (6GT) is a more practical and comfier alternative to the 5 Series sedan. Now, BMW has introduced the facelifted 6GT in India, bringing with it updated styling and new features. So, what is it like?

The most prominent changes to the 6GT’s design are the sleeker headlamps with twin L-shaped DRLs and the bolder, more aggressive-looking grille. This M Sport variant additionally gets sportier design touches, such as the trendier front bumper, lightweight 19-inch M alloy wheels and blue brake calipers, and twin trapezoidal exhausts tips to further enhance its looks.

The other styling highlights of this car are its uber cool frameless doors, which lift its premium quotient up a notch; however, the soft-close function is only reserved for the diesel M Sport version.

Also new to the line-up are BMW’s sophisticated laser light headlamps which are available in the 6GT M Sport variant. Both high and low beam are laser lights which switch to low beam automatically when it detects oncoming traffic, but also turns up the beam to a certain degree with the steering angle for better visibility.

Step into the bright and airy cabin, and the 6GT impresses with its top-notch quality and levels of finish. The lacquered wood, matte silver highlights and ambient lighting strips are tastefully executed. With the larger twin 12.3-inch screens — one for the instrument cluster and the other for the infotainment — the overall design looks truly modern.

Other features include a panoramic sunroof, four-zone climate control, gesture control, driver’s seat memory, ambient lighting, and wireless charging, to name a few.

Access to the rear seat is quite easy due to the wide opening door, the placement of the rear seat, and the option to raise the car by 20mm, thanks to its air suspension. Once seated, you will appreciate the sheer amount of space on offer — knee-, leg- and headroom are in abundance. Thigh support is spot on, the seatback reclines by 9 degrees to a comfortable angle and the soft pillow on the headrests further enhances comfort.

However, not all is perfect. The rear armrest is placed a bit too high for comfort, and although there are multiple charging provisions at the rear, there is not a wireless charging pad.

The 6GT is available with three engine options — the 258hp and 400Nm, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol (630i), the 190hp 2.0-litre diesel (620d) and the 265hp, 3.0-litre six-cylinder diesel (630d). The one shown here is the 630i.

Owners will love the 2.0-litre turbo-petrol’s smooth and refined character, as well as the strong manner with which it delivers performance. This free-revving motor spins all the way till its 6,800rpm redline rather effortlessly. With all three driving modes — Eco Pro, Comfort and Sport — you also have the option to leave it in Adaptive mode where it examines the driving behaviour and adjusts the responsiveness, damping, steering weight, and more, automatically. The 8-speed torque converter is quick, seamless and intuitive at all times.

Despite riding on 19-inch wheels, ride comfort is supple, and this car cushions the cabin from all but the sharpest of road surfaces. You can even manually raise the ride height by 20mm for easier ingress/egress; it also lowers the ride height from standard by 10mm at the press of a button or when speeds cross 120kph. With a 50:50 weight distribution and a sharp turn-in, the 6GT infuses great confidence in the driver when being driven hard through the corners, though body roll is not as well contained as on the 5 Series.

At ₹67.90 lakh (introductory price) for this 630i M Sport variant, this BMW is much more expensive when compared to the 530i sedan that is priced at ₹56.00-61.50 lakh and a bit dearer than the new E-Class E 200 petrol, priced between ₹63.60-67.20 lakh.

The 630i, however, has a stronger engine than the E-Class, gets air suspension, and strikes a great balance between sporty driving manners and a comfortable chauffeur-driven experience. And now, with the facelift and M-Sport treatment on the outside, the 6 Series has certainly become a lot more appealing than before.","Their design and pricing may just make these ideal for that true blue riding experience

Until a few years ago, Bluetooth connectivity was a novelty that not too many two-wheelers in our market could boast. Now, however, it is becoming a much more common feature, with scooters and motorcycles across different segments allowing you to connect your smartphone to the instrument cluster.

Connecting your device to your vehicle allows for a host of functions, including phone notifications, navigation and ride statistics, depending on the vehicle.

TVS Apache RTR 200 4V

The Apache RTR 200 4V is one of the most feature packed motorcycles in the segment. Its Bluetooth-pairable instrument cluster displays a plethora of information, including lap times, top speed, incoming caller name and more. A dedicated phone app also allows riders to track their ride telemetry and maximum lean angle achieved. However, the latter is recorded using the phone’s gyro sensors and requires the device to be rigidly mounted to the bike in a vertical position.

Hero Xtreme 200S, Xpulse 200, Xpulse 200T

Hero’s trio of 200cc motorcycles — the Xtreme 200S, Xpulse 200 and Xpulse 200T — feature a simple-looking LCD display that offers Bluetooth connectivity. The cluster is connected to your smartphone via the Hero RideGuide app, enabling you to see call status and turn-by-turn navigation, apart from regular information like gear position and trip details.

The Xtreme 200S is priced at ₹1.20 lakh, while the Xpulse 200T and Xpulse 200 are priced at ₹1.16 lakh and ₹1.18 lakh, respectively.

Yamaha FZS-FI

The Yamaha FZS-FI was also recently updated with a Bluetooth-enabled instrument cluster. The Yamaha Motorcycle Connect X App is available on Google Play Store and iOS App Store and offers information about trip distance, battery voltage and average speed. It also provides vehicle location information via the Locate My Bike and Answer Back feature, which turns on the indicators and sounds the horn to help find the bike in a crowded parking lot.

Besides this, the system also has a Hazard mode that turns on all four indicators, to warn others of your presence while parked at the side of the road.

On the downside, the system misses out on turn-by-turn navigation and a call and SMS alerts function. Prices for the new Yamaha FZS-FI start at ₹1.08 lakh. The device can be also fitted as an accessory on the rest of the BS6 FZ-FI and FZS-FI (existing and new motorcycle) range.

Suzuki Access 125, Burgman Street

Back in 2020, the Suzuki Access 125 and Burgman 125 were updated with Bluetooth enabled consoles. The Bluetooth-enabled Access 125 is priced at ₹78,200 (drum brake) and ₹80,200 (disc brake), while the Burgman is priced at ₹86,200. The scooters are also available without Bluetooth for about ₹4,000 less.

The LCD display provides features such as turn-by-turn navigation, call and SMS alert display, WhatsApp alerts, estimated time of arrival, missed call alerts and caller ID, overspeed warning and phone battery level display. Users can connect their smartphone to the console via the ‘Suzuki Ride Connect’ application which, unfortunately, is available only for Android. That said, Suzuki India has said that it will be evaluating iOS compatibility.

TVS Ntorq 125

The TVS Ntorq 125 was one of the first scooters in our market to offer Bluetooth connectivity. Even now, it offers the most technologically advanced instrument console on a combustion engine scooter. The 5-inch LCD display includes a lap timer, a 0-60kph recorder, top speed recorder, engine temperature gauge, average speed indicator and service reminder.

The ‘Smart Xonnect’ system allows all this data to be displayed on your smartphone via Bluetooth. The app also enables you to see phone notifications, a trip report and also displays navigation arrows on the console. Unlike other vehicles in our list, Bluetooth connectivity comes as standard on this TVS. Prices for the TVS Ntorq 125 range between ₹70,555 and

₹79,535.","Case for trial runs

I am undecided between the Husqvarna Vitpilen and the Royal Enfield Meteor Supernova — I know both are different bikes, but I like both of them. The deciding factors for me would be aftersales service and ease of maintainence. In a couple of years, I would like to give it to my son as he will be eligible for a licence.

Vikram, Daman

Both bikes should cost you similar amounts to maintain and both should have decent levels of aftersales reliability. They are very different bikes, as you have pointed out, but a few things to consider are that the Husqvarnas have tall seats, but are rather small motorcycles. The Meteor has a very low seat and it is more comfortable to ride, but it is a large and heavy machine. Both will not be the ideal choice as learner bikes, given these factors, plus the strong performance, especially on the Husqvarna.

The best way for you to decide which of these factors suits you better is to take a test ride on both.

When will the Honda Shine get a digital console meter and LED headlights?

Arif Husain, Patna

There is no clarity on if/when Honda plans to update the Shine with these features. We would recommend you consider the Honda SP 125 to get these features. It is a more premium version of the Honda Shine and it uses the same engine and chassis, and also offers better style and kit.

The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us to be mindful of our surroundings and not take for granted some realities such as hygiene and cleanliness. When the pandemic began, I — like many other students — was stuck at home adapting the new realities of online school. I noticed that, every time new items were brought home, my mother was constantly afraid and anxious about the presence of the coronavirus on these objects. I realised that other families too were probably facing these fears.

Creativity matters

I began thinking about how one could sterilise vegetables, groceries, parcels, and other such necessary items that enter into our homes? Exposure to sunlight, or washing them with soap/baking soda/potassium permanganate, or using sanitisers are all options but each one has its drawback. This is when I got the idea of creating the Suraksha Box, which works on the principle of using UVC light to sterilise.

The box has a mesh on which the items are placed and subjected to UVC light in a controlled environment. It has a range of around 240 nanometres, which is optimum to destroy RNA and DNA of viruses. This was launched on October 2, 2020, with a Government of India (MC&I) patent published. It has also been approved and certified by the CSIR-CMERI of the Government of India.

This is a mass audience product, not restricted to any specific demographic, and can be customised to create versions to suit different environments like metro stations, government schools, airports and other public areas.

As an entrepreneur and an innovator, I believe that extreme times have always led human beings to be innovative, and to come out with unique solutions. What today’s youngsters need is right guidance, resources and ecosystem that supports and promotes skills such as critical thinking, problem solving and creativity.

A majority of IIT Delhi students surveyed by the Board of Student Welfare have said they want the current semester to be halted for now because of the stress they are under because of the Covid situation in the country. The students have suggested at the rest of the semester be conducted in July.

A majority of IIT Delhi students want the current semester to be halted for now because of the stress they are under because of the Covid situation in the country, according to a survey by the Board of Student Welfare. The students have suggested that the rest of the semester be conducted in July.

The board had surveyed 450 students on April 19. A statement issued by the board said that of the respondents, around 64 per cent had family members who were suffering from Covid, and 14 per cent of the students were themselves infected. Out of these, the statement said, 85 per cent were at home and 12 per cent lodged at government facilities.

The survey asked students about their wellbeing and 34 per cent said they were not good but could cope; 21 per cent said that the recent times were very, very harsh; 16 per cent said times were not good and they needed help; 16 per cent said they felt they were doing better than others and only 10 per cent said that they had no problems.

Most of the students said since they or their family members were suffering from Covid, they were having difficulty attending online classes and doing regular assignments. “The mental peace of the students is degrading seeing the number of cases and difficulties faced after you test positive (medicines not available, beds not available),” the statement said.

“Some are stressed because they are not able to find jobs or internships which are very important for them at this point… Many of them underperformed in minors (exams) due to the stressful environment,” it added.

Students also said they felt that they are not getting much help as “professors have not been very lenient and have been giving strict deadlines for almost all courses. In scenarios like these, if a student has Covid themselves or someone in their family has it, they miss out on a lot, which ultimately affects their grades significantly,” said the statement.

Among other suggestions was a 7 to 10 day break immediately to cope with the present situation, anxiety and stress; taking regular feedback from students’ reduction in academic pressure; welfare sessions to mental health and reduction in financial burden."


"The Election Commission (EC) on Wednesday rejected the Trinamool Congress’ suggestion to merge the remaining three phases of voting in West Bengal citing legal and resource constraints.

TMC leader Derek O’Brien had written a letter to the West Bengal Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Aariz Aftab on Tuesday, urging him to consider the party’s request amid the steep hike in Covid-19 cases.

“Two equally important issues are at stake: the right to life and public health and the right to hold elections,” TMC’s letter to the CEO stated. The EC has to make a choice, the letter read.

It urged the poll body to take necessary steps and said that measures taken previously, such as reducing the campaigning period, were only ‘cosmetic’.

The Commission, in its response, told O’Brien that changing the schedule of elections planned “much in advance” and involving a “complex interplay of variety of factors” is not feasible.

To TMC’s argument that parties and candidates have had adequate time for campaigning and, hence, clubbing the remaining phases will not hurt anyone’s chances, the EC said it would be legally incorrect to treat campaigning meant for one phase as electioneering for others.

“Every phase of election is distinct and different, which is why a separate notification is issued for each phase. Each phase also has its dedicated time for campaigning. It’s legally difficult to club the remaining phases since they have been notified already,” a senior EC officer told The Indian Express.

The poll body also drew the party’s attention to the fact that the Commission has already curtailed the campaigning hours and extended the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours before the remaining phases of elections.

“In view of extension of the silence period, there would in any case be no campaigning from 6.30 pm on 26.4.2021 (date of poll of 7th phase) to 29.4.21 (date of poll of 8th phase). Further, the Commission has already mandated detailed guidelines to ensure that safety norms are adhered to without any exceptions and Chief Secretary, WB CEO and concerned DEOs have been directed to strictly enforce the same,” EC’s letter states.","People queue up in front of a booth in North 24 Parganas during the fifth phase of polls. (Express photo by Shashi Ghosh)

The sixth phase of polls will be held in West Bengal on Thursday, with voting set to be conducted at 14,480 polling stations in 43 Assembly constituencies across parts of North 24 Parganas, Nadia, Uttar Dinajpur and Purba Bardhaman.

Among the 306 candidates whose political fate will be decided during this phase are heavyweights such as Bharatiya Janata Party’s national vice-president Mukul Roy, Trinamool Congress ministers Jyotipriyo Mallick and Chandrima Bhattacharya, and CPI(M) leader Tanmay Bhattacharya. Also among the prominent names are film director Raj Chakraborty and actor Koushani Mukherjee, who are TMC’s candidates from the Barrackpore and the Krishnanagar North constituencies respectively.

The poll panel has decided to deploy at least 1,071 companies of central forces during the sixth phase of polls, an Election Commission official told PTI. These elaborate arrangements have been put in place following five deaths, including four who were killed after security forces opened fire in Cooch Behar during the fourth phase of polls on April 10. The deaths triggered a bitter war of words between TMC and BJP, with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee calling for Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation and Prime Minister Narendra Modi accusing her of “playing politics over dead bodies”.

Meanwhile, the sixth phase of polls is being held in the midst of an unprecedented Covid surge. West Bengal registered its highest-ever single-day spike, with 9,819 people testing positive. A total of 2.95 lakh Covid cases 2,023 deaths were recorded in the country in the last 24 hours.

TMC had submitted a memorandum to the Election Commission urging it to club together phases 6, 7 and 8 of the ongoing polls. Bengal Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury had urged the poll watchdog to defer the last three phases of the election.

Mamata Banerjee, during her recent campaigns, and poll strategist Prashant Kishor have both accused the Modi government of “mishandling” the Covid crisis. However, in a recent interview to The Indian Express, Amit Shah said there is no relation between the ongoing polls and the current spike in Covid cases.

Assembly seats in the Matua strongholds of Bongaon and Krishnanagar, close to the India-Bangladesh border, will go to the polls during the sixth phase.

With citizenship for refugees having emerged as one of the poll planks of the BJP in its battle for Bengal, Matua bastions and the verdict they present during this election will prove to be a test case for the party that had been weighing the pros and cons before implementing a new law enacted for the purpose.

With an estimated three million members in the state, the community has the power to influence results in at least four Lok Sabha seats and 30-40 assembly seats in Nadia, North and South 24 Parganas districts.

Both the TMC and the BJP have pitched hard to gain the confidence of Matuas, with the saffron party trying to woo them with its promise of according citizenship to refugees through CAA and Mamata Banerjee saying in her recent rallies that the state government already recognises them as legal citizens.

During his recent campaigns, Amit Shah has accused Banerjee of “denying citizenship to Matuas for vote bank politics”. The Bengal chief minister, in turn, has alleged that Modi’s recent visit to the birthplace of Matua community’s spiritual guru Harichand Thakur, at Orakandi in Bangladesh’s Gopalganj district, was a part of his “outreach” to the community for “vote marketing”.

Elections have been held in 180 constituencies across West Bengal so far, and the remaining 114 seats are set to go to polls between April 22 and 29. Counting of votes will be held on May 2.

"Micro Trends 2021, a display of affordable miniature and small format works by 23 artists at Cholamandal Artists’ Village, aims to takes art beyond a niche audience

In 1971, KCS Panicker, president of the Progressive Painters’ Association founded in 1944, led a brigade of artists from Madras to Pune to display miniature works. To everyone’s surprise, they returned empty-handed having sold all the artworks. Veteran artist P Gopinath was one among them.

He recalls, “Back then, the artworks were priced from ₹25 to ₹100.” Students and unconventional patrons who wished to make inroads into art collection through accessible art, made up most of the buyers. “They used to tell us that they liked paintings and sculptures but didn’t have a big space to exhibit large artworks,” says Gopinath. Thanks to the overwhelming response, the same group then showed in Bombay and Madras in 1972, only to meet a similar interest.

In 2021, after a bleak year coloured by an ongoing pandemic, the same format makes up Micro Trends 2021, a physical exhibition that shows works of 23 artists at Cholamandal Artists’ Village. Though Micro Trends was earlier shown in 2015 and 2017, this time around, it becomes the first physical exhibition that the participating artists have been in, since a year.

With a rich line-up of veteran and budding artists, the display boasts of multiple narratives and many themes — the only common factor being that the works are of a smaller format (small in size, and affordable) .

A metal relief work by S Saravanan | Photo Credit: special arrangement

S Saravanan, the sitting president of the Progressive Painters’ Association says, “The price and size of an artwork is always in the way of the viewer. Nowadays, big paintings or sculptures can’t be seen in modern homes because of the lack of space. So, the small works if priced low, can reach a larger art-loving public. The accessibility can also create a genuine home for art. Art should not be considered a luxury.”

Each of the artists have contributed four of their works to the display that houses paintings not more than 1 ft x 1 ft and sculptures not taller than 1 ft.

Senior artists who make up the Madras Art Movement, like P Gopinath, SG Vasudev, M Senathipathi, D Venkatapathy, C Douglas, Akkitham Narayanan, PS Nandhan, Premalatha Seshadri are contributors. A miniature format is often the only way through which first-time buyers, amateur collectors and art students can get their hands on works by these giants.

“Apart from canvases, works done on granite, metal relief, copper-welded sculptures... are part of the exhibition. And these are especially difficult to make in a miniature format,” says Saravanan who also strayed away from his medium of comfort (acrylic on canvas) to experiment with handmade metal relief work.

He explains the laborious process, “The metal is beaten and brough to shape. It is then engraved and coloured with enamel colours. Once the metal is heated, the enamel colour melts and sticks to the metal. Finally, a silver polishing is done and the work is coated in oil paints to render it an antique quality.” The detailing calls for a lot of physical labour, especially as a miniature.

Gopinath agrees. “Making smaller works is more difficult because you are constantly concentrating on the space. There is more work involved.”

His semi-abstract paintings (acrylic on canvas) with emphasis on patterns and colours, asks the question, “What makes a real picture?” This untitled series was done over a few weeks.

“Working and reworking goes on until one is satisfied,” he adds. S Hemalatha, a sculptor who specialises on lending contemporary tones to mythological characters and traditional temple motifs, has displayed sculptures of Ganesha, Jesus Christ and a rendition of a dancing fish. “In a miniature sculpture, each and every part is very minute. Even while welding parts, it has to be held with precision and care. But many art lovers show a lot of interest,” adds Hemalatha whose works are around six inches in height.

Though the past year had been financially difficult for many in Cholamandal Artists’ Village, they were able to work undisturbed for longer periods, resulting in collections that are ready to be displayed. The market however continues to be dull.

Micro Trends 2021 hopes to reach out to the city, and capture imaginations through art again.

Micro Trends 2021 will be on display till April 30 from 9.30 am to 6.30 pm, including Sundays. There will be thermal screenings and sanitising stations at the gallery. Viewers will be allowed entry in a staggered manner.","As the iconic Partition Museum, Amritsar, wins ‘Best Wider World Tourism Project’, Lady Kishwar Desai speaks on the future of history tourism amid the pandemic

As one of the pillars of India’s recorded history, the Partition Museum in Amritsar located in the graceful red brick Town Hall has made the country proud, winning the ‘Best Wider World Tourism Project’ award at the British Guild of Travel Writers International Tourism (BGTW) Awards 2020, held online on April 18 in the United Kingdom.

Simon Willmore, Chair of BGTW, dubbed the public museum — launched by The Arts and Cultural Heritage Trust — “a first-class example of a tourism project that is having a positive impact on the community and the environment.”

Landmarks all

The museum opened its doors to the public in August 2017 after more than a year of planning and development of what would be the world’s first museum and memorial on the Partition. It comprises 14 galleries, all housing audio-visual records, artworks of various mediums (photographs to paintings), as well as numerous refugee artefacts.

During the pandemic, the museum adapted to social distancing by making tours virtual and hosting online film screenings, talks and exhibitions. The museum also teamed up with Google Arts & Culture for virtual interactive showcases like The Railways and Partition. It also collaborated with the District Education Department for an educational programme with audio-visual files to facilitate a virtual tour for schoolchildren.

New beginnings

Looking ahead, there will also be a second museum on the Partition at the Dara Shikoh Library Building, Old Delhi, which will be ready by August 15, in time for India@75. The adaptive reuse of this historic building has been possible through the Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, and the Art, Culture and Language Department, Government of Delhi. Additionally, paying homage to DSLB’s cultural and historical significance, the building will be converted into a hub for curated cultural experiences, tentatively titled Daastaan-e-Dilli.

There will also be performing arts venues, a café as well as a library and reading room. This space will offer both physical and virtual events many of which will include sections on Sufism.

Thrilled at the win, Lady Kishwar Desai, an author and Chair of the Arts and Culture Heritage Trust, speaks of the future of museum tourism amid a difficult year. “What we are experiencing now is a temporary phenomena, perhaps disrupting travel for a year or two which is nothing in the history of civilisation. After all, we still visit Hampi and Khajuraho hundreds of years after these were created,” she says. “Museums are modern methods of preserving history and culture and once the pandemic is behind us, people will want to travel again and these museums will hopefully outlast the events of today.”

She continues, “We would request philanthropists and patrons of culture to support museums, as these are permanent legacies which will continue to draw crowds and evoke curiosity among tourists capturing history and heritage for future generations. There is a huge impact of a physical structure which virtual experiences cannot replace, but each can support the other.”"
