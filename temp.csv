He said the biggest gap between the two countries was in the cyber domain and it was being addressed in a serious manner. </p><p>“We know China is capable of launching cyber-attacks on us. And that it (China) can disrupt a large amount of our systems,” Rawat said in response to a question after delivering a talk on Shaping the Armed Forces to Meet Likely Current and Future Challenges. Vivekananda International Foundation organised the event. </p><p>Rawat said India was trying to create systems for cyber defence to deal with such attacks. He said cyber agencies in the military were working to ensure that “the downtime and the effect of a cyber-attack” did not last long. </p><p>“We should be able to overcome cyber-attacks and continue with our systems either through an alternative or preventive means through firewalls. So, while we are trying to create firewalls for cyber-attacks, yet we are quite sure they (China) will be able to break through the firewalls…But then what we are trying to do is how long will your system be down, and how will you be able to operate through that phase of cyber-attack you have been put through. That is one thing we are looking at and addressing in a serious manner,” he said. </p><p>The CDS’s comments come at a time when India and China are locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh and efforts are underway to withdraw front-line troops and weaponry from friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC). </p><p>Rawat said India was developing new technologies to bridge the gap with China. The CDS said closing the technology gap with the neighbour would require integration of the resources of the three services. </p><p>“The three services are at different levels as far as our technology orientation is concerned. The navy is far ahead of the army and the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the way they have imbibed technology. If you integrate, you will at least be able to catch up with them (China). We may not be able to fully catch up with China, so we are trying to develop some kind of a relationship with western nations to see how we can get better support from them during peacetime at least to see how we can overcome this deficiency,” Rawat said. </p><p>Cyber has, perhaps, come to acquire a pivotal position in any nation’s security architecture, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. </p><p>“While preparing to acquire offensive capability, it is critical that one’s own systems are protected. While we may be lagging behind China, our nation does not lack cerebral capital to catch up unlike in other capital acquisitions. All efforts must be made to tap the nation’s inherent cyber know-how to protect our vital infrastructure from cyber intrusions,” Bahadur said. </p><p>Responding to a question on the challenges to theaterisation and the ongoing efforts to bring about jointness among the three services, Rawat said India as a nation believed in status quo and there was always a hesitation to change. </p><p>“Also, there is a feeling amongst the three services that army being a very large service --- compared to navy and IAF --- will possibly usurp the two entities and everything will become army-centric. I think this is a misnomer because the army, navy and IAF have their own specialties. They will retain their autonomy and integration will only ensure that we have systems that at least operate together,” Rawat said. </p><p>On women in the armed forces, the CDS said the services were opening more roles to them and there were some areas where they were performing better than men and vice-versa. He said the armed forces were looking at exploiting the capabilities of both men and women and ensuring they were utilised in roles they were best suited for. </p><p>“There are some tasks that are better performed by women. For example, when we look at cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum computing --- areas where you need concentration and the ability to sit long hours on the desk --- we have found that the women workforce is better capable than the men folk. So somewhere the women have shown better capability and there are some areas where men have better capability,” Rawat said. </p><p>One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992. </p><p>This year, the navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. The army has decided to allow them to fly helicopters this year onwards.</p>","<p>Mumbai recorded yet another spike of over 10,000 new Covid-19 cases (10,442 to be exact) in the last 24 hours, according to state government's health bulletin on Wednesday. </p><p>Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, too added 59,907 new cases in its tally, which has now reached 31,73,261, the health bulletin showed.</p><p>This is the third time this month that Mumbai has recorded more than 10,000 cases.

He said the fact that the Maoists could vacate the villages around the encounter spot within 20-30 minutes before the attack on the security forces,which would not have been possible without the support of the local people. “They have developed a strong information network,” Jampanna said. </p><p>But how have the Maoists continued to retain their strength — if not wholly, then substantially — despite setbacks and a strong government offensive, especially in the south Chhattisgarh belt? The answer lies in returning to the past and tracing the evolution of the rebellion both in Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring regions. </p><p><b>The Andhra experience </b></p><p>Before 2005, the Nallamala forests encompassing Telangana and Andhra districts was an impregnable fortress of Maoists (who were earlier known as People’s War Group). This was more or less similar to the present Abujhmad region of Chhattisgarh, with police forces hardly having any access to the area. The killing of security forces and Maoists in exchange of fire was a routine affair. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/maoists-cross-a-red-line-again-hteditorial-101617633554928.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Maoists cross a red line, again | HT Editorial</a></b></p><p>After the lifting of the ban on Maoists and talks between the rebels and the then YS Rajasekhar Reddy government in combined Andhra Pradesh in October 2004, things changed in favour of the security forces. Talks failed despite initiatives of civil society groups, but it gave an opportunity to the security forces to access the Nallamala forests to help gain complete control over the region. </p><p>After the failure of talks, the Greyhounds, a specialised force, and other security forces launched an all-out attack on Maoists, based on pointed intelligence, and inflicted heavy casualties. Top Maoist leaders, including Akkiraju Haragopal alias Ramakrishna and Sudhakar, who took part in the talks, fled to Chhattisgarh and Andhra-Odisha borders. Many other top leaders such as Madhav, Shyam, Mahesh, Murali, Chandramouli, Prasad, Patel Sudhakar Reddy and Sakhamuri Appa Rao were killed in encounters. And some other central committee members such as Kobad Ghandy and Malla Raji Reddy were arrested from different parts of the country. </p><p>“Between 2004 and 2009, nearly 400 Maoists, including top leaders and state secretaries were killed in encounters. The Nallamala forests were liberated from Maoists,” a senior police official, who played an active role in the talks with the Maoists in 2004, said. </p><p>The implementation of a socio-economic agenda, coupled with effective police action and field level intelligence, led to the decline in Maoist activity in the then unified Andhra Pradesh after 2005. The setting up of tribal welfare residential schools even in the remotest areas, setting up of health care centres in every panchayat, development of road infrastructure to interior villages, various other programmes through Integrated Tribal Development Agencies (ITDA) and implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme also helped lead to the decline in Maoist activities in Telangana and Andhra districts, bordering Chhattisgarh and Odisha. </p><p>“Young people are not inclined towards Maoists anymore and have become career-oriented. They are looking towards towns and cities, rather than jungles,” observed S Venkatesh, an NGO activist in Bhadrachalam. </p><p><b>Renewed focus on Chhattisgarh </b></p><p>After facing reverses in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, the Maoists began consolidating their position in Chhattisgarh. Although they entered in Chhattisgarh in early 1980s, the region was initially used only as a buffer zone, but since the 1990s, the rebels stepped up their offensive against security forces. </p><p>“Geographically, the Maoists have found Chhattisgarh forests very convenient to gain hold, compared to Telangana and Andhra. They could easily gain the support of the local Adivasis, who were agitated over the plundering of mineral wealth by the big companies with the support of the governments,” Jampanna, the former Maoist leader, said. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-issue-statement-say-their-fight-not-against-security-forces-101617690618172.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Maoists issue statement, say their fight not against security forces</a></b></p><p>There were other factors that enabled the rise of Maoists in the region. </p><p>According to senior police officials, the development strategy adopted by the combined Andhra government (and later Telangana government) did not work out in Bastar district due to a vacuum in administration and poor penetration of developmental agencies. “The massive corruption in the lower-rung revenue and forest officials also led to alienation of tribals,” a police official said. </p><p>Chhattisgarh was also a newly formed state (it was carved out of Madhya Pradesh in 2000) and had limited police strength — there were just about 1,000 policemen in undivided Bastar district. Unlike the Greyhounds of Andhra, the police personnel in Bastar were initially not trained adequately to fight the guerrilla warfare of Maoists. </p><p>And then there was the Salwa Judum experiment, which, by all independent accounts, only deepened alienation among tribal communities in the region and led to human rights violations, providing a fertile ground to the Maoists to recruit and spread their ideology. The Salwa Judum was essentially a counter-insurgency group formed from within Adivasis to take on the Maoists. It was supposed to be a peace mission, and was launched by Mahendra Karma, a former Communist-turned-Congress leader in June 2005. </p><p><b>The failed Judum experiment </b></p><p>Projected as spontaneous uprising of tribals against the violence unleashed by Maoists, the Judum comprised mostly local Koya or Dorla tribes, who are believed to be semi-urban, compared to Muriya or Gothikoya tribes, who live deep inside the forests. While the Gothikoyas had become supporters of Maoists, the Koyas were exploited by the security forces in the name of Salwa Judum. </p><p>Between 2005 and 2010, 644 tribal villages were evacuated and 100,000 brought into the Salwa Judum camps and provided with arms by the police to counter the Maoists. This led to massive armed conflicts between Salwa Judum tribals and Maoists, leading to countless deaths. The Salwa Judum experiment failed subsequently and it had to be wound up following a direction from the Supreme Court in July 2011. Its founder Mahendra Karma was brutally killed by Maoists on May 25, 2013. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maoists-release-photograph-of-missing-cobra-commando-101617780384486.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Maoists release photograph of missing CoBRA commando</a></b></p><p>After the failure of Salwa Judum experiment, the Maoists stepped up their recruitment drive. Top Maoists leaders, mostly from Telangana, mingled with the local tribals and assimilated their distinct culture and tradition.</p><p>The Maoists also started taking care of the needs of the tribals in the deep forests by setting up Janatana Sarkars (people’s governments) in the tribal hamlets, which are essentially local self-governments – they set up schools and banks run by local tribals, created irrigation facilities by constructing check dams on local streams, introduced collective farming and run revenue administration. </p><p>“For the tribals, the Maoists are the real government, since they have not seen any other official coming to them so far. Naturally, they are prepared to lay down their lives for Maoists and fight with the police forces,” a teacher in a Bastar village, who did not want to be named, said. </p><p>The absence of roads and bridges on rivers like Indrawati and its tributaries like Chintavagu and Sabri also helped Maoists isolate villagers for over six months in a year, thus giving them opportunity to “brainwash” the tribals. </p><p>At the same time, the Chhattisgarh Police did not have a specialised anti-Naxal force like the greyhound of Telangana, while Maoists were able to create a specialised army in the form of PLGA with batallions, companies and platoons. Its approach of winning over tribals was coupled with coercion, which took the form of direct attacks on security forces and political leaders, as well as a reign of coercion over people in areas they controlled. </p><p>The most significant Maoist attack on security forces was when they killed 76 CRPF personnel near Chintalnar village in Dantewada on April 6, 2010. A month later, they killed 36 persons, including 12 special police officers in an attack on a bus at Dantewada and 26 more CRPF jawans at Narayanpur on June 29, 2010. </p><p>Earlier, they had killed 55 armed Salwa Judum forces and policemen at Rani Bodli in Bijapur on March 15, 2007 and 30 policemen, including Rajnandagaon superintendent of police, at Madanwada on July 12, 2009. </p><p>In 2013, in one of their most audacious attacks, the Maoists wiped out almost the entire top leadership of the Congress in the state in an attack in Jiram Ghati, killing senior Congress leaders such as Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and VC Shukla. </p><p>In the meantime, Operation Green Hunt, which was believed to have launched in November 2009 by the Central government simultaneously in five states — Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal — but was never officially confirmed, played a role in containing the Maoist movement to a large extent, but it did not completely weaken the left-wing extremism as these attacks showed.</p><p><b>The response from Raipur</b></p><p>Officials believe that the Raman Singh government was more aggressive in tackling Maoists, with a higher number of anti-Naxal operations planned by the police and Central forces during the Bharatiya Janata Party’s rule. But this, civil liberties activists claim, was accompanied by greater human rights violations. </p><p>In 2014, a controversial Inspector General SRP Kalluri was posted in Bastar. While human rights activists alleged that the violation of human rights was at its peak during Kalluri’s tenure, his supporters lauded him as a superhero in containing Maoist activity — and spoke of his strategy of forcing the surrender of Maoists and enhancing the state’s penetration in rural areas. He was subsequently removed from Bastar in 2017. </p><p>The Congress government, led by Bhupesh Baghel, which succeeded the Raman Singh government in December 2018, has claimed that the Maoist violence in the state has gone down. There are two views on this decline. </p><p>On one hand are officials in the field who believe that the decrease in violence in 2019 and 2020 because of the reduced engagement of security forces in core areas with Maoists and “defensive strategy” of forces in the last two years. </p><p>On the other side of the debate are senior police officials who claim this decline is because of a set of measures — including “offensive and intelligence-based operations” by state police and other paramilitary forces; the opening up of new operational base camps in the affected areas which has helped the police regain control over more than 8,000sqkm area in Bastar Range; and policies and programmes to provide employment to tribals of Bastar. </p><p><b>The dip in Maoist strength </b></p><p>According to official figures tabled in the Chhattisgarh state assembly during the recent budget session, there has been a decline in the encounters in the state – from 211 in 2016 to 198 in 2017, 166 in 2018, 121 in 2019 and 84 in 2020. The Maoists have made a tactical retreat due to stepping up of combing operations. </p><p>“The Maoists were also short of funds due to lockdown and demonetisation, and thus wanted road construction and other activities to continue in lieu of levy, so there is a marked decrease in arson,” said an IPS officer posted in Bastar. </p><p>A section of intelligence officials believe that the death of key Maoist leaders like Ramanna due to medical illness and poor health of other ageing top Maoists working in the state have decreased their mobility, thus leading to a vacuum, especially at the level of strategists. Top leaders are not able to move freely as in the past. </p><p>However, despite the widespread sense that the Maoist forces have weakened, the PLGA remains strong. “They still have more than 1,000 automatic weapons looted from policemen,” a senior police official said. </p><p>In the last two years, two serious incidents — the Minpa attack in 2020 and Tarrem in 2021 — occurred when forces were in operations. The PLGA forces rehearsed their ambush plans many times, and when forces arrived, they rearranged themselves in very short time, thus surprising security forces. </p><p>“Although Maoists are now not in a position to attack police camps and police stations as they did in past, they still possess the capability to ambush security forces in their core areas due to their terrain knowledge, village support, civil recce teams leaking all movements of security forces and their fearless lightening attacks,” the police official said. </p><p><b>Is there a way out? </b></p><p>After Saturday’s encounter at Bijapur, Union home minister Amit Shah who called on the injured CRPF jawans at Jagdalur and Raipur declared that the Centre would decisively crush the Maoist movement. </p><p>Experts offer different prescriptions.</p><p>Ramesh Kanneganti, a Hyderabad-based internal security expert and executive director of Centre for Human Security Studies, said, “There is an urgent need to work on more robust state-level and Central-level multi-agency coordination to achieve greater operational and strategic alignment to weed out Maoists. National security and human security approaches should be blended to liquidate the menace with more emphasis on technology and human intelligence merger.”</p><p>Professor G Hara Gopal, rights activist and former professor of Hyderabad Central University, who played a major role in the AP government-Maoist talks in 2004, said the whole problem lies in the Central government dealing with the issue as a “law-and-order problem, instead of socio-economic problem.” </p><p>“As long as the government follows this path, the problem is going continue for a long and there is going to be loss of human life on both sides. This is very unfortunate. There is a need to engage Maoists in dialogue and the government should try to resolve the fundamental issues being raised by them,” he said. He added that there was also a need for a vibrant civil society which should take the initiative in bringing about a dialogue between the government and the Maoists. “Before the 2004 talks, there was a big exercise by such civil society groups, including former IAS officer S R Sankaran. Now, there is no such atmosphere in Chhattisgarh,” he regretted. </p><p>Irrespective of what approach the government adopts, or the mix of strategies it weaves together, the battle against Maoists is entering a new phase in India. The past offers lessons. </p>","<p>Even as the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases reached unprecedented levels, safety protocols and guidelines have gone for a toss in several cities and states.

Members of Manhas’ CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard (DRG), and the Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives in the five-hour-long clash with Maoists at the Sukma-Bijapur border, with reports suggesting that around 20 insurgents were also killed. The Maoists, however, claimed that only four of their cadres were killed.</p><p>“I don’t want anything. I just want my son back. Where is the government? Does the life of a Jawan has no value for this government?”, asked Manhas’ mother, who was among the protestors seeking his release.</p><p>His father in law said, “For this day did we vote for this government? None has come to our rescue. He is our son in law and we want him back. How insensitive can the government be? It’s been four days since he was abducted by the Naxals on Saturday, but no one in the administration has bothered to reach out to us with an assurance”. </p><p>Manhas joined the CRPF in March 2011 and got married in 2014. He has a five-year-old daughter and is the sole bread earner for his family. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh three months back from Assam. Manhas’ family first learnt about his abduction from a Chhattisgarh journalist, who called them to say that the Maoists told him that they had captured Manhas. The ultras, led by one of their top commanders, Mandvi Hidma, are said to have lured the security forces into a U shaped trap in the jungles near the Sukma-Bijapur border. The insurgents decamped with weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and even the shoes of dead soldiers after the ambush. Initial reports had then confirmed that one jawan was reported missing. </p><p>Another relative said Manhas should be freed on priority as was done with the case of IAF wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was released five days following his capture in Pakistan after his MiG-21 Bison was shot down after successfully intercepting a posse of Pakistani fighters over the Line of Control in the Rajouri-Mendhar sector on 27 February 2019, the day after the Balakot strike. Before the IAF pilot ejected from his ageing MiG-21 hit in the aerial dogfight over the skies of Jammu, he shot down a fourth-generation F-16 fighter. He was captured by villagers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he landed and handed over to the Pakistan military. India had warned Pakistan of severe consequences if the fighter pilot was not released unharmed and immediately. Abhinandan was returned on March 1 via the heavily-guarded Wagah-Attari border post.</p><p>“His mother sent him to serve the nation. We are poor people, we don’t have to do anything with politics but if the government could bring back wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan, then why have they been dragging their feet in getting our boy released from the captivity of Maoists,” he asked. </p><p>The protestors in Jammu held tricolours and staged a sit-in at the main town chowk while shouting slogans against the BJP-led Central government and also against Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor (L-G) Manoj Sinha. </p><p>No one from the administration was present there to meet the protesters till the filing of this report. </p>","<p>Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said various Covid-19 vaccination centres in the state do not have enough vaccine doses, and people have to be sent back due to the paucity.

Today, Munger, about 1,200km from Delhi, is no longer a source of concern for the police in the national capital, for the trend of Delhi’s criminals sourcing weapons from Bihar’s infamous factories has dissipated, according to key police officials.</p><p>But that’s where the good news ends. The police have a bigger worry. In Delhi, when, on an average, there are at least two incidents involving the use of firearms in crimes every day, factories have now mushroomed in the vicinity of the capital itself. Those who ran the small arms factories in Munger have now joined hands and trained people in western Uttar Pradesh. HT spoke to many police officers, both retired and serving, to understand the market of illegal gun trade in Delhi. </p><p>The last time Munger’s illegal firearm factories were in the headlines was in March 2020, when a 7.65 bore countrymade pistol was seized from the house of Shahrukh Pathan, the north east Delhi resident whose video of pointing the gun at a policeman during Delhi riots went viral on the internet — the pistol was manufactured in Munger. A year later, the Delhi Police have not been able to arrest the person from whom Pathan had purchased the gun or locate the factory in Munger where it was manufactured, despite multiple visits to the district.</p><p>“This is because illegal gun factories in Munger have got crippled in the last five-six years and those skilled in the trade have shifted themselves to other states. They are now adopting newer strategies to earn their livelihood. In fact, the skilled labourers of those factories are now being hired by gun runners who are operating from Delhi’s neighbourhood such as Meerut and Aligarh,” said a crime branch officer. </p><p><b>From Munger to west UP</b></p><p>Between 2012 and 2015, the Delhi Police’s special cell and crime branch teams would make at least two visits every month to Munger to bust owners of illegal gun factories, arrest gunrunners and people involved in the trafficking chain, following any recovery of illicit firearms in Delhi. These days, the teams hardly visit the district once a year.</p><p>But the use of illicit arms in street crimes such as robbery and dacoity in the national capital, or the numbers of seizure of such guns, has not gone down. What has happened is that manufacturing units have come closer to clients, police officers working on gunrunning rackets said.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-wanted-in-39-criminal-cases-arrested-after-brief-exchange-of-fire-with-police-101617727841384.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Man wanted in 39 criminal cases arrested after brief exchange of fire with police</a></b></p><p>Earlier, illegal gun factories of Munger catered to 60% to 70% of total supply of illicit guns in Delhi and its neighbouring states while Madhya Pradesh’s Khargone, Khandwa, Burhanpur and Dhar were the secondary suppliers. But in the last two-three years, the trend has changed. Gunrunners based in Meerut, Aligarh and a few other places in western Uttar Pradesh are now catering to a majority of the demands of illicit firearms by criminals in Delhi-NCR.</p><p>This is also evident from the fact that Delhi Police and UP Police have been taking action against illegal gun factories and gunrunners in recent times in this area. </p><p>On March 27, the UP Police seized 133 illicit firearms after busting four illegal gun factories and arresting eight gunrunners in Meerut.</p><p>A week before that, Delhi Police arrested five men with three countrymade pistols, which, the men revealed, they had procured from one Aamir Saifi, a gunrunner based in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut. Just five days before their arrest, the same team had seized 10 guns from six arrested persons, including a trafficker of illicit firearms — it was during their questioning that the name of Aamir Saifi as a key supplier of the weapons surfaced. </p><p>Similarly, in June last year, an illegal mini-arms factory with 516 firearm barrels, 10 manufactured pistols, and lots of manufacturing parts, was busted in Aligarh following a joint raid by Delhi’s special cell and Aligarh police.</p><p><b>Decoding the shift </b></p><p>There are various reasons behind the shifting of illegal gun factories from Munger to Delhi’s outskirts. But the primary among them were the non-stop raids, seizures and arrests in Munger by the Bihar police as well as police from other states, and the proximity between the suppliers and the clients, experts as well as police officers from Bihar and Delhi said.</p><p>“The last prominent raid in Munger was carried out last year, when the Delhi Police teams camped in the district for several days to arrest the gunrunner through whom Shahrukh Pathan (mentioned above) had purchased the pistol that he had pointed at a policeman during the Delhi riots. Since then, no state police have carried out any operation in Munger. These days, mostly notices are received from other state police following the arrest of Munger’s illegal gun manufacturers in their states,” said Manavjit Singh Dhillon, superintendent of police (Munger).</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/5-hitmen-part-of-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-arrested-in-north-delhi-101617387844113.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">5 hitmen, part of Lawrence Bishnoi gang, arrested in north Delhi</a></b></p><p>Retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer Ashok Chand said that the Delhi Police’s crackdown on gun factories in Munger started in 2012 following a murder case wherein a man allegedly killed his wife and in-laws using a countrymade pistol that was found to be manufactured in Munger. </p><p>With that information and the fact that a majority of the illegal firearms seized during that period had Munger links, the then police chief Neeraj Kumar directed the special cell and crime branch teams to neutralise the entire nexus, said Chand.</p><p>“For the next three-four years, Delhi and Munger police carried out incessant drives against illegal gun factories, forcing criminals involved in the unlawful trade to shift their bases and adopt newer strategies to run their business,” said Chand.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2018, at least 125 AK-47s, fabricated from parts of weapons presumably phased out or condemned by the army and dumped in its stores in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, reached Bihar’s Munger and then found their way into the hands of Maoists and gangsters. The recovery of many such guns and arrests of some key players grabbed the government’s attention and the national investigation agency (NIA) was roped in to investigate the matter.</p><p>“The crackdown that followed nearly wiped out the deadly arms factories from the district and a majority of the skilled labourers shifted,” said another Delhi Police’s crime branch officer.</p><p><b>The new operational manual </b></p><p>Even as the illegal gun trade from Munger has declined, it has led to dislocation rather — with people involved in the manufacturing, supply and sale of firearms now hiring skilled workers from Munger, and shifting them to places around Delhi, thereby creating newer fabrication hubs, smaller in scale and more dispersed.</p><p>As most of the firearms were caught during their transit, the gunrunners adopted the strategy of looking for safe zones around Delhi. The gunrunners look for low income group neighbourhoods, take houses on rent for three-four months, set up their machines and begin assembling firearms, said deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Sanjeev Kumar Yadav.</p><p>“Many of the gunrunners we have arrested and interrogated in the last two-three years revealed that they hire blacksmiths from Munger skilled in manufacturing sophisticated guns, procure raw materials such as springs, butt and barrels from different places and assemble the guns in their temporary gun factories,” said Yadav.</p><p>Unlike earlier, when gunrunners used to transit bigger consignments from Munger or Madhya Pradesh, suppliers have now become careful and take many precautions while adopting newer ways to smuggle illegal weapons into Delhi. They mostly procure raw materials from their older hubs, and the assemble guns at rented places around Delhi. Deals between clients and supplies are no longer happening in open telephone calls but encrypted mobile applications to avoid police attention and stay away from their radar.</p><p>Analysis of confessional statements reveal that traffickers of illegal firearms avoid taking the border routes which are under close police watch. When railways are used, the operators prefer not to land at the stations located in Delhi but get down at stoppages just before Delhi and from there, use local public transport to enter the city.</p><p>In many cases, women accompany the male carriers and they pose as couples to avoid police attention while travelling in private vehicles or in public transport. Police have also found that hiding the illegal firearms in special cavities created in a car doors or boot is another way of smuggling such weapons.</p><p><b>The costing</b></p><p>Assembling a pistol takes just a day or two and the total investment is between <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,000 and <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>3,000. The gun is finally sold at prices ranging between <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>20,000 and <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>30,000, depending on its quality. </p><p>The high profit margin has made this illegal business lucrative, attracting people who want to become rich overnight, said Chand, who last served in Delhi Police’s crime branch.</p><p>Over a decade ago, the demands of firearms in Delhi and other north Indian states were fulfilled not only by the gunrunners based in Munger or Madhya Pradesh—supplies also came from Pakistan. Earlier, foreign-made firearms, mostly Chinese guns, were in high demand among gangsters and criminals because their quality was seen to be better than the crude pistols manufactured in India’s illegal factories. </p><p>“And it was the reason that even Indian Mujahideen (IM) terrorists had involved themselves in the illegal trade. One illegal firearm manufacturing factory that was set up by IM’s co-founder Yasin Bhatkal was busted by the Delhi Police in 2011. I was on the force then and many such operations were carried out across the country,” said Chand.</p><p>But as the smuggled foreign-made guns were costly and risky to traffick across borders, the gunrunners in India started using good metal and materials to manufacture guns of better quality. </p><p>“Unlike the previous crudely made pistols, the barrels of these sophisticated pistols do not burst after one or two shots or cause injuries to the users,” explained Chand.</p><p><b>The impact on Delhi’s crime scene </b></p><p>Even as the Delhi Police data shows that the use of firearms in crimes in the city has decreased over the past three-four years, on an average, two crimes, in which firearms were used, were reported everyday in this period.</p><p>Police data shows that firearms were used in 672 crimes in 2020 while in 2019 this number was 736. Similarly, there were 897 cases of use of firearms in crimes in 2017 and the number came down to 810 the following year (2018).</p><p>In March 2021 alone, there have been at least 20 cases wherein firearms were used for street crimes such as robbery and snatching or heinous crimes like murder and attempt to murder. On March 25, a group of seven-eight assailants opened fire at a police team at GTB Hospital in their bid to release a jailed gangster. </p><p>On March 23, in a suspected gang rivalry case, four motorcycle-borne assailants fired nearly two dozen bullets in south Delhi’s Dakshinpuri to kill a 31-year-old meat shop owner. Around a week ago, a 45-year-old chartered accountant was shot dead at his under construction building in Adarsh Nagar during a robbery bid. On March 12, two armed men who were out for snatching fired and injured a policeman after he tried to stop their motorcycle and overpower them in Defence Colony area.</p><p>These incidents show that criminals carrying firearms become violent even during snatching a gold chain or a mobile phone. They do not hesitate in firing on the police as well.</p><p>Be it crude or refined, guns continue to be the favourite weapon of criminals, as they are the ultimate display of power for them. There is no better way of defining the stature of a criminal than by mentioning what kind of weapons he posses or uses, says deputy commissioner of police (crime) Chinmoy Biswal, who is also Delhi Police’s spokesperson.</p><p>But Biswal also said that police have launched a massive crackdown on illegal guns and the number of weapons every year is proof of that. </p>","<p>Four municipal corporations in Himachal Pradesh are scheduled to undergo polling on Wednesday.

For 90 minutes, they had been firing relentlessly to break free from an U-shaped ambush that eventually killed 22 personnel.</p><p>Hemant and four members of his team had just shot their way from lower ground onto a hillock and were resting, when they saw Kishore and four members of his team approach from another direction. At the time, around 350 personnel were still trapped by the surprise attack at the borders of Sukma and Bijapur districts.</p><p>They stopped, greeted each other, and chatted for a few minutes. “We had broken the ambush…Kishore bhaiyya and his team were on the hilltop and firing to give us cover. Ten minutes later, Kishore bhaiyya came down with his team and we met near a rock. I told him to keep moving and meet me around 300 metres ahead,” Hemant said.</p><p>It was the last time they saw each other.</p><p>The brothers decided to rendezvous at a small hut nearby that soldiers frequented to drink water. But as Hemant advanced through the gunfire, he found it increasingly difficult to dodge bullets, and was separated from his team. “There was continuous firing from both sides. Maoists were using Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) hence it was not easy to move ahead…I told my brother to move... It was sheer luck that I was not hit and managed to cross the ambush,” Hemant said. But in the frenzy, he could not stop at the hut, and moved ahead.</p><p>When Kishore reached the hut, he stopped for a sip of water, and asked the soldiers present if they had seen Hemant. When they replied in the negative, Kishore determined that his younger brother must have been hit by the Maoists, and decided to go back into the gunfire to rescue him. “The other soldiers requested him not to go in the ambush again, but he told them he has to save his brother,” Hemant said.</p><p>“I should have stopped at the hut, come what may,” he added, filled with regret.</p><p>Around 3pm, Hemant returned to the Terrem camp, where helicopters were rescuing the injured. He waited for his brother, but in vain. Eventually, he asked other soldiers if they had seen Kishore, but no one had. “They told me my brother might be with some other team because all teams were scattered after the ambush,” he said.</p><p>He waited until 9pm, when other soldiers told him that Kishore was asking for him at the hut, and had likely walked back into the attack. Hemant was still hopeful of his elder brother being alive, but on Sunday morning, Kishore’s body was discovered.</p><p>The brothers resided in Cherlapal village of Bijapur district; Hemant joined the DRG in 2012 while his brother was inducted about 18 months earlier. Kishore is survived by his wife, who is pregnant with their first child.</p><p>Senior officials confirmed the events. “Kishore was a brave jawan and was also with me for some time. He went inside the ambush again after not finding his brother and died. This is very painful,” said Abhishek Singh, a deputy superintendent of police in Bijapur district .</p><p>Since Saturday, Hemant hasn’t been able to sleep. “Kishore bhaiyya was brave and ultimate fighter.

We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks. Lavrov said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives. “In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said. “Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.</p><p>Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.</p><p>According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most-affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20.</p><p>Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said: “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation.”</p><p><strong>Did not meet PM</strong></p><p>Lavrov did not have an interaction with the Indian Prime Minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader.

There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions.</p><p>Lavrov said the two sides had also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s Far East and the Arctic, he said.</p><p><strong>Vaccine contracts</strong></p><p>Collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted that the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Make in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Valdimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing.

The allegations followed drama over police investigations into the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the alleged murder of a man linked to the car.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government argued out that the state, for valid reasons, has already withdrawn its general consent to the CBI to carry out investigations in Maharashtra, and that the high court should have remained mindful of this aspect before ordering the probe.</p><p>While the two petitions were filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Singh -- whose accusations and a petition before the high court led to the preliminary inquiry by CBI -- and another petitioner before the high court , Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, have also filed their caveat in the apex court to ensure no order is passed without hearing them. The petitions are yet to be assigned a date of hearing.</p><p>Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the order by the high court asking CBI to conclude a preliminary inquiry within 15 days, making him the most high-profile casualty so far in the twists and turns over the discovery of the explosives and the death of Mansukh Hiran.</p><p>As the row reached the Supreme Court, Nationalist Congress Party leader Deshmukh emphasised that the high court, relying on certain unsubstantiated allegations by Singh, entrusted the probe to an agency “which the state government has the least confidence in”, and that “such processes may well be followed to destabilise the government”.</p><p>“In the annals of judicial history, there has hardly been an occasion when the court has taken the statement made against a sitting minister at face value and proceeded to direct an outside agency, without calling from for a response from the concerned minister, to conduct a preliminary inquiry,” said Deshmukh’s plea, filed through advocate Sudhanshu S Choudhri. The petition, which HT has seen, was settled by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is expected to represent Deshmukh in the apex court.</p><p>Questioning the credentials of CBI, Deshmukh added that, presently, the agency was also being led by an interim director, and the legality of this ad hoc arrangement was already questioned before the Supreme Court.</p><p>He said that the high court should have given sufficient time to the state agencies to carry out the probe at the first instance and only in the case of any lapse should a probe, preferably by a team of officers nominated by the court under its supervision, have been contemplated. But the investigation was handed over to an agency “under the control of the central government”, he added.</p><p>“The court chose not to follow that procedure, thereby showing utter lack of confidence in the state machinery as if every investigating officer lacked the confidence of the court in conducting a fair and impartial inquiry,” read Deshmukh’s petition, which added that this assumption was “unsustainable and without any demonstrable reason”.</p><p>Requesting the court to stay the order, the petition said the chief reason cited by the high court for a CBI probe was that Deshmukh served as the home minister, but now that he has resigned, the state machinery must be allowed to freely conduct its investigation.</p><p>The state government, in its appeal, highlighted that Maharashtra had already ordered a judicial probe into the allegations on March 30 by retired Bombay HC judge KU Chandiwal and that the high court could not have straightaway passed the order of a CBI probe without examining the formal pleadings and submissions of the state.</p><p>The state’s petition added that the accusations by Singh were unsubstantiated and that there was no justification to hand over the probe to the CBI, whose jurisdiction had been ousted by the Maharashtra government by withdrawing its general consent.

Hiran was linked to the vehicle.</p><p>“The agency wanted to verify certain details with all the people concerned in the case who were present at CIU office when Hiran had met Vaze. The agency will verify details and examine the facts,” an NIA officer said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.</p><p>However, a senior Mumbai Police officer contended that the DCP in question visited the CIU office for some other work, and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.</p><p>NIA has so far recorded the statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in the Antilia explosives scare, as well as Hiran’s death case, added the NIA officer.</p><p>On Monday at 11.40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers – while recreating the crime scene in the Hiran death case – took Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT, former Victoria Terminus) after they found during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train from there to Kalwa station on March 4, the day Hiran went missing. A team from Pune’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CSFL) was also present when the crime scene was recreated, and recorded a video of Vaze walking on platform number 4, from where he’d boarded a train around 7pm on March 4.</p><p>Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4, and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case before it was handed over to NIA.</p><p>During its probe, ATS found that Vaze got off at Kalwa railway station and had allegedly contacted Hiran around 8.30pm. They spoke for around 11 minutes, and Vaze allegedly asked him to meet near Ghodbunder Road. However, he requested Hiran to tell his family that he was going to meet an officer named Tawade from Kandivli police station.</p><p>On Monday, NIA officers also took Vaze to Kalwa railway station, where he was made to walk from the platform to the station’s exit. The agency has also taken custody of the CCTV footage of CSMT and Kalwa station, said the officer cited above.</p><p>NIA seized a high-end motorcycle linked to the case from Daman on Monday. A Benelli DSK TNT 600GT, it was registered in Thane in the name of a woman suspected to be close to Vaze.

The President is pleased to appoint Sri Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana, judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from April 24, 2021,” the notification issued by the law ministry stated.</p><p>Justice Ramana was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judge</p><p>With this, both the CJI and the central government have followed the seniority norm, as laid down under the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for judicial appointments. As per the MoP, appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, considered fit to hold the office.</p><p>The speculations around appointment of justice Ramana as the next CJI had ensued in the wake of a formal complaint against him by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the senior judge of influencing the state high court and stalling investigations into the Amaravati land scam case in which the judge’s daughters were also being probed. Jagan contended in a letter to the CJI that the Andhra Pradesh high court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.</p><p>On the day justice Bobde recommended justice Ramana as the top judge, the Supreme Court also issued a short statement about the dismissal of Reddy’s complaint.</p><p>Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu &amp; Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&amp;K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.</p><p>Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held.</p><p>In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.</p>","<p>The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday issued interim orders suspending the elections to the mandal (block) parishads and zilla parishads in the state, which are scheduled to be held on Thursday (April 8). The High Court cited insufficient time for the enforcement of the model code of conduct for its decision.</p><p>A single-judge bench of the High Court, comprising Justice U Durga Prasada Rao, gave the orders after hearing a batch of petitions filed by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jana Sena Party.</p><p>Justice Rao agreed with the contention of the petitioners that the state election commission (SEC) had not followed the Supreme Court orders directing that the model code of conduct should be brought into force at least four weeks before the polling date.</p><p>The HC ordered that the notification issued by newly-appointed SEC Neelam Sawhney on April 1, and all the actions taken thereafter, be withheld. The court did not accept the SEC’s argument that the four-week gap between the notification and polling date for enforcement of the model code of conduct was only a suggestion and not a compulsion.</p><p>Justice Rao posted the case to April 15 for further hearing and directed the SEC to file a counter by then. It also asked the SEC to follow the Supreme Court guidelines on the enforcement of the model code of conduct for four weeks before the polling date.</p><p>An official in the state government said the SEC was contemplating challenging Justice Rao’s interim order by filing an emergency petition before a division bench late in the evening or Wednesday morning.</p><p>Sawhney, who replaced Nimmgadda Ramesh Kumar as the SEC on April 1, announced the schedule for the conduct of mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) within hours of taking charge.</p><p>As per the schedule, the polling will be held on April 8 and the results will be declared on April 10. Since the polling process commenced in March 2020, before it was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19, there was no need for the issuance of fresh notification, Sawhney said.</p><p>In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which as many as 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020. As per the schedule announced on April 1, the campaigning came to an end by 4 pm on Tuesday.</p><p>The opposition parties found fault with the SEC for hurriedly announcing the schedule without following the SC guidelines on the model code of conduct. The TDP said it would boycott the elections, alleging the ruling YSR Congress party of trying to bulldoze the election process with the help of the SEC and the police machinery. </p>","<p>As India faces the worst wave of the Covid-19 pandemic yet, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and chief ministers of several states have appealed to the central government to open vaccination for all people above 18, even as Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan resorted to semantics in the health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday, saying “the aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.</p><p>Experts pointed out that in the case of the coronavirus disease, no one is safe till everyone is safe – and in this case this means everyone over the age of 18 (neither of the vaccines in use in India has yet been approved for those below the age of 18). Other experts pointed that even if vaccines must be administered in a prioritised manner, it would make sense to prioritise urban centres, especially those that are seeing a huge surge in infections.</p><p>“In cities, if we immunise about 30-40% (given that 45-55% have been infected), we should be in reasonable shape and begin to see slowing. However, there are lots of caveats such as duration of protection, variant escape, etc. In rural areas, we will need greater coverage to see a difference. But ultimately we will need to get everyone immunised including children,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologist.</p><p>In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, IMA said: “At present, we are vaccinating the population above 45 years. In view of the rapid spread of the second wave of the disease, we suggest that our vaccination strategy needs to be geared up with immediate effect. All citizens above 18 years of age shall be permitted to receive Covid vaccination.”</p><p>Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote a similar letter to the PM, seeking removal of the age bar on vaccination. “I appeal to the Prime Minister and the Central government to allow the vaccination for all by removing the age bar,” the letter read. “Also, in addition to the two vaccines currently being used in India, other vaccines should be allowed, so that more and more people can be vaccinated in the earliest possible manner,” it added.</p><p>India is expected to approve the Sputnik V vaccine shortly.</p><p>Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, and his Maharashtra and Delhi counterparts, Uddhav Thackeray and Arvind Kejirwal, have made similar appeals to the Centre. On Monday, Kejriwal wrote to the Prime Minister, saying “if rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months.”</p><p>India has so far administered 84 million vaccine doses till Tuesday night, according to HT’s vaccine tracker. Of this, 10,904,088 people have received both doses and 62,257,181 have received one dose. On Monday, the country vaccinated 4,300,966 people, a new high. According to an HT analysis last week, if India vaccinates 4 million people a day, it would have completely vaccinated 50 million people (both doses) by May 15 and 100 million people by June 16. It takes two weeks after the second dose for the vaccine to be completely effective.</p><p>On Tuesday, India added a record 115,320 new cases in a single day, taking its overall tally of cases to 11,789,781; 630 people died from Covid-10 on Tuesday. The current seven-day average of cases is 93,041.</p><p>IMA has also suggested that private sector family clinics should be included actively in the vaccination drive along with private hospitals. Making vaccination certificate mandatory for entering public places and to receive products under the public distribution system were among the several suggestions made by the doctors’ body as ways to dispel vaccine hesitancy.</p><p>In the health ministry briefing, Bhushan sought to explain the rationale for the government’s phased approach to vaccination.</p><p>“It is a common question that is being asked these days that why are not Covid-19 vaccinations being opened for all; why can’t all adults be given it. To those, I want to say that Covid-19 vaccination drive is essentially meant to serve two purposes: to prevent deaths and the other purpose is to protect your health care system. In the middle of a pandemic, the main aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. The most vulnerable in the country have to be protected, and that is what is being done globally also,” said Bhushan.</p><p>“The basic aim is to reduce death through vaccination. The other aim is to protect your healthcare system. If healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics and others fall sick, who will work in hospitals? So the aim, for any country, is to protect those who are the most vulnerable,” he said.</p><p>Bhushan later told ANI it was “a fallacy that our vaccination process is heavily regulated and controlled by the state”.</p><p>Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said: “What we know so far is that all vaccines that are being used, including the two being used in ,India reduce mortality, severity of the disease, protect lives and keeping that in mind priority groups have been decided. We have to protect our most vulnerable.” He said the priority groups have been decided based on people vulnerable to mortality.</p><p>“Pandemic situation no doubt has deteriorated in the country, as there has been a serious rise in Covid-19 cases. It has risen like a wave, and this time the speed of rise is greater than the previous time,” said Paul.</p><p>India’s vaccine drive began on January 16 with health care workers, and on February 2 with frontline workers, and then moved, on March 1, to people over the age of 60 and those over the age of 45 but with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.</p><p>On April 1, the country started vaccinating everyone over the age of 45.</p>","<p>US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, called on India to join hands with the US to confront the climate crisis through a clean energy transition.</p><p>“Our two nations, the world’s two biggest democracies have a great deal to gain by joining hands and global leadership to confront climate change now. We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of President Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held on April 22-23.</p><p>“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry.

He also acknowledged the US’ role in historical emissions leading to the climate crisis.</p><p>“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours. Instead of building a modern and sustainable society that can be the envy of the world, some of us have contributed too much to the problem that we are living through today. We are working to build back better today in the US, to transform our economy in a way that prevents the impending climate crisis by keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees C and also create cutting edge jobs of the future,” he said.</p><p><b>Also read: ‘<a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-hot-investment-us-envoy-john-kerry-lauds-india-s-energy-policy-101617717156550.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Red hot investment’ - US Envoy John Kerry lauds India’s energy policy</a></b></p><p>But Kerry also underlined the need for a quicker clean energy transition and phasing out of coal. “India has an advantage that we didn’t have in the US. Not just the benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement but you also have the US as your friend and partner. We are here to support you on this path. India’s global leadership has been critical on a range of issues including delivering covid vaccines to the world. But I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies,” he said.</p><p>While lauding PM Modi’s announcement of achieving the target of 450 GW renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said it’s cheapest to build solar in India and that he wants to see India as the cleantech hub of Asia. “The International Energy Agency (IEA) special report said you (India) are on pace to become the global market leader on solar and storage by 2040. It’s already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need to confront global climate change. We are in the decisive decade for action,” Kerry stated.</p><p>Kerry said a zero-emissions future holds huge business opportunity. Global investment in new clean power capacity is said to exceed 10 trillion dollars through mid-century, more than 6 times the investment in dirtier options. “Still a net-zero energy transition will require innovation and scaling up. It’s critical that the US, India and other partners build the enhanced clean industries of the future - decarbonised industries… In 2021 we have a rare opportunity to create new technologies and new markets and India is seizing this opportunity,” Kerry said, adding that India could add half a million additional jobs by 2030 if it pursues clean energy transition aggressively.</p><p>Underling the urgency of the climate crisis, Kerry said to get where we need to go according to the Paris Agreement and as per the scientists to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees C, we need to phase out coal five times faster than we have been, we need to increase tree cover five times faster, ramp up renewable energy six times faster.</p><p>According to senior environment ministry officials, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its GHG emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the United States (US) on an “irreversible path” to a net-zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.</p><p>“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country, especially for a lower-middle-income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need several technologies to become better and cheaper - energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieving any net-zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India’s needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on the infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute.</p>","<p>The Union health ministry on Tuesday warned that Covid-19 is spreading at a faster rate in the country compared to last year.

Now, the Congress, for the first time in 36 years, faces crucial elections without him at 24 Akbar Road, the party headquarters. </p><p>Coping with a political life without Patel, the party finds itself amid a new chain of command and the rise of younger strategists. The new era also coincides with a bunch of senior leaders being sidelined over the “letter controversy” last year. A group of 23 senior leaders, casually identified as G23, wrote to Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanding sweeping changes in the way the party functions. </p><p>For many, this vacuum has also led to, to a large extent, the decentralisation of the party’s poll tactics. </p><p>Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel, 59, and former union minister Jitendra Singh (49) are handling the Assam elections this year. Party functionaries claim this team handled the entire poll strategy, including the alliances, without any significant intervention from the high command, as the Congress top leadership, primarily comprising the Nehru-Gandhi family, is known in party circles. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deshmukhs-exit-the-start-of-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-alliance-s-troubles-101617650895094.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Deshmukh’s exit: The start of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance’s troubles?</a></b></p><p>The Congress sent Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot to Kerala and, in a first, party general secretaries KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala were the initial emissaries for seat negotiations in Tamil Nadu. </p><p>Yes, there are poll observers such as Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan or BK Hariprasad. “But if Ahmed Patel was alive, there would invariably be a strategy centre at the 15, Gurdwara Rakabganj Road with one of the three offices dedicated to him,” said a senior Congress leader. In previous elections, Patel was a perennial presence in the Congress war room where he met strategists, took stock of the situation, identified challenges, handled the vital issue of funds, and duly reported back to Sonia Gandhi. </p><p>But now, as a second party leader said, “The lion’s share of the election planning is taking place at the state level. New, younger people have taken responsibility.”</p><p>To be sure, it doesn’t mean that the new strategists are on auto-pilot mode. The poll-bound party is firmly in the hands of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. Last month, when the seat-sharing talks between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress came to a standstill in Tamil Nadu, it was Sonia Gandhi who called DMK chief MK Stalin to finalise the pact. According to one of her confidants, she still decides several issues such as party’s Rajya Sabha nominees or the negotiations with allies. </p><p>But Sonia Gandhi, according to the two senior leaders quoted above, is yet to come to terms with Patel’s untimely death, and the party has not found his substitute who would be her eyes and ears and can handle any crisis situation, as he had done for decades. </p><p>Examples abound of Patel’s legendary political skills. </p><p>From garnering votes for the 2008 trust vote triggered by the India-United States nuclear deal to managing the United Progressive Alliance partners (he was the strongest link between Sonia Gandhi and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee), Ahmed Patel did it all. He would meet Pranab Mukherjee, then the number two in the cabinet, almost every week after midnight (Mukherjee’s favourite time for leisurely conversations) to tackle issues or even reach out to outside supporters such as Left or Mulayam Singh Yadav on behalf of Sonia Gandhi. </p><p>In September 2013, when Rahul Gandhi dubbed an ordinance cleared by union cabinet as “complete nonsense” while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was in the United States, Sonia called Patel and asked him to devise the party’s public response. </p><p>Or, when the Congress decided to organise its first rally near Jantar Mantar against the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s amendments to the land bill in 2015, a host of leaders called up the young organisers to ensure their slots as speakers. “When we went to invite Patel, he asked us if have had sufficient funds to organise the rally,” said an AICC member. </p><p>Along with Kamal Nath and Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Patel was instrumental in managing funds for the party. He was an austere man without a flashy lifestyle who always sat in the front seat of his ambassador. </p><p>In Patel’s absence, his domain areas have been distributed among a host of leaders— further suggesting decentralisation. Venugopal, a close aide of Rahul, is overseeing all organisational issues. Former railway minister Pawan Bansal has replaced Patel as the treasurer of the Congress. And other leaders such as Jairam Ramesh or Surjewala play important roles in party management. </p><p>But the party is struggling to fill the void left by Patel’s death. According to a senior strategist and a fellow member of Rajya Sabha, his death is perhaps the biggest blow for the Congress in the recent times after the loss of two national elections. </p>","<p>The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has virtually trained over 4,000 government officials in cyber safety in the last three months, in the wake of an increase in such attacks, officials familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. </p><p>The course, which started in December last, offers two variants — a one-day basic training to avoid cases of cyber breaches and digital sanitisation, and a five-day deep dive into the technical aspects of the same. Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Hyderabad is the implementing agency for both the training programmes. “More government officials are increasingly applying for the course,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “We aim to try and train all government employees in the course of six months.” </p><p>HT, last month, reported several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks.The discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access to sensitive networks, underscores the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure.</p><p>The training includes information security at the organisational level, cyber ethics and details of cyber offences, data, passwords and email security, mobile security, mobile app security and social engineering attacks. The initial six to eight hours, which constitute the basic training, also cover social networking security and secured financial transactions. A 1,000 participants can be trained during the webinar, according to the course document accessed by HT. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-plans-tougher-security-measures-for-300k-govt-officials-101616989711350.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Centre plans tougher security measures for 300k govt officials</a></b></p><p>The advanced session, officials said, had fewer takers.

The programme includes information security audit and assessments including various cyber security threats and incident response. This session is more focused and has 10 participants during one course. </p><p>The country has seen a sharp spike in the number of cyber incidents across different sectors. As per the information reported to and tracked by Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), 17,560, 24,768 and 26,121 Indian websites were hacked during the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, the ministry told the Rajya Sabha on March 18 in response to an unstarred question. </p><p>“According to the logs analysed and made available to CERT-In, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the computers from where the attacks appear to be originated belong to various countries including Algeria, Brazil, China, France, Indonesia,Netherlands, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey,USA, Vietnam, etc,” the ministry had said. </p><p>Union minister of state for MeitY Sanjay Dhotre also told the Parliament that in the last six months, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rise in scanning and malware infections across sectors.</p><p>A total of 110, 54, and 59 websites of Central ministries, departments, and state governments were hacked in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, the minister said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.</p><p>HT, on March 5 reported that cyber operations by state actors and the abuse of social media for “narrative warfare” are some of the particular threats likely to be recognised by the government in the National Cyber Security Strategy, 2021 (NCSS 2021), a policy paper that could also make it mandatory for any business or government department with a significant IT interface to set up a cyber safety cell.</p><p>This will be part of a long-awaited overhaul in how India sees and approaches dangers in the digital domain. India’s current posture stems from the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, which officials and experts say has become outdated in the face of a threat landscape that affects national security, governance and critical infrastructure, communications, and business more deeply than ever.</p><p>Over the last couple of years, India has also faced several high-profile cyber attacks, including those purportedly originating in North Korea that targeted the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in 2019. Earlier this week, security consultants reported finding a China-backed operation to target India’s electricity grid.</p><p>Subimal Bhattacharjee, an independent consultant on defence and cyber issues, said that the online cyber security training for government employees is desirable and should be pursued with more vigour. “This is a good step by the government to sensitise basics to all employees and also have a special course of technical staff of every ministry/department,” he said. “At the same time, the employees also should be trained about they should keep their official and government online platforms separately and have well defined access control to official networks. More number of employees should be motivated to undertake these courses and keep on updating themselves after the courses periodically.”</p>","<p>India’s daily rise in the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday remained over 90,000 for the third consecutive day as 96,982 infections were reported in the last 24 hours from across the country, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare.

He said if the BJP wins it is considered an election-winning machine but if others win then that is credited to their hard work. “The BJP is not the election-winning machine, those who say this could never understand the democracy of this country and hopes, dreams, expectations of the people of this country,” the Prime Minister said.</p><p>The Prime Minister said the BJP works for the development of the nation but the opposition has used the game of secularism and communalism against the party. Incorrect narratives are constructed against the government, Modi said citing examples of the farm laws, Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and labour laws.</p><p>The Prime Minister urged the party workers to be aware and spread awareness among the people against this large conspiracy that the opposition is playing against the BJP to create political instability in the nation, through spreading lies and rumour-mongering. “Parties that began with help from local aspirations, became a family-based party later. These parties, who were wearing a mask of secularism, are finally being unmasked,” he said.</p><p>“The BJP means defeating dynasty-based politics.

Because of the new wave of outbreaks in India right now, the Indian government has stepped up their vaccination programmes, and that has meant that they've required more doses, which means that they've made fewer doses available for the rest of the world,” Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi told CBS News in an interview.</p><p>“We had expected, in March and April, about 90 million doses, and we suspect we'll get much, much less than that, and that is a problem,” he said.</p><p>Gavi Alliance is a public-private partnership that works to provide vaccines for developing countries. It provides about 50 per cent of the world's children with vaccines.</p><p>“But we're in a race because we also see wealthy countries beginning to cover much of their population. Our hope is that they will begin to make their vaccines available to the rest of the world, including ones that they may not use. For example, the US not only has Moderna, Pfizer, and J&amp;J, but they also have vaccines from Novavax and, of course, from AstraZeneca,” Berkley said.</p><p>“Those could be made available, and they would make a big difference in terms of the supply for the world,” he said.</p><p>Berkley said that the big challenge right now is access to vaccines.</p><p>""We have gone ahead and placed orders for more than two billion doses, but the majority of those are coming in the second half of the year. And in the first half of the year, vaccine nationalism has meant that there are fewer doses available. So that's our big challenge now. If we had more doses, we could make those available,” Berkley said.</p><p>Responding to a question, Berkley said that what it is talking about now is ultimately getting access to the large manufacturing facilities.</p><p>“I mean the US invested heavily at the beginning, and scaled-up manufacturing, and invested again and scaled up. Once the US needs are met, those facilities really could be used to come online for the rest of the world, which could help stop the acute pandemic. Our goal would be by the end of this year to stop the acute pandemic, which is critical for global health security,” he said.</p><p>Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan last month said that India has provided over 481 lakh doses of coronavirus vaccines to various countries, out of which 73.5 lakh doses have been supplied as grant assistance, 288.4 lakh on a commercial basis and 119.16 lakh doses for Cova.</p><p>India recorded an all-time high of 1,03,558 single day new coronavirus infections, pushing the nationwide tally to 1,25,89,067, according to the Union Health Ministry data on Monday.

Out of the 205 candidates in the race, only 13 are women. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has deployed more than 62,000 central armed police personnel for the third phase. </p><p>Like the second phase, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) will be enforced around the 10,871 polling booths in the three districts on Tuesday to stop assembly of more than four people. </p><p>The number of electors in the third phase is 78,52,425 of whom a little less than half are women while 243 belong to the third gender. </p><p>In Hooghly district, where eight seats go to the polls, the BJP made sizeable inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The TMC has fielded Sujata Mondal Khan, the estranged wife of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state president and Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan from this seat.

I have felt the tension in some areas,” Sarkar, who could not win in 2019, told HT on Monday night. </p><p>In Hooghly district, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), is contesting only the Arambagh and Tarakeshwar seats. </p><p>In South 24 Parganas district, where as many as 16 assembly segments are going to the polls, several are part of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. The TMC’s youth wing president held five rallies and roadshows as campaigning came to a close at 5 pm on Sunday. </p><p>The district, with 31 assembly constituencies, is a TMC stronghold. In the 2016 state polls, the ruling party won 29 seats. In 2019, when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats and even made a dent in the adjacent North 24 Parganas district, voters in South 24 Parganas remained loyal to the TMC. Abhishek Banerjee won from Diamond Harbour for the second time by a margin of 3,00,000 votes. </p><p>Muslims comprise a sizeable section of the population in many assembly segments such as Canning East, Baruipur East, Baruipur West and Diamond Harbour. While this may make the contest easier for the TMC, since Muslims have backed the party consistently, allegations of corruption during distribution of relief for victims of cyclone Amphan has been made the main election issue by the BJP and the Indian Secular Front founded by cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui. </p><p>Magrahat East, Bishnupur, Mandirbazar, Joynagar, Basanti, Kultali and Canning West are reserved for scheduled caste candidates. In these seats, the Left parties had a strong presence till 2016 and the Marxists are desperate to make a comeback. At Raidighi, CPI(M) stalwart and former minister Kanti Ganguly, is contesting the seat again. </p><p>The CPI(M) is contesting nine seats in South 24 Parganas, including Kultali which witnessed violence in almost all elections in the past. On Monday evening, BJP and TMC workers exchanged allegations of violence at Kultali. </p><p>In Howrah, where the TMC has a strong presence, only seven seats are going to the polls. Out of these, the BJP intends to put up a tough fight at Udaynarayanpur, Jagatballavpur, Uluberia North and Uluberia South although the size of the Muslim population in these zones can make things difficult for the saffron camp. </p><p>Actress Tanushree Chakraborty, who joined the BJP in March, has been fielded from Shyampur. </p><p>The ECI has organised the International Virtual Election Visitors Programme (IEVP) 2021 for foreign election management bodies during the elections in four states and Puducherry on Tuesday. </p><p>“The ongoing elections in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have an electorate of over 187.2 million, one of the largest in the world to vote so far amid the Covid-19 pandemic.

How about responsibility of the CM? Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral responsibility to govern,” Prasad said addressing a press conference.</p><p>In the resignation letter Deshmukh posted on Twitter, he said that he doesn’t find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the high court order against him.</p><p>In March, Singh, in a letter to Thackeray alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>100 crore per month from hotels and bars. Singh sent the letter to Thackeray after being transferred to Home Guards, a “low-key” post after mishandling of the case related to explosives being found near Mukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai in February-end. Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in the same case and is also being probed in connection with the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran whose car was found near Ambani’s residence.</p><p>Prasad questioned CM’s silence on the entire issue. “When will CM Udhhav Thackeray speak? The consistent, conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is itself raising a lot of questions...,” he said.</p><p>State BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis too attacked Thackeray. “Why is the chief minister mum? His silence is unsettling.” After the HC order, Fadnavis said, “Truth will come out in the preliminary inquiry. It is improper for Deshmukh to continue as minister after the HC order...”</p><p>After the HC order, Deshmukh met NCP president Sharad Pawar and expressed his desire to step down as he felt it was inappropriate to continue in office, NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik said. “Deshmukh went to hand over the letter to Thackeray after Pawar gave his “green signal” to quit,” said Malik. Singh’s allegations are baseless but the party respects the court and hence the minister has quit, Malik said.</p><p>NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil has been given the charge of the home department.</p><p><em>With PTI inputs</em></p>","<p>India should “undoubtedly” be part of international efforts to find a settlement to the situation in Afghanistan as it is an “important player” in such endeavours, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said.</p><p>In an interview ahead of his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar in New Delhi on Tuesday, Lavrov also said Russia expects India and china to find “mutually acceptable political and diplomatic ways” to remove their differences at the earliest.</p><p>Lavrov also outlined Russia’s priorities for engagements with India during the year, including the annual summit to be held in India and other engagements.</p><p><strong>With India and Russia set to resume high-level engagements after the Covid-19 crisis, what will be the priorities for bilateral agenda in 2021?</strong></p><p>Russia is satisfied with the vigorous political dialogue with India on all levels that keeps on actively developing despite serious restrictions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, we managed to successfully organise several events in face-to-face and online formats. Summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) – a new type of multilateral associations where our countries cooperate fruitfully – are among them.</p><p>This year, New Delhi holds Brics chairmanship – we wish our Indian friends every success and are willing to contribute in every possible way in this regard. India has also joined the activities of the UN Security Council as its non-permanent member. We intend to continue close interaction within the mentioned forums as well as other international platforms.</p><p>We hope that the epidemiological situation would allow us to organise a bilateral summit in 2021. The dates of next sessions of the Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation, Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military and Technical Cooperation and Inter-Parliamentary Commission are under consideration.</p><p>Given the need to overcome negative consequences of the pandemic for the world and national economies, our definite priorities include intensification of the Russian-Indian practical cooperation in areas such as trade, energy, agriculture, transport, finance and banking, science and technology, humanitarian ties.</p><p>I am convinced that the negotiations with my colleague Dr Subramaniam Jaishankar during my visit to New Delhi will promote further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership that unites us.</p><p><strong>During your recent visit to China, did you come away with any fresh insights from your interactions with the Chinese leadership regarding India-China relations? How does Russia currently see its relations with India and China, especially in view of Moscow’s efforts to help reduce tensions related to the border standoff in Ladakh?</strong></p><p>We are closely watching the process of normalisation at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), functioning as the India-China border. We welcome the agreements reached after the telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of India and China on February 25, 2021, aimed at resolution of the situation.</p><p>We highly appreciate the constructive approach demonstrated by both sides. We pay due respect to the intentions of New Delhi and Beijing to act independently and within the frameworks of established multilayer bilateral dialogue mechanisms, without interference from outside. We expect both states as responsible members of the international community to find mutually acceptable political and diplomatic ways to remove existing differences at the earliest.</p><p><strong>Russia has acknowledged India’s interests in Afghanistan and in efforts to find a solution to the situation in Afghanistan. However, India was not part of the recent “extended Troika” meeting in Moscow, and some even speculated this was done at the behest of Pakistan. What role does Russia see for India in efforts to find a settlement in Afghanistan?</strong></p><p>India is an important player in the settlement in Afghanistan and undoubtedly should be engaged in international efforts supporting the Afghan national reconciliation.</p><p>New Delhi is not a participant of the extended “Troika” on Afghanistan, in the framework of which Moscow hosted intra-Afghan consultations on March 18 aimed at facilitation of the launch of peace process in the country. At the same time India is part of the Moscow format uniting the neighbouring states of Afghanistan, key regional countries and the USA. Such a composition allows to coordinate the assistance to national reconciliation process based on broad regional consensus. As the Afghan peace process moves forward, we are planning to resume the work of this mechanism.</p>","<p>When Covid-19 vaccination kicked off in Odisha on January 16, at Bhubaneswar’s Capital Hospital, Biranchi Naik, a 51-year-old sanitation worker, was the most photographed person. Naik, a sweeper working with the hospital for last 30 years, was the first recipient of Covid vaccine in the state, and expectedly, the media and the government made a fuss around him.</p><p>Beyond the glare of TV cameras, an early milestone in the drive was when renowned doctor and medicine specialist, Chinmay Bijay Kumar Mohanty, 65, who is now serving as Odisha’s director of medical education and training, walked into the vaccination room at the hospital, and said he wanted to volunteer as an early recipient.</p><p>He lifted the left arm of his half-sleeved shirt, and a nurse administered the Covaxin shot.</p><p>“There was no pain whatsoever, much lesser than what one would experience after getting a shot of Tetanus toxoid.

Almost all my friends have taken the shot after my prodding -- not even a single close friend is left so far. They know that, being a doctor, I have not been carried away by the publicity surrounding the vaccine. If we compared the side effects of vaccines for Measles, Diptheria, Rabies, Mumps, Tetanus and Influenza with Covid, it is much safer,” he said.</p><p>Several other doctors, including the director of Capital Hospital, Dr Laxmidhar Sahu, neurosurgeon Dr Ashok Mohapatra, and director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar, Dr Gitanajali Batmanbane, also took the shot on the first day. A little over 16,000 health care workers in the state were vaccinated on January 16.</p><p>Mohanty said he never had any doubts about the need to get the shot, even though he had already been infected with Covid-19. “In my 40-year-old medical career, I was never hospitalised. But in October last year, I got Covid, and spent 10 days in ICU. Being a doctor, I know the benefits of a vaccine. I am have mild diabetes and cholesterol. So I was waiting for it; I consider myself lucky that I was among the first doctors to take it on Day 1.

But people should trust doctors. We are living in a world where there will always be microorganisms. We have to survive among them, and fight with the harmful ones. A vaccine is our best hope of fighting such pathogens and we should fight with a positive hope,” he said.</p><p>A common question people ask, Mohanty says, is which shot is better, Covaxin or Covishield.

Both the central and state governments have been jointly making inroads (into Maoist strongholds). Therefore, such incidents came to the fore out of their (Maoists’) frustration,” Shah said.</p><p>“On the development front, too, several works have been done. Although due to Covid-19, the pace slowed down a little, but I believe that action is being taken on all suggestions received from tribal public representatives, the Chief Minister and MPs from the state,” he added.</p><p>He said the central and state governments have been working on both fronts – to expedite the development work in tribal areas and intensified action against the ultras.</p><p>Prime Minister Modi has already fixed the priority to take this fight to a logical end, he said. Chief minister Baghel said more steps will follow in the future to counter Maoism in the state. “In the last few years, we have managed to establish camps in their core area and more camps will be opened soon. The development works will also be accelerated in the area,” Baghel said.</p><p>After paying tribute to the security personnel, the CM said the government was with the families of the martyred jawans.</p><p>Intelligence inputs showed that between 12 and 20 Maoists may have been killed in the encounter.</p><p>One jawan was still missing after the attack, an official said on condition of anonymity.

This number was lower than the 103,769 recorded a day before, but this could largely be due to a fall in testing that is typical of weekends. India is now recording the highest number of cases in a day in the world and has surpassed the first wave peak in September when the number stayed under 100,000.</p><p>Maharashtra has accounted for well over 50% of new Covid cases in the country every day over the past week, with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and West Bengal also reporting a spurt in cases.</p><p>Unlike April of 2020, there are only few places where complete lockdowns have been announced: Durg in Chhattisgarh has imposed a nine-day lockdown that begins April 6.

We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get a vaccine when eligible,” the epidemiologist said in a tweet.</p><p>In Delhi, where the government has ordered hospitals to keep more beds for Covid-19 patients, hospitals said the situation is concerning. “The cases are rising exponentially.

Through January, February and March, La Nina, a global meteorological phenomenon was prevailing which is associated with colder winters and generally milder temperatures. But this year’s warming trend has possibly overshadowed the cooling effect of La Nina.</p><p>“One of the main reasons for record high temperatures being recorded since January is scanty rains. When there is less rain air is dry and warm,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.</p><p>“It’s difficult to say why temperatures are so high despite La Nina conditions being moderate. La Nina has started weakening now. It is (the impact of) climate change signature on temperature patterns. You can see that temperatures in the south peninsula didn’t rise as much because of clouding and rain,” OP Sreejith, scientist, climate monitoring and prediction group had said in March about warmer than usual winter.</p><p>For April, IMD has forecast high probability of above normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of northwest, north along the plains of Himalayas, east, west and central India and below normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of south Peninsular India, northeast India and few subdivisions of extreme north India.</p><p>Western disturbance (WD) activity in March was higher than normal as a total of 7 WDs moved across Western Himalayan Region against the normal of four WDs. Out of 7 WDs, 3 WDs were very active and had moved as a cyclonic circulation but rainfall over the country as a whole for March was 16.7 mm, which is 45% less than its Long Period Average (LPA) of 30.4 mm. Week by week rainfall data in March 2021 shows that consecutively past four weeks in the season, India recorded deficient rainfall over the entire country.</p><p>All three active WDs, however, caused scattered to fairly widespread rainfall and thunderstorm activity over Western Himalayan region during the period and movement of these systems to eastward and formation of its induced cyclonic circulation over northwest Rajasthan in association with these WDs, caused isolated to scattered rainfall/thunderstorm activity over adjoining plains of northwest India during the same period. Dust raising strong surface winds prevailed during March 30 to 31 over parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh.</p><p>In March, moderate La Niña conditions were prevailing over equatorial Pacific and Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) were below normal over central &amp; eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p><p>ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.</p>","<p>A Sikh security personnel removed his turban to tie it around the wound of a fellow jawan who was injured in the deadly Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh that left 22 personnel dead on Saturday, an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer has said.</p><p>Balraj Singh, a commando of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s elite Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) wing, who helped his colleague Abhishek Pandey, also sustained injuries in the firing, R K Vij, a 1988 batch IPS officer in Chhattisgarh, said.

Though French law does not set out precise limits, legal precedents suggest that giving a watch or an expensive meal costing several hundred euros can be enough to constitute corruption,” the Mediapart report said.</p><p>It said to justify the “gift”, Dassault supplied the AFA with a “proforma invoice” of March 30, 2017, which was given by an Indian company called Defsys Solutions. “This invoice, which related to 50% of the total order (€1,017,850), was for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of €20,357,” Mediapart said, quoting the AFA report.</p><p>According to the French report, AFA questioned Dassault, but the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries.</p><p>The Mediapart report claimed that Defsys belongs to the Gupta family, whose members have acted as middlemen in the aeronautical and defence industries for three generations. It said two Indian media reports from January 2019 revealed that one family member, Sushen Gupta, who operated as an agent for Dassault, worked on the Rafale contract and allegedly obtained confidential documents from India’s Ministry of Defence. Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.</p><p>ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VIP helicopters for use by top political leaders, including the President, the Prime Minister, and former PMs. The deal was cancelled in early 2014 over allegations of wrongdoing. Among the people named in the charge sheets filed by ED is Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath.</p><p>Referring to the Mediapart article, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “Was the payment of €1.1 million shown by Dassault as ‘gifts to clients’ in reality a commission paid to middleman for the Rafale Deal? How can ‘middleman’ and ‘payment of commission’ be permitted in a ‘government to government defence contract’ or in any defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory defence procurement procedure?”</p><p>Arguing that the latest media report vitiated the Rafale deal, Surjewala said the revelation entailed imposition of heavy financial penalties on Dassault, banning of the company, registration of an FIR and other penal consequences.</p><p>“Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India’s biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government?” the Congress said, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would answer to the nation on this.</p><p>After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless. The Supreme Court, CAG found nothing wrong [in the deal].”</p><p>This is not Mediapart’s first article on the deal.</p><p>In October 2018, it raised questions about the offset contract that was part of the Rafale deal. It said a senior official in Dassault Aviation saw the partnership with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as “imperative and mandatory” to getting the “export contract” with India for the Rafale aircraft.</p><p>After the latest article, the Congress has demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland.</p><p>The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe.</p><p>Union minister Prasad said, “Is Congress again talking about Rafale? It lost case in Supreme Court. The CAG has also rejected the charges. In 2019 polls they displayed Rafale models everywhere and said so much against the PM. Yet, the lost the polls.”</p><p>“I had once said that Rahul Gandhi doesn’t do his homework. It now looks like the Congress spokespersons also don’t do it. As you all know corporate rivalry goes on in France. But the most interesting thing is that the article mentions Sushen Gupta. Who is Gupta? He was arrested over Agusta Westland in 2019 by our government. And the name of (Gandhi) family members came up in Agusta Westland case. And (former foreign minister) Salman Khurshid has publicly acknowledged that he knows Gupta’s family. So, I want to tell the Congress to do proper homework before you speak,” said Prasad.</p><p>The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).</p><p>The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.</p><p>The Supreme Court heard a publc interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India audited the deal and said India had not overpaid for the jets. </p>","<p>RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Monday said everyone will have to work collectively to take India to the top of the world and make it a 'vishwa guru'.</p><p>Addressing a programme at Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya to mark the golden jubilee of Shantikunj, Bhagwat said both RSS and Gayatri Pariwar, which runs the university, are preparing individuals capable of contributing to nation building.</p><p>""We all need to work collectively to make India a Vishwa Guru,"" he said.</p><p>He called upon everyone to do things in the spirit of ""Sarve Bhawantu Sukhinah"" (may all be happy) as that leads to contentment of the soul.</p><p>Bhagwat was welcomed at the dais by DSVV pro-vice chancellor Chinmay Pandya.</p><p>Earlier during the day, the RSS chief worshipped the Ganga at Har ki Pairi and took a dip in the river praying for peace and prosperity in the world, end to coronavirus and successful conduct of the ongoing Kumbh Mela. </p><p>Praising Ganga Sabha for the arrangements at Har ki Pauri, Bhagwat said the spirit of service alone leads to the development of a nation. </p>","<p>Maharashtra on Monday recorded 47,288 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, according to state department's health bulletin, marking a decrease from the 57,074 cases the state had recorded a day earlier.

All three are believed to be the ground zero for variants that make the coronavirus spread more readily or cheat immunity from a previous infection (or both).</p><p><strong>Parallel 1: London and SE England, the UK</strong></p><p>All things being equal (in terms of restrictions), Maharashtra’s case trajectory against the backdrop of the rest of the country has a particularly similarity with what happened in the UK at the outset of last winter.</p><p>Within a fortnight, beginning November 29, London and parts of UK’s south-east turned into new hotbeds of coronavirus infections. This was particularly stark since the country was in the middle of a lockdown (UK’s lockdowns have typically been less stringent than what Indians are used to) to avoid an expected surge during the Christmas holiday season.</p><p>This surge would eventually be attributed to the variant known as B.1.1.7, or VOC 202012/01 – the first coronavirus variant under investigation. The variant has since been correlated with the virus becoming more infective and slightly more lethal.</p><p><strong>Parallel 2: California, US</strong></p><p>A little over halfway into January, the state of California overtook the New York state to become the hardest hit region in terms of fatalities in the US. What would be its fourth wave, infections in California began surging in the run-up to Christmas for a peak that would last roughly three weeks beginning late December.</p><p>To be sure, California is US’s most populous state, but the December-January wave is unique for its magnitude — at one point it was detecting over four times as many cases in a day in December as its second wave in July.</p><p>The holiday season has been seen as a clear link. But increasingly, scientists are also suspected a new variant to be causing it. Over five months beginning September, this variant rose to account for more than 50% of all samples subjected to genetic analysis, the <a href=""https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-02-23/california-homegrown-coronavirus-strain-looks-increasingly-transmissible-and-dangerous"" target=""_blank"">LA Times reported</a>.</p><p>This variant is known as B.1.427 and B.1.429 and scientists believe that it may be drawing its more worrying nature from the particular mutation that has also been detected in Maharashtra: L452R.</p><p>At least two studies, <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/22/2/1239/5917277"" target=""_blank"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437925v1.full.pdf"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, find that the L452R mutation in particular was more resistant to antibodies drawn from people who had a previous infection with the globally predominant variant or from those that had taken vaccine doses. Both the studies were lab tests, and how this increased resistance translates needs to be verified.</p><p><strong>Parallel 3: Manaus, Brazil</strong></p><p>The region of Manaus in Brazil has been mysterious for scientists since the end of last year. For roughly seven months from May to November, the city with one of the highest population densities in Brazil reported very few Covid-19 cases, despite considerable relaxation of restrictions.</p><p>Researchers <a href=""https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6526/288"" target=""_blank"">estimated</a> that roughly three quarters of the population may have been infected, surpassing the theoretical herd immunity threshold. This partly supported the May-November lull in cases — until the outbreak exploded again.</p><p>Researchers now <a href=""https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext"" target=""_blank"">believe</a> there are four possible explanations for the lull and the resurgence — one, that the initial three-fourths attack rate was exaggerated and the population was never this protected; two, the seven-month period is when immunity from the first infection waned to cause re-infections; three, the new outbreak is triggered by a variant that is resistant to antibodies from previous immunity; and lastly, that a new variant that is more transmissible has taken hold.</p><p>The strongest suspicion now falls on the variant known as P.1, which has a constellation of mutations including the N501Y from UK’s B.1.1.7 variant and a mutation at the location 484 (known as E484K). N501Y has been linked to the UK variant becoming more infective while E484K has shown to be more resistant to antibodies generated in response to the older virus.</p><p><strong>The link with Maharashtra </strong></p><p>Similar trends have also been seen in South Africa, where the variant B.1.351 too has E484K mutation. But the examples of UK, US and Brazil have significant overlaps with what has been observed in Maharashtra and what little is known about the virus there.</p><p>The London-South-East England and California examples shows a sudden, relentless outbreak can be due to a fitter mutation – the latter case shares a particular mutation that has been found in Maharashtra.</p><p>The Manaus example too reinforces the risk from mutations, but it also points to the fact that herd immunity may not translate to any sort of protection in a region such as Maharashtra, which has consistently had high levels of outbreak since the pandemic began in India.</p><p>In all three cases, the outbreaks have spread out – driving new surges as the variants travel beyond states and borders.</p><p>The lack of data from genomic surveillance means India is unlikely to determine whether Maharashtra’s worsening situation is due to something similar, and the longer that question remains unanswered, the more difficult it becomes to take proactive decisions on measures to tackle it — for Maharashtra itself as well as the rest of the country.</p><p>India set up a consortium of labs called INSACOG and targeted genome sequencing of at least 5% of all positive. But since January, a little under 11,000 had been done — this number is short of the at least 48,000 it should have been, based on the 966,376 cases recorded in the country between January 1 and March 23.</p><p>Experts have called on the government to increase the whole genome sequencing volumes. What could also help is if the government releases the timeline of the genomes sequenced till now, which determine how proportion of mutation samples change in a region — helping establish at least one proxy for epidemiological estimation.</p><p>Determining the threat from variants is key not only to head off the current outbreak, but also to tweak India’s vaccination strategy — including the question whether the government now needs to look at approaching other developers with more immunogenic products.</p>","<p>Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ignoring Indira Gandhi’s role in the creation of Bangladesh, saying he failed to mention her during his visit there to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence.</p><p>Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had made a similar charge but apologised later, conceding on Twitter that Modi did refer to the former prime minister when he participated in the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh’s independence.</p><p>Indian forces defeated the Pakistan Army in 1971, taking thousands of its soldiers prisoners.</p><p>Addressing railway workers, Gehlot claimed Modi skipped any reference to Indira Gandhi during the recent Bangladesh visit.</p><p>“Indira Gandhi did not bow to threats from the US.

The revelation comes at a time when five assembly elections are underway in the country. </p><p>A spokesperson for Dassault Aviation was yet to respond to an HT query on the Mediapart report. </p><p>India ordered the jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-french-report-on-rafale-payment-congress-demands-independent-inquiry-101617612494051.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">After French report on Rafale payment, Congress demands independent inquiry</a></b></p><p>The Mediapart report said AFA inspectors were surprised when they came across a “suspect payment” of 508,925 euros listed against the head “gifts to clients.” It said the revelation was the first instalment of a three-part investigation dubbed “Rafale Papers.” </p><p>“Mediapart understands that during a scheduled audit of the group, the agency’s inspectors found that Dassault had agreed to pay one million euros to a middleman just after the 2016 signing of the Rafale fighter jet deal. That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal,” the report said. </p><p>According to Mediapart, the AFA decided not to refer the matter to French prosecutors even though a subsequent confidential report of the agency found that the amount of 508,925 euros “seemed disproportionate in relation to all the other entries” under the same heading. </p><p>“The sum is indeed huge for a gift. Though French law does not set out precise limits, legal precedents suggest that giving a watch or an expensive meal costing several hundred euros can be enough to constitute corruption,” the Mediapart report said. </p><p>It said to justify the “gift”, Dassault supplied the AFA with a “proforma invoice” of March 30, 2017, which was given by an Indian company called Defsys Solutions. “This invoice, which related to 50% of the total order (€1,017,850), was for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of €20,357,” Mediapart said, quoting the AFA report. </p><p>The Mediapart report claimed that Defsys belongs to the Gupta family whose members have acted as middlemen in the aeronautical and defence industries for three generations. It said two Indian media reports from January 2019 revealed that one family member, Sushen Gupta, who operated as an agent for Dassault, had worked on the Rafale contract and allegedly obtained confidential documents from India’s Ministry of Defence. Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam. </p><p>HT is reaching out to Gupta and will update the copy once he responds.</p><p>In October 2018, Mediapart raised questions about the offset contract that was part of the Rafale deal. It said a senior official in Dassault Aviation saw the partnership with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as “imperative and mandatory” to getting the “export contract” with India for the Rafale aircraft. </p><p>The National Democratic Alliance’s decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).</p><p>The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.</p><p>The NDA has not disclosed details of the price, but the UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar has previously said, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. Indeed, the UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to pricing of items not included in the initial bid.</p><p>The NDA government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies; however, it said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.</p>","<p>A Sikh security personnel took off his turban to tie it around the wounds of a fellow jawan, as both were caught in one of the deadliest attacks by Maoists on security forces in recent months in Chhattisgarh, a senior police officer said on Monday.</p><p>RK Vij, a 1988 batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer in Chhattisgarh, spoke about Balraj Singh, the Sikh jawan who removed his turban, an article of his faith and something not to be removed, to help his colleague Abhishek Pandey, who also sustained injuries in the firing.

The first death was reported on March 21, according to officials, after which veterinary officers were sent to the district to ascertain the cause. The confirmatory test for ASF is yet to be done at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Madhya Pradesh, but the deaths have triggered fears in the state government which has already sounded alert for the disease.</p><p><strong>What is the African Swine Fever?</strong></p><p>African Swine Fever is a deathly and contagious viral disease which affects both domestic as well as wild pigs of all ages. The disease is not a threat to human health as it cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of the disease is almost 100 per cent and the disease can be transmitted through direct contact with the infected pig (alive or dead) or the wild pig (alive or dead), indirect contact through consumption of contaminated food waste, garbage by the swine.</p><p><strong>What are the symptoms of the disease?</strong></p><p>The symptoms of the disease include high fever, loss of appetite, weakness, red skin, skin lesions, diarrhoea, vomiting and difficulty in breathing, among others. The disease can cause sudden death in pigs. The disease has no approved vaccine and therefore culling of animals is required to prevent the spread of the infection.</p><p><strong>When was the last outbreak of the disease in the world?</strong></p><p>The disease was reported in China in August 2018 and by September 2018, the country had culled more than 38,000 hogs. By December, the disease spread in at least 23 provinces and municipalities across China. In 2019, the disease was reported in almost all regions of China as well as in southeast Asia which included Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Due to the disease, the pig population in China declined by almost 100 million in 2019 as compared to the previous year. The disease later spread to the Philippines, South Korea, East Timor and Taiwan within the year 2019.</p><p><strong>Has the disease ever affected India?</strong></p><p>The disease was first reported in India in April 2020 in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. According to the official data available with the veterinary department, over 15,000 pigs died because of the disease in 9 affected districts which were Golaghat, Majuli, Dibrugarh, Kamrup, Dhemaji, Biswanath, North Lakhimpur, Sibsagar and Jorhat.</p>","<p>India reported 103,558 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 478 related fatalities in the last 24 hours, which have pushed the country's infection tally to 12,589,067 and the death toll to 165,101, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Monday morning. On Sunday, there were 93,249 new coronavirus disease cases and 513 fatalities. The active cases of Covid-19 crossed the 700,000 and surged to 741,830, registering a steady increase for the 26th day in a row, the health ministry's dashboard showed at 8am. The active caseload was at its lowest at 135,926 on February 12. With 52,847 patients cured of Covid-19, recoveries have risen to 11,682,136 and the recovery rate stands at 92.79 per cent, the data showed.</p><p>Official data shows that Maharashtra, which has clamped new restrictions to arrest the rising infections, and Punjab are the two worst-hit states in terms of their share in the total number of new Covid-19 cases and deaths across the country in the last fortnight.

The growth rate of the last seven days for daily new cases till March 23 in Maharashtra was 3.6 per cent and in Punjab, it was 3.2 per cent. Maharashtra has added 4,26,108 cases in the last two weeks as of March 31, while Punjab has added 35,754 cases in the same period. Maharashtra and Punjab together reported around 60 per cent of India's fatalities of all deaths reported during these two weeks.</p><p>The health ministry has said 11 states - Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana - have been categorised as ""states of grave concern"" on account of their high and rising daily Covid-19 cases and higher daily deaths.</p><p>(With agency inputs)</p>","<p>Odisha has been faulted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for failing to achieve targeted employment of youth and for inflated expenditure under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDUGKY), run by the ministry of rural development. CAG also underlined massive irregularities in implementation of the scheme, for which the state was earlier adjudged top achiever for two consecutive years.</p><p>The DDUGKY was started by the Centre in September 2014 for imparting skills to rural youth between the ages of 15 and 35 years and giving them regular jobs and was tied into the National Rural Livelihoods Mission programme. Of the 6.28 lakh rural youths who were employed till December last year, Odisha claimed to have placed the highest number of youth--1,33,853, followed by Andhra Pradesh (67,128) and Jammu and Kashmir (60,433), according to data available on the DDUGKY website.</p><p>The CAG audited the scheme for the period between 2014 and 2019 and found that 14% training and 77% placements claimed by Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS), the implementing agency of the scheme, were false and fabricated. ORMAS engaged 95 Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs), mostly private, to provide training in placement-linked skill development courses, but the CAG audit found that many of these agencies were unfit while several of them exaggerated the employment figures.</p><p>ORMAS received <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>657.90 crore during 2014-19 under DDUGKY and spent <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>568.43 crore as of March 2019 for its target of training 2.02 lakh rural youth. It claimed to have trained 1.31 lakh youth by March 2019 and placed 97,198 of these in jobs.</p><p>But the CAG audit team found that ORMAS provided undue favour to project implementing agencies by skipping the laid-down appraisal process, a crucial internal control mechanism. The PIAs were selected again and again despite a poor record of placing youth.</p><p>The audit also found that many of the PIAs, though financially ineligible, were awarded projects in violation of the laid-down procedures due to the intervention of executive director of ORMAS and secretary of panchayati raj department. Four PIAs were sanctioned five projects worth <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>102.13 crore during September 2016 to September 2018 while they were only eligible for projects worth <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>25.20 crore.</p><p>“The PIAs were selected arbitrarily without conducting mandatory qualitative assessment in terms of their financial strength, commitment to captive placement, parent company structure and core sector presence, etc., which amounted to extension of undue pecuniary benefits to certain PIAs. The PIAs misused the provisions in the DDUGKY reporting system that allowed them to revise MIS figures at their level,” the CAG audit found.</p><p>One PIA was supposed to provide overseas placements and set up a centre of excellence in Odisha. It continued to get the projects despite failing in both stated objectives. Two PIAs who claimed to have earlier provided placement to 916 and 257 candidates, respectively later revised the figures to 619 and 234 candidates respectively.</p><p>Claims by PIAs of having provided jobs to the youths also turned out to be exaggerated. CAG audit found that bank statements of several youths did not show any entry, forget salary credit. At least six bank accounts were found to be non-existent and no transactions were seen in 33 accounts. Some of the PIAs even faked ESIC numbers and salary slips of 19 candidates, who they claimed to have provided jobs.</p><p>The CAG recommended a thorough investigation of all the placement claims. “Ensure that after the verification is conducted, placement percentage is recalculated and any excess money released is recovered with penal interest,” the CAG advised.</p><p>The CAG report on DDUGKY has come at a time when the state government is under fire from opposition over lack of employment for youths. Recently, leader of opposition Pradipta Naik alleged Odisha has more than 9 lakh registered unemployed youths while thousands of people migrate to other states in search of jobs.</p>","<p>Rains have been lashing Kashmir Valley since midnight in line with the meteorological department’s forecast for rainfall and snowfall in the Union Territory for the next three days.

The report said that the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries. </p><p>The Congress demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland. </p><p>The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe. “Any evidence of middleman or commission or bribery has serious penal consequences of banning of the supplier defence company, cancellation of contract, registration of FIR and imposition of heavy financial penalties on the defence supplier company,” said Surjewala. </p><p>After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless.

Mahato was given the responsibility of at least 10 constituencies in three districts by TMC ahead of the first phase of polls. </p><p>Other than that, several top officials in Bengal have been summoned by ED and CBI—including state security advisor Surajit Kar Purakayastha, principal secretary in the CM’s office, Gautam Sanyal, state additional chief secretary B P Gopalika, and Kolkata additional police commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena in separate cases. </p><p>Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly said in the last few weeks, during her public appearances, that BJP’s only allies are now CBI and ED. She wrote to 15 Opposition leaders on March 31 urging them to unite against BJP to defend democracy and claimed that the BJP government at the Centre has been brazenly and vindictively using CBI and ED in the functioning of non-BJP states. </p><p>In Assam, the NIA arrested peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in December 2019 for anti-national activities. While jailed, he is contesting elections from Sibsagar constituency after launching a party—Raijor Dal—about five months back. </p><p>The spike in action against Opposition leaders was also visible during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as assembly elections in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir.

And even the shreds of moral or constitutional behaviour lie shattered and ripped by these people.” </p><p>The Central agencies did not officially comment on the raids and summons to Opposition leaders before elections but several officers HT spoke to deny allegations of “political misuse”. A CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The raids and summons are crucial part of process in CBI, and the time is decided only after certain allegations are verified or Investigation Officer feels he/she need clarification.” </p><p>But others were more candid. A former head of one of the top agencies, requesting anonymity, agreed they face some pressure from dispensation to act against Opposition leaders. “It is true action intensifies around elections, particularly in those cases which were lying unattended for years. But, this happens in all governments.” </p><p>Political analysts believe the issue reflects a systemic crisis in the political structure and spans across governments, though there have been questions raised about the degree to which such raids and investigations have increased under the current government. Sandeep Shastri, author and political scientist said, “I think this is not a challenge just with the current government. If you look at the last two-three decades, irrespective of which party has been at the Centre, they have tried to use the public institutions to their benefit. There needs to be stronger and vigilant public campaign to ensure autonomy of these agencies”. </p>","<p>The Supreme Court on Monday stayed trial proceedings against Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa in an alleged corruption case relating to de-notifying 26 acres of land acquired for a government housing project in Bengaluru during his previous term as chief minister in 2011. </p><p>A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde stayed the January 5,2021 order passed by Karnataka high court restoring the criminal case against Yediyurappa and two others. Earlier, the SC had stayed their arrest while taking up Yediyurappa’s appeal against the high court order. </p><p>On Monday, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, appearing for the Karnataka CM, said that despite stay of arrest, the trial was proceeding against him and that needs to be stayed. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-espionage-case-sc-appointed-probe-panel-submits-report-101617444756911.html"">ISRO espionage case: SC-appointed probe panel submits report</a></b></p><p>The bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramsubramanian, agreed to grant stay as it is examining the legal questions raised in Yediyurappa’s appeal. </p><p>The allegation was made against Yeddyurappa by public spirited persons led by A Alam Pasha, alleging that during his tenure as CM between 2008-11, he denotified 26 acres land acquired by the government for construction of houses for low income and middle income families. This project was part of an upcoming IT park project at Devanahalli Industrial Park in Bengaluru Rural district. </p><p>A Bengaluru court had ordered investigation by State Lokayukta in May 2012 on Pasha’s complaint. In June 2013, Yediyurappa, along with former industries minister Murugesh Nirani and two others, was framed for alleged forgery and provisions under Prevention of Corruption Act. </p><p>He took the matter to Karnataka high court which set aside the criminal case against the accused in October 2013 citing lack of sanction to prosecute Yediyurappa. This led to dismissal of case by the trial judge on August 26, 2016.</p><p>Pasha later challenged this order, resulting in the order of January 5 this year. The high court held in its order that since Yediyurappa had demitted office in 2011, taking sanction was not necessary. Yediyurappa had challenged this finding of the high court, claiming fresh sanction will be necessary to proceed further. </p>","<p>India's home minister Amit Shah cut short an election rally in the east on Monday to head to the mineral-rich central state of Chhattisgarh, where Maoist gureillas at the weekend killed 22 security force members, officials said.</p><p>In addition to the fatalities, 30 other members of the Indian police and paramilitary forces were wounded in a four-hour gun battle with Maoist rebels on Saturday, the deadliest ambush of its kind in four years.</p><p>On Monday, Shah travelled to Chhattisgarh to meet the injured pay tribute to those killed.</p><p>Also known as Naxals, the Maoists have waged an armed insurgency against the government for decades.

We do not take pride that our party won; we take pride that the people of this country made us win,” he said. </p><p>Taking another dig at regional satraps that have become “dynastic parties”, he said the parties that emerged as representatives of regional aspirations have now become “family-controlled” parties. </p><p>“In this (BJP) party, workers toil hard and thousands of workers have made sacrifices...In Kerala and in West Bengal our workers are threatened, attacked and their families are also not spared… but they are steadfast in their resolve to live and die for the country, this is the uniqueness of the BJP workers.

On March 25, COVAX announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.</p><p>Since then, daily new infections in India have almost doubled, with the biggest single-day spike of over 100,000 new cases on Monday. Infections are being reported faster in India than anywhere else in the world, prompting tougher virus restrictions in New Delhi and its financial capital, Mumbai.</p><p>India initially immunized the most vulnerable, but broadened that to anyone over 45 on April 1 because of the surge in cases. The resulting increased demand forced the halt in exports. Since then, several top state officials have urged the federal government to further expand vaccinations.</p><p>Poonawalla said the company has “chosen to prioritize India temporarily for two months” and hopes to then restart exports.</p><p>If India's surge in infections doesn't subside, ""I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said. “We are going to have to keep supplying to India, and not anywhere else. Because we have to protect our nation.”</p><p>He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries, and that he has been fielding phone calls from various heads of state.</p><p>“I've had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most world leaders understood because they were facing the same issues — the needs of domestic politics and questions raised by opposition parties and the public.</p><p>“Nationalism is happening ... to a certain extent, everywhere,” Poonawalla said, pointing to vaccine export controls imposed by Europe, and the use in the United States of the Defense Production Act to prevent exports of critical raw materials needed to scale up vaccine manufacturing.</p><p>He said the unavailability of these raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, could affect the Serum Institute's production of another vaccine, Novavax, which is still being tested in India. It has signed a deal to supply Novavax to COVAX, but pivoting to different suppliers of the raw materials would result in a delay of five to six months, he said.</p><p>“The crunch ... for supplies is today,"" he said.</p>","<p>An ordinance to end part of India’s appellate structure has irked Congress with party leaders dashing out letters to protest “a terrible breach of trust”. They also wondered if “anything better” be expected from the NDA government. </p><p>At the heart of the conflict is The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance that was promulgated on Sunday. Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh claimed that NDA’s parliament managers had assured the Opposition during the budget session that the bill would be sent to a standing committee for review. </p><p>In a letter to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Ramesh said, “I am not writing to you on the merits of the ordinance. All I wish to do is express my disgust at the terrible breach of faith as far as not referring the bill to the standing committee concerned.”</p><p>The legislation, piloted by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, aims to dissolve at least eight existing appellate tribunals and transfer their responsibilities to other bodies including high courts. </p><p>Jairam claimed that when the budget session was drawing to a close, government managers informed him that the bill would not be taken up for passage and would be sent to a House panel. </p><p>Congress leader Manish Tewari shot a similar letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and argued that chapter 12 of the bill introduces major amendments to section 184 of the finance bill and directly impacts the functioning and composition of 19 key tribunals. </p><p>He added that the proposed law envisages a “complete control” over the mechanisms of 19 tribunals and said, “the bill must be referred to the standing committee for a thorough review of any inherent vulnerabilities in the proposed amendments. Given the sheer degree of dilution or modification that can be done through the misuse of this power, you will surely agree that the amendments should not be hurried and must be examined.”</p><p>The NDA’s ordinance route and passing bills without review of parliamentary panels have been a matter of concern for the Opposition. PRS Legislative Research said in its report, “In the 17th Lok Sabha, so far, 11% of the introduced Bills have been referred to a committee; much lower than the 14th (60%), 15th (71%), and 16th (27%) Lok Sabhas.”</p>","<p>The Centre said on Tuesday that Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh are still the cause of maximum concern because of the high number of COVID-19 cases being reported there daily.</p><p>At a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra is concerning because of its share in the total number of cases as well as in total deaths.</p><p>The situation in Punjab and Chhattisgarh is worrying because of their share in the number of deaths, he said.</p><p>Chhattisgarh's Durg is among the top 10 districts with high active COVID cases.

When the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what are known as bilateral crackles, sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. Sure enough, in both their cases, a Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, a consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia set in on the third day. </p><p>And that, experts say, may well be the story of Mumbai’s second wave. </p><p>“Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage of the infection. </p><p>CT scans of many positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly rising, doctors said. The result: more patients require intensive treatment and hospitalisation, although, on the positive side, most recover. </p><p>Given their age, the couple were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are showing signs of early lung infections. During the last wave, only very few patients would show up with such early infections, he said. </p><p>Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” he added. </p><p>A CT-scan severity score ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection. </p><p>“I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that young people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Dr Bajan. </p><p>From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped sharply to 2866 cases per day in March. The city reported an average of 9500 per day in the first five days of April. The number of active cases in the city has jumped by at least 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5. </p><p>According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical. </p><p>“Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said. </p><p>Some experts say it is possible that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster. We are also seeing significantly affected lungs in patients but we did see a similar trend last year too,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “I think what is concerning right now is the overwhelming number of cases.” </p>","<p>At a time when the demand for the Covid-19 vaccine is rising in the country amid a surge in new cases, the chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India (SII), Adar Poonawalla, on Tuesday said that the company was “very outstretched” for capacity at the moment.</p><p>He added that SII needed around <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>3,000 crore to scale up production from the current capacity of 60 to 65 million per month, and that the process would take roughly three months.</p><p>“We are supplying the vaccine in the Indian market at approximately <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span> 150-160. The average price of the vaccine is approximately $20 ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,500)... because of the Modi government’s request, we are providing vaccines at subsidised rates... It is not that we are not making profits... but we are not making a super profit, which is key to re-investing,” Poonawalla told NDTV.</p><p>“This (the amount needed) would be roughly <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>3,000 crores. The process takes 85 days, so it would be just under three months before we scale up operations,” he added.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is manufactured by SII and sold in India under the brand name Covishield.</p><p>“We are supplying two million doses per day. It varies... but we are making between 60 and 65 million per month. We have given, so far, over 100 million doses to India, and exported over 60 million,” Poonawalla said in the interview, adding that supply constraints will only ease once other manufacturers also scale up capacity.</p><p>“We hope that, with them, even Covishield will increase capacity to 100 to 110 million doses a month (but) that’s only going to happen from June. That’s where we are at the moment,” he said.</p><p>Covishield is one of the two Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in India. The other Covid-19 vaccine is Covaxin that is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and India Council of Medical Research.</p><p>“Very stressed to put it quite frankly. The globe needs this vaccine... we are prioritising the needs of India (but) we are still short of being able to supply to every Indian,” Poonawalla told NDTV.</p><p>Last month, COVAX facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, said that it was looking at supply delays to the tune of at least 60-70 million doses produced by SII to lower-income countries because India was slowing down its Covid-19 vaccine exports.</p><p>“We provided Serum Institute of India 150 million in pre finance to ramp up production. Our agreement stipulates 50% of production to be given to COVAX. Through Serum Institute of India, COVAX provides Covid-19 vaccines to more than 60 low income countries, primarily in Asia and Africa. If Government of India bans export of doses, all those countries would suffer,” Anuradha Gupta, deputy, chief executive officer, Gavi- the vaccine alliance that is co-leading COVAX facility, told HT on March 26.</p><p>.</p>","<p>India set yet another record for daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with 115,320 new infections reported across the country on Tuesday – the second time in three days that the country has broken previous single-day case records, highlighting the dangerous rate at which the second wave is growing.</p><p>The previous record for daily cases (103,796) was set on Saturday when new infections in the country had crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time since the start of the outbreak.</p><p>A total of 630 new deaths were reported across India on Tuesday, taking the total number of fatalities due to the viral outbreak in the country to 166,229, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.</p><p>The number of active cases in the country, meanwhile, also continued to surge as the recoveries failed to keep up with the huge surge in cases.

The strike is likely to affect public transport in the state.</p><p><strong>Here’s everything you need to know about the Karnataka transport strike from Wednesday:</strong></p><p>1. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa appealed to road transportation corporation workers not to hold the strike. “We have fulfilled eight out of your (workers) nine demands. We have to work together for the welfare of the people. Without giving room for the government to take strict measures, drop the strike and cooperate with the administration,” CM Yediyurappa said on Tuesd.</p><p>2. The Karnataka government has warned of strict action against the workers if the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions are not followed. ""There are Covid-19 restrictions in place and a notification has already been issued under the Disaster Management Act stating that people cannot gather in groups. If it is violated, action will be taken under the act, also IPC, police act among others,"" state chief secretary Kumar said. ""Their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report, and thereby give them the salary on par with the government employees, cannot be accepted,"" Kumar added.</p><p>3. With the aim to reduce inconvenience of the general public, the state government has made alternative arrangements for transport by roping in private operators. The government has also deployed more trains to places like Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru among others.</p><p>4. The state government has also allowed the state road transport corporation to hire private buses and school buses for transportation, according to news agency ANI.</p><p>5. The government has also said that strict action will be taken against autos and cabs if they charge higher fares taking advantage of the transport strike. Keeping in account the same, the government has issued a notification fixing cab and bus fares.</p>","<p>Last year, Shiva Prasad Rath lost three relatives — a sister and two brothers-in-law — to the coronavirus disease. “All in a period of eight months,” said Rath, a 73-year-old former government employee from Odisha. “It was just horrific.”</p><p>Rath lives with his wife, Swapna (64), in Bhubaneswar. The Raths could not attend the last rites of their relatives, two of which took place in September. In November, another sister and brother-in-law were hospitalised; this time, his sister survived, but her husband died.</p><p>At the time, the caseload in Odisha was 294,457; as of April 6, 2021, the number of cases in the state is 343,856 and 1,975 people have died till date.</p><p>“It was so scary,” said Swapna, a teacher, who stopped giving tuition classes when the lockdown began on March 25, 2020. “I didn’t even see the front gate of my house [for several months],” Rath said, alluding to how they stayed indoors through the lockdown and even after it was lifted. They got their vegetables delivered, they put off a visit to the cardiologist — necessary for Rath who had a stent inserted a decade ago — and they avoided all public places, including temples.</p><p>The fear, said the Raths, was also driven by the number of messages over social media messaging platforms that began to circulate shortly after the vaccination drive started in the country. “There were so many videos and messages. One said that people with high blood pressure would fall down senseless after getting a shot; one said there were no guarantees of whether there would be any side-effects after vaccination,” Swapna said.</p><p><br></p><p>Rath had an additional worry. The Covaxin fact sheet states that people on blood thinners should inform their health care providers. Initially, this led to widespread confusion about whether there were certain drugs that had contraindications for vaccination. The ICMR subsequently issued a clarification towards the end of January that both Covid vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — approved for use in India were safe for people on such medication.</p><p>All the same, Rath went to a doctor just to be sure, and the doctor advised him to take the jab.</p><p>On March 25, the Raths visited a vaccination centre at the Hi-Tech Medical College &amp; Hospital, close to their home, and got their first dose of the vaccine. “The process was very easy,” Rath said.</p><p>Rath experienced some degree of tiredness after taking the shot. “I think it was psychological...,” Swapna said, adding that she only felt a little pain in the arm after the shot.</p><p>The companies manufacturing these vaccines — Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (Covishield) — have published a list of possible side effects the respective vaccines could lead to. These range from pain at the injection site to chills, body ache and nausea.</p><p>It was a very good thought, Swapna said, to think of senior citizens as the first group after health care workers, to get the shot. The main lesson from the pandemic, Swapna said, was that it is possible to take care of oneself — healthy diet, regular exercise, and “wearing masks at all times” but that “a little bit of fear [of the pandemic] is also a good thing, because it ensures that we follow rules”.</p><p>The Raths rue the fact that the “younger generation” doesn’t wear masks or maintains social distancing anymore.</p><p>“But there is nothing scary about taking the vaccine.

In September 2020, India came close to 100,000 Covid-19 cases a day, and it seemed an inexorable rise. And then magically, the cases started to dip, and with a few blips here and there in specific cities, by January, we were seeing fewer than 10,000 new cases a day. In February, the numbers starting heading up again, and we have now breached 100,000 new cases per day, the second country in the world to do so.</p><p>Why did this happen now? Why did the numbers escalate beyond what India had at its peak the first time? For the Sars-CoV-2, it does not take a lot of virus to infect another person. When people mingle, speak, shout and sing, they unknowingly spew out infectious virus. This clear mode of transmission is what makes masks, distancing and ventilation so effective. In September, we cared about prevention, and emerging from severe restrictions, were willing to do what it took to keep spread down. From then on, week by week, we have been slipping, first in some regions, then others, with some activities and then others. Crowding on public transport, in markets, at festivals, at family celebrations and during elections are back to being acceptable. The communication from the government and of experts seem to go unheard.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-surpasses-us-to-become-fastest-covid-19-vaccinating-country-says-centre-101617782031490.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>India surpasses US to become fastest Covid-19 vaccinating country, says Centre</strong></a></p><p><strong>Also Watch | How India could have avoided second Covid wave &amp; why next 45 days is crucial</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This lack of appropriate behaviour that could prevent the virus’ spread has increased, and potentially been amplified, because of viruses that are more transmissible than the ancestral version of the virus that we had last year. We are still not clear about the proportion of B.1.1.7 or the United Kingdom variant, which spreads more easily and may cause more severe disease, and which has badly affected Punjab, and possibly other states.</p><p>The new Indian so-called “double mutant” variant is now the global lineage B1.617. But is this virus more transmissible? Does it cause more severe disease? Will vaccines work? These are questions that we will be able to answer if we can interrogate our health data and back it up with standardised laboratory investigations as in other parts of the world.</p><p>We have two vaccines that work well against Sars-CoV-2. Covishield had the advantage of large-scale clinical trials being conducted elsewhere that generated efficacy data quickly, requiring small scale studies in India. But it also has a disadvantage — the initial messy data about doses, intervals and age groups and miscommunication by AstraZeneca have led to confused messaging about how to use the vaccine. Covaxin has the advantage of tremendous support from the government of India but the disadvantage of needing to do large-scale clinical trials in India, never an easy task, given the lack of clinical research experience at many sites.</p><p>But the roll-out of vaccines, despite the fast-tracking of approvals, prioritisation frameworks, central procurement, efforts at preparedness for vaccination sites and sessions, establishment of process and development of the CoWin app, has been slow. The government originally planned to immunise 300 million people by June-July (later July-August), and this appears very unlikely if the pace of vaccination does not increase several-fold.</p><p>Are we in the same position that we were in during the rapid increase of the first peak in India? If not, what makes it different? From the serological surveys, between a quarter and one-third of the population has been infected but this is not evenly distributed by place and stratum of society; so those who had the ability to isolate last year and are not yet vaccinated, are more likely to get infected. But given that vaccines work much better than expected, it is not unreasonable to suppose that our immune systems are capable of handling this virus well. This means that previously infected people should expect some protection against severe disease for several months.</p><p>Additionally available vaccines provide some, not complete, measure of protection against most viral variants. If one-third of the population is already protected at least against severe disease, and we can ramp up vaccination quickly while continuing the measures that we know restrict the spread of the virus, then control is feasible, even with the new variants.</p><p>We know what works, but to use the tools we have most effectively, we need more detailed data. We are not in the same situation today that we were in last year, so control measures cannot be one-size-fits-all.</p><p>We need to know more about the people who are getting infected. Where are they from? Age? Gender? Vaccinated? Previously infected? Disease severity? If we have this information and can tie it together, we can achieve more tailored strategies for control instead of strategies that have an uncertain effect. What does a night curfew prevent and how effective is it? We don’t really have the data.</p><p>Yet, on the other hand, we are bombarded by news that affects vaccine uptake, for instance, “Doctors infected after vaccination”, “Healthcare worker in XX dies two days after vaccination”. Conveying both truth and uncertainty is important, as is explaining with facts that vaccines are not perfect, that care continues to be required when there are high numbers of cases in our communities, that we have a surveillance system for picking up vaccine side-effects, but it may not be always able to assess the relationship with the vaccines.</p><p>This is a challenging time, but we have the science to help us get through this pandemic and future ones. We need to use it, together.</p><p><em>Gagandeep Kang is professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore </em></p><p><em>The views expressed are personal</em></p>","<p>A high-level committee meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be held on Thursday to commemorate Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur’s birth anniversary . </p><p>The meeting will be attended by Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal, Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal, and cricketer Harbhajan Singh.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/board-exams/pariksha-pe-charcha-will-be-exciting-interaction-says-prime-minister-modi-101617783860878.html"">‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ will be exciting interaction, says Prime Minister Modi</a></b></p><p>Home minister Amit Shah is also expected to attend the meeting that will be held virtually to discuss the year-long calendar of events to celebrate this occasion.

Out of this, the PM has addressed 11 rallies in Bengal, seven in Assam; and three each in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and one in Puducherry. </p><p>But it was not just the number of rallies: in each speech, the PM made significant pointers which revealed both his political worldview, the party’s strategy, governance achievements, and an attack on political rivals. Here is the main thrust of his messages. </p><p><b>West Bengal - 11 rallies</b></p><p>The PM’s first official election rally in the state, where the BJP is locked in a tight contest with the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), was in Kolkata’s Brigade Ground on March 7. This was followed by public addresses on March 18 in Purulia; on March 20 in Kharagpur; and on March 2 in Bankura. On March 24, the PM’s schedule included a rally in Kanthi followed by two more addresses in Uluberia and Jayanagar; on April 3, the PM addressed two meetings in Tarkeshwar and Sonarpur. On April 6, he was back in Cooch Behar and Howrah. </p><p>His speeches have focused largely on the lack of development in the state, political violence and corruption. In sharp, calibrated attacks, the PM has kept the focus on corruption and the leakages in the public distribution system. “Where there is a scheme, there’s a scam,” — with statements such as these, the PM has not only lashed out at the TMC, but also posited the BJP as the alternative that has promised a sonar bangla or golden Bengal. </p><p>“Asol Parivartan” or the real change has also been the PM’s key promise to the people of Bengal. On Tuesday, for instance, while speaking at a rally in Cooch Behar, PM Modi who has been calling for a poriborton or change, coined another slogan Chalo Paltai (let us bring about the change) to target CM Mamata Banerjee.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/bjp-internal-assessment-nandigram-a-contest-101617758859753.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">BJP internal assessment: Nandigram a contest</a></b></p><p>With the Opposition accusing the BJP of stoking communal polarisation in the state and turning the Jai Shri Ram slogan into a war cry, the PM retorted that had the BJP, like Banerjee, appealed for votes on the basis of religion, then it would have to face the music from the election commission as well as the media. At the same time, his speeches have been laced with critical references to “appeasement”, which is code for what the BJP alleges to be the pro-Muslim tilt of Mamata Banerjee’s government. </p><p>In his speeches, the PM has also targeted the CM for not allowing the benefits of Central schemes such as the PM KIsan Nidhi from reaching beneficiaries. In multiple speeches, he has alleged that women, backward classes, farmers and tea garden workers have been deprived of social welfare schemes. </p><p>The Opposition has dismissed the PM’s campaign. </p><p>“I don’t think there will be much impact of his campaigning . People were curious about the PM and came to see him initially. But yesterday, he addressed a meeting in a rural area and it wasn’t packed. He is trying his best to polarise.

He also, repeatedly, invoked former chief ministers MG Ramachandran and J Jayalalitha, and accused the Congress of disrespecting democracy. The BJP in Tamil Nadu used the Vetrivel Yatra, designed to cover the six abodes of Lord Murugan in the state, as an attempt to cultivate its image as that of a party trying to revive Tamil pride, and the PM, while referring to the Central schemes and their benefits, said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is inspired by the great Andal and Avvaiyar. It was, once again, in line with the deference shown to local culture and tradition that the PM brought up the United Progressive Alliance government’s stance on banning Jallikattu and how it was the NDA that cleared the ordinance brought by AIADMK, allowing Jallikattu to take place again. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/tn-polls-clad-in-ppe-kit-covid-19-positive-kanimozhi-cast-vote-in-chennai-101617725250752.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">TN polls: Clad in PPE kit, Covid-19 positive Kanimozhi cast vote in Chennai</a></b></p><p>Attacks against dynastic politics, as represented by both the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress, were part of the PM’s speeches. “NDA agenda is development agenda while Congress and DMK have only dynasty agenda.

Bihpuria and Sipajhar were the next destinations for his rallies on March 23 and 24 and these were followed by a rally each in Kokjrajhar and Tamulpur on April 1 and 3. </p><p>The PM’s speeches targeted the Mahajot or the Opposition’s alliance and referred to it as “Mahajhoot” or grand lies.

It should be watched by more people who are rooted in areas where OTT isn’t watched,” she says.</p><p>In fact, it was raining release dates until now in Bollywood, which is why the actor is more than keen that her film also gets one soon. “We are very excited for Mimi to release. The times we are in, it’s important for a film like that to get a release. I am hoping things normalize soon. There are so many films pending to release in general. I am hoping Mimi does too, soon, sometime around mid 2021. I don’t know what the producers are deciding. They are also figuring out a good date.

Announcements for new films were being made one after the other, shoots were getting started and wrapped up as well. But the Covid pandemic refuses to slow down, and hence Maharashtra theatres have been shut till April 30. This in turn has led to filmmakers rethinking about their releases.</p><p>Rohit Shetty has postponed the already delayed Sooryavanshi, again. What happens to the rest of the biggies- Thalaivi in April, Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai and Satayameva Jayate 2 in May, and so on? Does the entire year seem set for a reshuffle?</p><p>Experts and makers believe so. Producer Anand Pandit, who has delayed the theatrical release of his Amitabh Bachchan starrer Chehre, says, “Unfortunately, we have only got 52 Fridays in a year, and there are usually 300-400 films. Entire months of April and May will go, I am sure films will start releasing only after June. It will disturb the whole calendar.”</p><p>Rajender Jyala, Chief Programming Officer, INOX Leisure, says while south releases are on track so far, Hindi films will change their dates. “Sooryavanshi will have to find a new release date now. We don’t know when the theatres will reopen. Once that clarity comes, then the re scheduling will happen in the whole lineup,” he says.</p><p><b>RELEASE SANS MAHARASHTRA?</b></p><p>Jyala adds that these are tough times indeed for theatres. “There is no income. We are hopeful that this time, we will open very soon. The government has expedited the vaccination drive. It’s highly unlikely that makers will choose to release big film in other states barring Maharashtra. Smaller films, yes, maybe. Maharashtra contributes 30-35 percent of all India box office. Even earlier when Maharashtra theatres reopened at 50 percent capacity, other cinemas in the country were open, and films were releasing. Films will release, but not those on a bigger scale. For that, Maharashtra theatres have to reopen,” he explains.</p><p>Exhibitors agree and say that no filmmaker would want to release their film without the Maharashtra revenue. Akshaye Rathi tells us, “Films releasing in April or early May will obviously reconsider their plans. Given the fact that Maharashtra is shutting down, it’s possibly the biggest market in terms of box office revenue for Hindi films. With that out of the equation, no producer would want to release in other belts. Most Hindi and Hollywood films this month are planning to change dates. The impact of Maharashtra is on the other parts of the country as well. It is extremely damaging, after close to a year of being shut.”</p><p><b>OTT ROUTE INSTEAD?</b></p><p>Will filmmakers who can’t wait anymore for theatres to reopen, opt for OTT releases instead? The mounting costs for delaying a release might compel some. But Pandit, whose film The Big Bull will premiere on a streaming platform, reasons, “There is no general thumb rule. Small films may go for it. I don’t think any OTT player will be able to match the numbers for big films like Sooryavanshi . It’s very unlikely they will go to OTTs. There was no economic reason behind me releasing TBT on OTT. We are a zero debt company, so we don’t have that pressure mounting on us. We thought it would be a good bet for OTT, as there was demand for good content there. Chehre would be a beautiful experience for cinema goers, that is why we are holding on to it for a theatrical.”</p><p>Trade expert Atul Mohan also says the situation is uncertain as to when will theatres in Maharashtra be functional again. “It’s not assured that cinemas will reopen on May 1. Whether it will get extended or not, there is no clarity. Hindi films won’t release elsewhere therefore, as they can’t afford to lose such a big market,” he says.</p><p><b>Interact with the author on Twitter/ <a href=""https://twitter.com/RishabhSuri02?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" target=""_blank"">@RishabhSuri02</a></b></p><p><b>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/htshowbiz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" target=""_blank"">@htshowbiz</a> on Twitter</b></p>","<p>Actor <a href=""http://Bhumi%20Pednekar"" target=""_blank"">Bhumi Pednekar</a> has shared a health update for her fans after she tested positive for coronavirus on Monday.

I do things for my own happiness... jaise apni beti ke saath shaam ko ghar ke pass ek shaant se beach pe sunset dekhne jana. Mein woh karta hun jo mujhe mere liye important lagta hai. Isiliye, mujhe success aur failure se bahut zyada asar nahi hota,” says Tripathi, who ensures that he spends such moments with his family, whenever he gets time.</p>","<p>She is on an enviable run. After Ludo opened to a good response in 2020 on an OTT platform, her latest web release, Pagglait, is winning praise from all quarters. Sanya Malhotra’s journey till this point too, has been filled with blockbusters such as Dangal (2016) and Badhaai Ho (2018).</p><p>Ask her if she feels like a celebrity at this point, and she laughs, “No! I never feel like a celebrity. Also because I hardly step out of my house. I do not interact with a lot of people. But yes, on social media, to see how much love I get from my audience, I feel happy and gratified that ‘baap re, they actually like my work!’ They send me messages and comments which are really nice, dekh ke achha lagta hai.”</p><p>But she does recognise the negative aspect of social media and agrees that when it comes to celebs, they are trolled both if they stay quiet or say anything on any issue.</p><p>“There is this cancel culture, where they cancel people on social media. You do whatever you want to do in life, and not just for actors, I say this for everyone,” she adds.</p><p>The 29-year-old, who will be seen next in the films Love Hostel and Meenakshi Sundareshwar, is happy with the way her career is shaping up. On the response she received for Ludo Malhotra reveals the best compliment she got for her performance was given by the director, Anurag Basu, himself.</p><p>“I can’t believe I worked with him. I did a commercial ad way back with him, before Dangal. He was the director, and I starred with Ranbir Kapoor. I always thought that I have performed so well, ek-do filmein toh milengi mujhe!

And on Sunday, Maharashtra government announced that it is shutting down theatres and multiplexes, yet again, to curb the spread of the virus.</p><p>Industry people certainly do feel history is repeating itself. Just when the momentum was beginning to build since January this year, with as many as 25 new films being announced, the latest spike in Covid cases including Akshay Kumar (who was shooting for Ram Sethu), R Madhavan, Kartik Aaryan (shooting for Bhool Bhulaiya 2) and Alia Bhatt put a sort of stop to it. </p><p>As trade analyst Taran Adarsh puts it, “Producers had started announcing their release dates, and now there’s this spike. In Mumbai specifically. It is a very depressing scenario. The first quarter has not been great for the Hindi film industry. There are financial implications as well. Shoots come to a halt, Akshay had so many projects, and now Ram Sethu has stopped. For that matter, any actor coming down with it, has it’s repercussions.”</p><p>Numbers too have been dismal, naturally because there was no data generated. The box office figures were increasing every year for the past three years. In 2020, Bollywood did a business of almost 600 crores in the first three months alone, until Corona struck. Hollywood films too were doing exceedingly well, with an estimated 750 crores of business in 2017, 950 in 2018, and 1240 in 2019. However, in 2021, all Bollywood could manage with limited releases in the first quarter was 50 crores, as trade expert Atul Mohan tells us.</p><p><b>FATE OF RELEASES</b></p><p>April itself had two big releases set for a release- Akshay’s Sooryavanshi and Kangana Ranaut’s Thalaivi. Mohan says they will get postponed again because Maharashtra is a big circuit, and the makers won’t be okay with films not playing here. “You can’t ignore Maharashtra is the biggest contributor to collections for any films. It contributes around 40 percent of net collection which is huge. The closure of cinema halls has come again, who knows when the reopening order may come? OTT releases are always on the cards, but every maker wants the big screen,” he says. May also has Salman Khan’s Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai and Satyameva Jayate 2. We reached out to Milap Zaveri, director of SJ2, but our efforts weren’t met with a response till the time of going to press.</p><p><b>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A SHOOT STOPS?</b></p><p>Makers who have to bear the brunt of their actors falling prey to the virus say technicians get affected too. Anees Bazmee had begun shooting after a year for Bhool Bhulaiya 2, only for it’s lead actor Kartik to catch the virus. “We were shooting with a lot of precautions, and got a lot of people vaccinated as well. But apart from actors, even directors have got Covid. The work stops when that happens, this is leading to a lot of loss in every kind of business, globally. There was a point when we felt things are coming back to normal. But the way cases are increasing now we need to take more precautions. It’s a dark hour for our industry. If things move like this, there will be a bad time when shoots might stop altogether,” he rues, adding that due to restrictions, the film’s budget increases as well. In a scenario where a shoot stops for some time, this piles on more burden on the producers.</p><p><b>WORKAROUND TO KEEP WORK GOING</b></p><p>What about the daily wage workers who work on a film project? What happens to them when the shoot stops? Ashoke Pandit, chief advisor, Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), says makers have their workarounds for such scenarios. “We have to fight this menace, and it cannot happen sitting at home, a lockdown is no solution. One has to earn their bread and butter. Initially, everyone had their sanitisation measures in place, but as time passed, we became very relaxed about rules. On the roads also you can see people not wearing masks. This is not just related to the industry. Now in Maharashtra, there’s a night curfew from 8pm. How will our late night shoots happen? We have to clarify this from the government. I think only travel is restricted, work will go on. If an actor falls sick, makers can shoot the portions without them until they get fine,” he reasons.</p><p>However, according to Akshaye Rathi, exhibitor, this same solution cannot be applied to just about every film. “There’s a possibility that scenes that require other actors and not the lead are shot on a location which is inaccessible due to restrictions. Most of these lead actors have a king’s share of screen space in any film. If any of them falls sick, they are out of action for 15-20 days. It won’t result in complete closure of shoot, but there would be a massive lockdown, and therefore loss of money on the shoot,” he says.</p><p><b>Interact with the author on Twitter/ <a href=""https://twitter.com/rishabhsuri02?lang=en"" target=""_blank"">@RishabhSuri02</a></b></p><p><b>Follow <a href=""https://twitter.com/htshowbiz?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"" target=""_blank"">@htshowbiz</a> on Twitter</b></p>","<p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/kareena-kapoor-and-saif-ali-khan-are-diva-and-the-dude-in-saba-s-new-throwback-picture-see-here-101617365448729.html"" target=""_blank"">Saif Ali Khan</a>'s sister Saba Ali Khan has become quite an ace at sharing throwback pictures of her family members.

His daughter Ekta Kapoor's success as a producer, too, has added to his fame. However, Jeetendra's name is invariably brought up whenever Hema Malini is talked about and how, back in the early 1970s, he almost got married to her! On his 79th birthday on Wednesday, here's a look at what he had said about that particular episode of his life.</p><p>Hema's biography, <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/exclusive-book-excerpt-when-a-drunk-dharmendra-landed-up-at-hema-malini-and-jeetendra-s-wedding/story-caxdWsJHUOuFvyAkP95zZO.html"" target=""_blank"">Beyond The Dream Girl</a>, narrated the entire episode - her parents had been totally against her dating a much-married Dharmendra. Jeetendra and she not only had a good relationship as co-stars, they were good friends too. Jeetendra had been known to have to a soft spot for Hema, though he was seeing Shobha then. And while Hema liked him, she wasn't romantically inclined. It was in this context that Hema's mother thought of getting her daughter married off to tide over the crisis. As the word reached Jeetendra's household, his parents were ecstatic and he was willing to give in to his family's desires.</p><p>A secret wedding was planned in Chennai and both families flew down. A local paper got wind of it and published the scoop as front page news. A slightly drunk Dharmendra, accompanied by Jeetendra's then girlfriend and now wife, Shobha, reached the venue in time to stop the nuptials.</p><p><br></p><p>While Hema has obviously been candid about the entire episode, Jeetendra has never been as forthcoming. However, he did address the issue few years back with a leading film magazine, when asked if he had ever proposed to Hema. A <a href=""https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/nostalgia/380296/flashback-friday-jeetendra-i-d-rather-not-talk-about-hema-malini"" target=""_blank"">Pinkvilla</a> report quoted him as saying: ""I’d rather not talk about that chapter in my life. Her kids have grown up and so have mine. To talk about this now would be very awkward and embarrassing.""</p><p>Eventually, Jeetendra went on to marry Shobha, who was reportedly an air hostess with British Airways, in 1974. They have two kids together - daughter Ekta and son, Tusshar Kapoor. Hema and Dharmendra were eventually married in 1980 and have two daughters - Esha Deol and Ahana Deol - together.</p><p>Also read: <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/arjun-kapoor-asks-fans-to-spot-the-difference-between-two-of-his-pics-janhvi-kapoor-has-perfect-reply-see-here-101617694349346.html"" target=""_blank"">Arjun Kapoor asks fans to spot the difference between two of his pics, Janhvi Kapoor has perfect reply. See here</a></p><p>Jeetendra lives a quiet life in Mumbai but remains the chairman of the Balaji Telefilms, Balaji Motion Pictures and ALT Entertainment. The actor, who made his screen debut back in 1967 with a V Shantaram film, earned fame in the '60s for his dancing skills. Through the '70s, he starred in memorable films directed by Gulzar, and also featured in Bollywood-style family dramas. His crowning glory came in the 1980s, when he starred in a string of hits, which were remakes of South films. He was invariably paired with Sridevi and Jaya Prada.</p>","<p>He has dabbled in the film industry in different capacities — he wrote the story for the cult film Gangs of Wasseypur, acted in it, and directed a film called Meeruthiya Gangster, too. And recently, Zeishan Quadri produced a film called Halahal.</p><p>Like every business, films, too, demand return on investment at the end of the day. In such a scenario, has Quadri been able to do and make the kind of projects that he wants to, minus the glamour or masala associated with mainstream cinema?</p><p>He says, “It’s simple and straight. All producers want their money back and now the industry is divided into OTT and feature films. When you say you want our money back, you’re not more than a line producer when you’re doing something for an OTT, because it’s completely their thing once they buy it. They give you money to produce. But you have creative freedom, can take calls. Yahaan pe aake flop hone ki possibility kam ho gayi hai.”</p><p>And when that fear of failure is gone, he adds that the content automatically improves.</p><p>“See the kind of shows that are being made. Then there are people like me, who make small films like Halahal, with a small budget. Even after promotions, people don’t pay attention to it,” rues the 38-year-old.</p><p>Quadri also reveals that the film was snubbed at mainstream affairs.</p><p>“Critics ne bhar bhar ke Halahal ko appreciate kiya. At the same time, it didn’t go to any awards. The films which won however, you’ll laugh how they got a nomination. Film industry biased thi, hai aur rahegi. Isse mujhe na kabhi farq padha tha, nah hai aur na padhega. I’ll make the kind of cinema and films I want. Till your things aren’t appreciated by Bollywood, the name given to the film industry — when they do that, audience for our films increases. Confidence of people like us gets a boost and we make more of such films. But Rome was not built in a day,” he ends on a thoughtful note.</p>","<p>You think of Jeetendra and the first thing that comes to one’s mind is the iconic dance steps. From the fast paced Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq, Hia badminton style sporty dancing in Dhal Gaya Din, the hook and aerobic like dance steps in Naino Mein Sapna and the PT style dancing in Taki Taki, have rightfully earned him the title of Jumping Jack of Bollywood. On his 79th birthday, we talk to a few young choreographers of the country today and know how the veteran actor has inspired them.</p><p><b>Melvin Louis</b></p><p>I am a big Jeetu sir fan. Back then not just to be a dancer but to have a distinctive style come out is amazing. The kind of stuff that he did with the energy and expression and the distinctive style, his steps, his turn and walk. It is very iconic even today because that was his own peculiar style which he would add to the choreography. His name is right at the top when it comes to actors with great dancing. For me my favorite song is Dhal Gaya Din (Humjoli, 1970).</p><p><b>Raghav Juyal</b></p><p>As an actor and dance he has been always inspiring for me. From my childhood I have always looked upon on him and he is such a flawless performer that his songs makes you groove every time you see. He has given some remarkable dancing moves which I always love to do. My favourite song of Jeetu ji is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983).</p><p><b>Punit J Pathak</b></p><p>He is one of the legends as far as dancing is concerned. He is rightfully called the Jumping Jack because he was always high on energy as far as the songs were concerned. I feel any artiste is more appreciated when the person is genuine and nice so I met him a few time on a dance reality show, he was so nice. There has been no one else like him again. I personally love his song is Naino Mein Sapna (Himmatwala, 1983).</p><p><b>Kruti Mahesh</b></p><p>His style of dancing was unique. Today we see heroes and yes they are good but they try to learn different dance styles and they try and become dancers also but the era for Jeetu ji was such that he had his own style. He had such flamboyance to his dancing and there was no inhibition per say and I got one opportunity to teach him for some video that Ekta Kapoor was doing from home so we had the opportunity to do a couple of steps with him. One of my favourites is Taki O Taki (Himmatwala, 1983).</p>","<p>Actor <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/anushka-sharma-virat-kohli-inspire-a-joke-in-amitabh-bachchan-anushka-has-a-huge-apartment-101617497958222.html"" target=""_blank"">Anushka Sharma</a> has shared a video of some fun moments with her husband, cricketer Virat Kohli.

The Australian had arrived in Chennai on April 3 with a negative test report. But he tested positive in his second test on Wednesday, and will now be in isolation at a designated medical facility, a club statement said.

The 28-year-old, who is asymptomatic, has been in quarantine since his arrival in India and hadn’t made contact with any other player or RCB staff member.

Miss two games

Sams is set to miss at least the first two games for RCB, against Mumbai Indians on April 9 and Sunrisers Hyderabad on April 14.

But RCB received a boost ahead of its opener on Friday, with opener Devdutt Padikkal joining the squad. Padikkal had tested positive for COVID-19 on March 22 and was in isolation since then, with head coach Simon Katich telling the media on Tuesday that Padikkal needed just a negative test report before entering the bubble.

Ready for action

In a video released by the team on Twitter, Padikkal said, “As per BCCI and IPL protocol, I had to quarantine at home for two weeks. Now I have joined the camp after two negative tests, and I am feeling completely fine now, and I just can’t wait to get back.”","With an abundance of strengths and no obvious weakness, Rohit Sharma’s side is tipped to complete an unprecedented hat-trick of titles

They said it cannot win in the United Arab Emirates. It proved them wrong in 2020. They said it wins only during odd years. It proved them wrong in 2020.

They now say no team has won a hat-trick of IPL titles. Mumbai Indians is set to pay them no heed again, given that it enters the 14th edition as the front-runner to win a record-extending sixth crown.

Rohit Sharma’s army — oops, paltan — carries the tag of being the “the most well-prepared outfit” in the tournament’s history. It’s no wonder, therefore, that it has a ready-made replacement for each of its starting XI. Such is the bench strength that despite injuries and possible pandemic-enforced absences, MI can field a side full of international cricketers right through the season.

Two of its key batsmen — Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav — will be eager to celebrate their much-awaited international debuts by continuing to make a mockery of opposition bowlers.

And as if that weren’t enough, Hardik Pandya will resume all-round duties after featuring in the UAE purely as a batsman while he rehabilitated his back. He played the finisher’s role to perfection last edition, but this time around, having bowled full tilt during India’s T20I series against England, Hardik is set to unleash his complete potential. It really doesn’t augur well for MI’s opponents.

Lethal pace combo

While the top seven are as ferocious as any T20 batting line-up in the world, the pace combination of Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah is as lethal as it can get.

The only possible weak link is the spin department. But with leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, the third-highest wicket-taker in IPL history, having been roped in, there may be cause for optimism on two counts. Not only can Chawla be handy when called upon, he can also act as the perfect mentor for promising leggie Rahul Chahar.

Don’t be surprised if by May 30, both Chawla and Chahar have proven all their detractors wrong and are singing “Where’s the competition?” along with the rest of their teammates.","<p>Chennai Super Kings batsman Cheteshwar Pujara on Wednesday said he was honoured to receive the official kit from CSK skipper MS Dhoni, adding that he is looking forward to a ""great season"" of the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p><p>""Excited and honoured to receive the official kit from @msdhoni bhai and the @ChennaiIPL family!

Rahul Chahar has been a key member of Mumbai Indians' spin department since the 2019 season. Last year during IPL 2020 in the UAE, Chahar made great use of the conditions and picked 15 wickets in as many matches. He stemmed the run-flow in the middle overs and provided his side with crucial breakthroughs. In 2019, he bagged 13 wickets. Overall, Chahar has 30 wickets to his name after 31 IPL matches. He comes into this tournament high on confidence from an impressive Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he took 11 wickets in 5 matches.

Afghanistan's Rashid Khan, without a shred of a doubt, is one of the most dangerous bowlers in the Indian Premier League currently. The Sunrisers Hyderabad spinner, since his debut IPL season in 2017, Rashid has impressed one and all with his mastery, deception, variations. In the last season, he was the sixth-highest wicket-taker with 20 wickets in 16 matches, including the best bowling spell of 3/7. He was the second-most successful spinner in the edition, one behind Yuzvendra Chahal. With IPL returning to India, Rashid Khan is expected to be his at economical best.

The leg-spinner, heading into his 9th season, has almost become a veteran of sorts. With 121 IPL career wickets in 99 games, Chahal is placed ninth in the all-time highest wicket-takers list. He was the best spinner in the previous edition with 21 wickets in 15 matches with a healthy economy rate of 7.08. He finished as the franchise's most successful bowler in 2019, picking 18 wickets in 14 games. To put his consistency into context, the Indian spinner has not finished lower than 2nd in the wickets tally for RCB since 2015. Even though he had a subdued T20I series against England and didn't get picked for the ODIs, he continues to remain an extremely crucial member of the side.</p><p><strong>R. Ashwin:</strong> What a past few months this man is having. A breakthrough of sorts tour of Australia where he played a memorable innings alongside Hanuma Vihari to save the Sydney Test. Back home against England, he was taking five-wicket hauls at will to go with another Test century on home ground in Chennai. Delhi Capitals' R.

Another bowler who picked up five-wicket hauls at will. Ashwin recently stated his desire to play white-ball cricket for India. While many pundits and former players have reduced him to a Test specialist, Ashwin's skills are still as good as any when it comes to limited-overs cricket. Last season, despite sitting out a few games due to a shoulder injury, he returned with 14 wickets from 15 matches. In the 11 seasons he has played so far, the Tamil Nadu all-rounder has bagged 138 wickets in 154 matches. He is currently the sixth-highest wicket-taker in the league's history.</p><p><strong>Varun Chakravarthy:</strong> Due to outstanding figures of 17 wickets in 13 matches during his first full-fledged IPL season in UAE, the Tamil Nadu leg spinner Varun Chakravarthy became an essential part of the team. He has several variations up his sleeve and was picked up by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2020 to beef up their spin bowling department and he delivered. This earned him his maiden India call-up for the Australian Tour but he missed out due to an injury. Earlier this year, he was picked for the T20I series against England but he didn’t make the cut eventually as he failed to clear the fitness test multiple times. This decision sparked a raging debate on social media, with former cricketers and pundits criticizing the management for being too strict.

Add Ishant Sharma to that list (Didn’t play last season due to injury) and the pace attack is unrivalled.</p><p><strong>Explosive finishers</strong></p><p>With the likes of Rishabh Pant, Marcus Stoinis, Shimron Hetmyer &amp; Axar Patel in the middle and lower middle-order, the finishing power of DC is one of the finest. While Stoinis can play anywhere and Pant’s current form make him among the most dangerous finishers in the game, Hetmyer can build the innings and go hammer and tongs towards the end.</p><p><strong>Weakness</strong></p><p><strong>Wicket-keeping options</strong></p><p>Barring Pant there is no recognised Indian keeper in the side. While Vishnu Vinod is a viable option, but his finishing abilities are nowhere near Pant. New recruit Sam Billings is another option that is available but to bring in an overseas player, the entire composition of the team will have to be changed.</p><p><strong>Lack of quality all-rounders</strong></p><p>Axar Patel and Marcus Stoinis are the only 2 renowned IPL All-rounders DC have in their team. If any one of them were to get injured during the season they might have to depend on the likes of Lalit Yadav or Ripal Patel. Chris Woakes is another option they can turn too but he has been a no-show in the last couple of seasons.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/jasprit-bumrah-bhuvneshwar-kumar-kagiso-rabada-kyle-jamieson-chris-morris-top-5-seamers-to-watch-out-for-in-ipl-2021-101617761690180.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>IPL 2021 - Two of India's best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watch</strong></a></p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p><p><strong>Opening Spot</strong></p><p>DC is a squad who have no less than 4 openers in Dhawan, Shaw, Rahane, Smith. Stoinis as we know has done a great job opening the innings in the shortest form of the game. Looking at previous year’s performances, Dhawan will most probably keep his place but his partner’s place is up for grabs. Shaw will come into the side with a record-breaking Vijay Hazare trophy and will be eager to get his spot back. Smith has proven he can be as good as an opener in T20s.</p><p><strong>Billings/Hetmyer</strong></p><p>Both billings and Hetmyer fit the bill for the middle-order’s slot. While still untested in the IPL, Billings has shown glimpses of what he can do for England, Hetmyer too didn’t do his reputation any harm in the last season of IPL.</p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p><strong>Injury List</strong></p><p>Ishant Sharma, Ashwin, Amit Mishra, Umesh Yadav are all prone to injury. If both Ishant and Umesh were to be injured, the 3rd pacer syndrome will catch up once again to DC. An injury to Amit Mishra and Ravi Ashwin will leave Axar Patel alone like last season. Though they have youngsters like Meriwala, Siddharth and Pravin Dubey to call upon but they sure won’t be as impactful as the senior pros.</p>","<p>Big-hitting Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell says being continuously confined to bio-bubbles can become a ""nightmare"" and cricketers are leading a ""difficult lifestyle"" right now to ensure that they continue to do their job.</p><p>Maxwell, who had his share of problems with mental fatigue in the past, admitted that adjusting to such a life amid the COVID-19 pandemic is definitely taking a toll on players around the world.</p><p>""It's very difficult (to move from one bubble to other)...you being sheltered from people outside your bio-secure bubble and you get stuck into this never-ending nightmare where you are living the same day over and over again,"" he said in an interview posted by his IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore on its youtube channel.</p><p>""You almost tend to forget how to have a normal conversation with the outside world.

Yadav was not a prodigy; he was a powerful player with a major weakness--he did not have shots to offer on the off side.</p><p>Then there were allegations of dressing room strife, indiscipline, being hauled up by the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) once for questioning his exclusion from the state's one-day team (and included only after tendering an apology).

He waited.</p><p>“When I got to know that I would be making my debut I actually went 8-10 years down the line,” Yadav said over the phone. “I was thinking about my debut for Mumbai in 2010, coming into the Mumbai Indians setup in 2011 and getting to learn a lot in those three years. Then in 2014, when I went to another franchise, I got an opportunity to experience that format before playing first-class regularly. Then when I came back to Mumbai Indians in 2018, I thought this is the right time for me. I’m experienced enough. It’s high time I take a step forward and be harsh on myself.”</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/will-rishabh-pant-lead-delhi-capitals-dc-to-their-maiden-ipl-title-kapil-dev-gives-fascinating-answer-101617764370849.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Will Pant lead DC to their maiden IPL title? Kapil Dev gives fascinating answer</strong></a></p><p>And so he did.</p><p>He signed up for an unforgiving diet to become leaner. Eight years after he had already become a top-level professional, he began to transform his game, strengthen his off-side strokes. He trained at ungodly hours for specific results, asked friends to give throwdowns during the lockdown and even stepped up to the intimidating challenge of opening the batting for Mumbai Indians. This, while averaging over 44 in 77 first-class matches for Mumbai.</p><p>It yielded spectacular results, reviving a career that was going nowhere special. At KKR, between 2014 and 2017, Yadav aggregated 164, 157, 182 and 105 runs. The next three seasons at Mumbai Indians, Yadav scored 512, 424 and 480. It was impossible to ignore Yadav’s transformation after the 2020 IPL. He finally made his India debut against England last month, blasting a 31-ball 57 in his second T20I, batting at the coveted No 3 position. Next match, he scored 32 off 17. With Virat Kohli revealing his wish to open for India, Yadav knows the No 3 could be his for the T20 World Cup later this year, but he is not willing to overthink. “I’m really flexible,” he said. “My debut game for India, even though I didn’t bat, I was supposed to bat No 6 or 7 with Hardik. In the next game I got to bat at No 3. So I was happy.”</p><p>One man who worked with Yadav through his transformation was Mumbai Indians head coach Mahela Jayawardene, who first saw the spark that convinced him to promote Yadav up the order.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/jasprit-bumrah-bhuvneshwar-kumar-kagiso-rabada-kyle-jamieson-chris-morris-top-5-seamers-to-watch-out-for-in-ipl-2021-101617761690180.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Two of India's best, 3 lethal overseas quicks: Top 5 seamers to watch out for in IPL 2021</strong></a></p><p>""We thought that his skill, technique and game awareness probably suited to opening the batting, which he started with us,” Jayawardene said. “And then bat at No 3 and 4 where he can control the innings, especially in the middle overs. I think he has flourished in that role.""</p><p>This is where changing some fundamental aspects of his old game became critical.</p><p>“Initially he was a player who would use the pace and probably play behind the wicket but over the last 2-3 years he has completely changed that,” said Jayawardene. “He can play in front, covering more areas. He has more ammunition to work with. He has become pretty much a very complete player.”</p><p>Effecting basic technical changes almost 8-9 years into first-class cricket isn’t easy. The muscle memory makes it difficult to unlearn before getting wired to the new way. “Surya was willing to change, he was willing to do the work,” said Jayawardene. “Not all players would want to change like that. They would probably back their instincts and say ‘Oh this is the way I have played so far and I just want to continue’. It’s entirely up to the player.""</p><p><br></p><p>“You can’t be a one-dimensional player batting higher up the order,” said Yadav. “You have to bring in that change. You have to, because this is played at such an international level that people pick your strong and weak points very easily.”</p><p>Yadav was always a sweet timer of the ball; and to compensate for his off-side weakness, he could always fall back on his strengths: cheeky ramp shots, sweeps and scoops.</p><p>“I didn’t think too much about the outcome. It was just about practising normal drives, normal cuts and slowly it was built into my muscle memory,"" Yadav said. ""I wasn’t too hard on myself. One day I was batting with a blank mind. And I actually did it.”</p><p>If he took to the acquisition of new skills with an easy mind, for his physical transformation he went the other way.</p><p>“After 2018, I sat with our trainer Paul Chapman and decided the boxes that needed to be ticked going into the next season. He said ‘If you are batting higher up the order, you need to bat at least 15 overs if you play really well in that game. And you also have to field for 20 overs.’ I had never done that before,” said Yadav. “I only batted for 10-15 balls (at KKR) and fielded for 20 overs. So this was a completely different scenario for me. I had to be prepared for 2019.”</p><p>Yadav began to challenge his body, fighting his comfort zone.</p><p>""I used to train in the evening when it used to be a little cooler. I changed that to two in the afternoon,” said Yadav. Realising the importance of middle overs when spinners operate, Yadav started batting on Mumbai’s red soil turners right in the middle of the day. “I started practising in the afternoon, between 12-3 pm when the pitches are very dry. That helped me a lot in improving my game against spin.”</p><p>Being hard on himself was redemptive, given Yadav’s pretty topsy-turvy career till 2017. There was an on-field fracas with Mumbai teammate Shardul Thakur in 2014. He lost Mumbai’s captaincy as well. The IPL too wasn’t offering him many chances at that time. But Yadav’s faith in the game wasn’t shaken.</p><p>Things first started falling in place in 2018 when Yadav started to bat at No 4 for Mumbai Indians. “Then the team management came up to me and asked if I would like to open the innings. I said ‘Yes, 100%’. I took that as a challenge. I came from a different setup, batting at a completely different position. Coming here, batting higher for such a big team, I took it as a challenge which later on became a responsibility. It wasn’t easy when I came into the setup. But Mahela and Sachin sir said ‘you don’t have to do anything different. Do what you have been doing and enjoy your time in the middle’.”</p><p>“I did exactly that. And never looked back.”</p><p>If the 2018 IPL was a sign of the changes to come, 2020 was really where Yadav was at the peak of his ability, thriving in the role of a finisher at No 3. He averaged 40 at a strike rate of 145, both career best numbers in the IPL. He also hit 61 boundaries, the most by a Mumbai Indians batsman and 15 more than Quinton de Kock, the next best boundary hitter. Yadav finally knows his game. He knows he can take his time. That's what makes him more menacing in the death overs. “There are power hitters in this team. It makes my job easier. I don’t need to do anything out of the box and fill in their shoes. I just need to be myself.""</p>","<p>At 33, Dawid Malan will be a late debutant at the Indian Premier League (IPL).

That’s why you see a lot of Australians play in general, because there are so many Australian coaches.</p><p>Secondly, my primary aim has been to play Test cricket for England and keep doing that. But playing Test cricket for England means you don’t put your name in the IPL because you have to play the first six to eight four-day games of the year which is at the same time as the IPL. That played a massive factor.</p><p><strong>You said your primary focus is playing Tests. Batsmen are increasingly straddling formats better...you've got lots of players going straight from T20 to Tests</strong></p><p>The times are changing but if you look at the best T20 players in the world, you see the likes of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Chris Gayle. They have all played close to 100 Test matches. They have all mastered the basic fundamentals by playing the longer format of the game for an extended period of time.</p><p>I think sometimes the young kids who are watching or playing too much of white ball cricket do not have the basics right; if things don’t go their way they don’t have anything to fall back on. Test cricket is the fundamental (form). The mindset has changed now. Obviously there is more glamour, more finance, less time away from home, less time on the feet. You can see that trend. If you don’t have the fundamentals right, you have nothing to fall back on if you fail in T20 cricket.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to handle the huge expectations around you?</strong></p><p>The criticism and expectation are part of the game. We are all humans. There will be days when you will play like you haven’t picked the bat ever, and then there will be days when you hit everything out of the park. You have to block out the noise.

Eoin Morgan spoke about that before we departed for the series against India. We have players who have not played much cricket in India, though they have played in other countries. It (IPL) gives you the opportunity to work with the Indian legends, to improve on certain things, to pick up a few things if you do manage to find a place in the squad for the World Cup. It showed in the way the Indian guys who played in IPL and then made their debut against us. That’s the same for us whether we are 34 or 35, you should be open to learning.

Jasprit Bumrah (27) and Trent Boult (25), from the championship-winning side Mumbai Indians, finished second and third respectively.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/aakash-chopra-picks-ideal-delhi-capitals-dc-xi-for-ipl-2021-leaves-out-their-two-costliest-buys-steve-smith-and-tom-curran-101617760362296.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>No place for DC's costliest buys of IPL 2021 in Chopra's ideal Delhi Capitals XI</strong></a></p><p>IPL is back to India and with matches slated to take place at six venues--Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and New Delhi--- expect the spinners to have a bigger say but the pacers continue to hold the aces.</p><p><strong>Also watch | IPL 2021: Will Covid surge affect tournament? BCCI vice-president answers</strong></p><p><strong><span class=""ql-cursor"">﻿</span></strong></p><p>Before the action begins, let's take a look at top bowlers to watch out for:</p><p><strong>1) Jasprit Bumrah</strong></p><p>The leader of Mumbai's bowling pack is Jasprit Bumrah. The right-arm pacer has finished as the defending champions' highest-wicket taker for the last two seasons with 19 and 27 wickets, respectively. In 2017, he finished second in the list with 17 wickets, just one behind Hardik Pandya. Bumrah's pace and movement up front and pin-point accuracy at the death makes him one of the most dangerous bowlers in the league. His companion Trent Boult finished with 25 wickets in 2020, making the duo even more lethal. Mumbai will hope to see Bumrah find his rhythm at the earliest as he will be playing his first game after a month-long break. He didn't feature in the T20I and ODI series against England due to personal reasons. In 92 IPL matches, Bumrah has picked 109 wickets at an economy of 7.41.</p><p><strong>2) Kagiso Rabada</strong></p><p>Delhi Capitals reaching the final in the UAE in 2020 was largely possible due to Proteas pacer Kagiso Rabada. The speedster bagged 30 wickets and won the Purple Cap. Interestingly Rabada was retained by the Delhi side in 2019 despite not featuring in a single game during the previous season. However, Delhi struck gold with the decision as Rabada went on to take 25 wickets and finish the season as the team's highest wicket-taker. Rabada left the ongoing Pakistan-SA ODI series midway, during which he picked up two wickets in two matches, to join his IPL franchise on time. Twenty-six-year-old Rabada 61 wickets from 35 IPL games. He will once again be the key for the Delhi side in the IPL 2021 as they look to go one better than last year and finally win the elusive trophy.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/sourav-ganguly-remembers-biggest-setback-of-his-career-when-he-was-stripped-of-his-captaincy-101617758885905.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>‘You have to bite the bullet’: Ganguly remembers biggest setback of career</strong></a></p><p><strong>3) Bhuvneshwar Kumar</strong></p><p>He is the kind of figure you need to lead your bowling attack. A calm, composed, and focussed individual who quietly goes about his business-- that is to take wickets--but creates maximum noise and buzz around him. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the Purple Cap winner in the 2016 season with 23 wickets as Sunrisers Hyderabad lifted their first IPL title. A dangerous swing bowler who is often called one of the most skillful white-ball bowlers in the world, Bhuvi, simply put, just a difficult bowler to put away. He may not be the quickest of the lot but he's definitely got enough trick up his sleeves to cause damage towards the end of the innings. He featured in the recently-concluded white-ball leg of the India-England series. He started off slow but began to increase his wicket-tally pretty quickly towards the end and his pristine economy rate only made his team's life easier</p><p><strong>4) Kyle Jamieson</strong></p><p>We are going to talk about three massive talking points of the IPL 2021 auction, who all happen to be pacers, but let's begin with New Zealand Kyle Jamieson. Standing tall at 6'8"", the Kiwi speedster entered the auction at a base price of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>75 lakh but came out with a <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>15 crore contract from the Royal Challengers Bangalore. While he started off his career in Test cricket, Jamieson has also been inducted into the white-ball sides in the last few months. He's played six Tests, five ODIs, and eight T20Is and it is interesting to note he only made his T20I debut months after making his Test debut. In all T20s, the 26-year-old has pocketed 55 wickets in 42 matches and his height and bounce will come in handy for RCB.</p><p><strong>5) Chris Morris</strong></p><p>On February 18, 2021, Chris Morris became the most expensive player in the history of the league when he was bought for <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>16.25 at the auction. In 2020, he represented RCB, picking 11 wickets and scoring 34 runs in nine matches. He was bought for <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>10 crore from the Delhi franchise ahead of the 2020 season. The all-rounder is 34 now and it will be important for his workload to be managed properly. He has faced multiple layoffs due to injuries in the past and Rajasthan Royals wouldn't want to see such a player on the sidelines. He is an experienced campaigner in this league, having played 70 matches with 80 in his kitty at an economy rate of 7.81. Now that Jofra Archer has been ruled out of the first half due to a hand injury, the onus will be on Morris to spearhead the pace attack</p>","<p>Young wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant has become the talk of the town ever since he was named Delhi Capitals captain for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

They lack a specialist pacer who can bowl 140 clicks or bowls in the death overs, which makes SRH a bowling unit which relies on medium pace and spin dependent attack.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p><p><strong>High time for Indian players to prove their worth</strong></p><p>Vijay Shankar, who was retained by the team, has faded away after a brief stint with the national team. The likes of Abhishek Sharma and Priyam Garg also haven't been consistent. The team has punted on Team India discard Kedar Jadhav. All these players have a chance to prove their worth this season for the team.</p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p><strong>Injury concerns</strong></p><p>Last season saw SRH face multiple injuries to their first-choice players which created many holes in the squad. Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Vijay Shankar, and Wriddhiman Saha were the key players who were injured and have persisted with injuries throughout their career. It would be interesting to see how management handles these players throughout the season.</p>","<p>Kolkata Knight Riders' campaign in the last two seasons of the IPL was quite similar. They started off by hitting the right notes but all the tuning seemed to go haywire as the tournament progressed. Their decision to switch captains from Dinesh Karthik to Eoin Morgan mid-way through the tournament last year did not yield the desired result but Morgan is a proven customer and one can hope that he would bounce back strong this year.</p><p>Barring Morgan, Shakib Al Hasan and Pat Cummins, KKR don’t have anyone who can claim to be a superstar of international cricket currently but in Andre Russell, Shubman Gill, Sunil Narine and a young pace attack comprising Prasidh Krishna, Shivam Mavi and Kamlesh Nagarkoti, they have a pretty well-balanced side.</p><p>KKR full squad for IPL 2021: <strong>Shubman Gill, Rahul Tripathi, Karun Nair, Eoin Morgan (F), Nitish Rana, Gurkeerat Mann Singh, Tim Seifert (F), Dinesh Karthik, Sheldon Jackson, Andre Russell (F), Shakib Al Hasan (F), Ben Cutting (F), Venkatesh Iyer, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine (F), Harbhajan Singh, Pawan Negi, Vaibhav Arora, Pat Cummins (F), Lockie Ferguson (F), Prasidh Krishna, Sandeep Warrier, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh Nagarkoti</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><p><strong>The Spin department</strong></p><p>KKR have two of the most experienced IPL spinners in Sunil Narine and Harbhajan Singh. Then there is Varun Chakravarthy, who has proven his worth last season carrying the load of KKR spin department. Shakib al Hasan is a match-winner on his day. Kuldeep Yadav may have lost some form but on his day, he can be a wicket-taker.</p><p><strong>Foreign Contingent</strong></p><p>KKR’s foreign contingent is one of the best if not the best in IPL 2021. Sunil Narine and Andre Russell can win a match on their own. Pat Cummins and Lockie Ferguson have been consistent enough to warrant a place in the starting XI. Shakib was a part of the successful KKR and SRH sides. Tim Seifert and Ben Cutting are one of the best foreign back-ups a team could ask for.</p><p><strong>Weakness</strong></p><p><strong>Wicket-keeping options</strong></p><p>Barring Dinesh Karthik there is no recognised Indian wicket keeper in the side. While Sheldon Jackson is a viable option, his batting abilities are pale compared to Dinesh Karthik. Tim Seifert is another option that is available for KKR but being an opening batsman and an overseas player, the entire complexion of the team will have to be changed to accommodate him.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p><p><strong>Replacing Sunil Narine</strong></p><p>Sunil Narine has been mediocre at best in recent years but has won sporadic matches for KKR. If KKR are ready to changing the opening pair to Tripathi and Gill – which they did in the backend of last IPL - Shakib could be the perfect candidate to replace Sunil Narine. If they need a seam bowling option, they have Ben Cutting. His lower order hitting will provide Andre Russell more freedom.</p><p><strong>Young pace bowlers to shine</strong></p><p>Prasidh Krishna, Shivam Mavi, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Sandeep Warrier and Vaibhav Arora are some young pacers who will be looking to break into the starting XI for KKR.</p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p><strong>Sunil Narine and Andre Russell</strong></p><p>The Sunil Narine opening experiment has failed more times than it has succeeded. If KKR continue to stick with Narine opening the innings, it pushes all the players down a position which in turn, hampers the KKR batting line up. Andre Russell is one of the biggest hitters in world cricket right now and KKR’s best death bowler. His inconsistency and fitness will keep KKR management on its toes.</p><p><strong>Form of the Spinners</strong></p><p>Though the spin department is one of KKR’s core strengths, their form may be a cause of worry. Sunil Narine is not as effective after his action came under scrutiny. Varun Chakravarthy would be coming back from an injury, Harbhajan Singh is lacking match practice, Kuldeep Yadav is still struggling to find a place in the T20 set-up. KKR will have to be wary of picking the right spin combination going into the tournament.</p>","<p>India has seen massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the recent month.

Easily the most successful team in franchise cricket, the five-time, yes, five-time IPL champions are appearing more formidable and if we may use the word, unbeatable, with each season. IPL 2020 was probably the most one-sided affair, with MI first topping the points-table before going on to win the title, almost a replica of Chennai Super Kings' campaign in 2011. Last year, they broke the odd-even pattern and this year, will be looking to do what no other IPL team has done before, win a hat-trick of titles.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><p>For years now, MI's strength has lied in their core. The proven performers – the likes of Rohit Sharma at the top, big-hitters Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard and Krunal Pandya in the middle order and Jasprit Bumrah at the top. If that isn't intimidating enough, add the likes of Quinton de Kock, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav and Trent Boult. Opposition, beware. Furthermore, each one of those players enters the IPL 2021 on the back of splendid T20 form – Pollard having recently hit six sixes against Sri Lanka, Suryakumar and Ishan enjoying successful limited-overs leg against England. Bumrah is the only big match player who may be lacking match practice but, in a tournament, as long as the IPL, it's never a bad time to get some quality game time.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/sanju-samson-says-he-got-messages-from-from-virat-kohli-ms-dhoni-after-he-became-rajasthan-royals-rr-captain-ahead-of-ipl-2021-101617672938637.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sanju Samson interview: 'Got texts from Kohli, Dhoni after becoming RR captain'</strong></a></p><p><strong>Weakness</strong></p><p>There isn't much scope of weakness for a time that's won the IPL five times – twice in a row in 2019 and 2020. But if one is to nitpick, it would be the uncertainty regarding those who are benches. Year in and year out, with the MI XI almost picking itself, plenty of players are benches. Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Anmolpreet Singh, Saurabh Tiwary from last year and newest recruits Nathan Coulter-Nile, Adam Milne, James Neesham, Piyush Chawla, Arjun Tendulkar this season. Another area MI need to be cautious about is their start. Although it wasn't a concern last year, MI have had the tendency to lose a lot of matches in the first half of the tournament, which forces them to play catch-up in the other. They'd want to avoid that banana peel.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p><p>The biggest opportunity MI have this year is to create history – by becoming the first team in the IPL to win three consecutive seasons. Besides, MI would want to hand out opportunities to players like Neesham, Milne and Tendulkar jr. The formidable MI have all bases covered; all that's left now is execution. Personally, IPL 2021 will provide an idea of Hardik's role and whether is fit enough to bowl four overs, especially having not bowled a single over last year.</p><p><strong>Also Read |</strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/ricky-ponting-recalls-episode-of-prithvi-shaw-refusing-to-bat-in-delhi-capitals-nets-during-last-ipl-despite-lean-patch-101617674410706.html"" target=""_blank""><strong> 'No, I'm not batting': Ponting on when Shaw refused to bat in DC nets</strong></a></p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p>We saw it with CSK last year.

Maxwell has dealt with this kind of scrutiny ever since Mumbai Indians paid <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>5.3 crore to make him the top buy in the 2013 auction. Barring the 552 runs he aggregated in 2014 for Kings XI Punjab, the Aussie all-rounder has crossed 200 only once—310 in 2017.</p><p>In IPL 2020, playing for Kings XI in the UAE was a harrowing experience for him. Bought at the auction for <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>10.75 crore, he endured his worst IPL campaign in the last six seasons, scoring just 108 runs in 11 innings at an average of 15.43. He just couldn’t find his hitting range, failing to hit a single six from the 106 balls he faced.</p><p>Maxwell has not admitted the price tag affects him. An indicator that it does play on his mind though can be seen in his performances for Australia and BBL franchises. He came into IPL 2020 after a sterling show in white-ball cricket for Australia in England. And immediately after the poor IPL, he was in his elements again when he turned out for Australia. Maxwell scored at a strike-rate of 150 in the Australia-India T20I series, the first event after IPL.</p><p>The key for him will be how he starts this IPL. A slow start will add to the pressure with run-dollar comparisons coming in.</p><p><strong>MOST EXPENSIVE</strong></p><p>There will be even more scrutiny on Morris. The most expensive player in IPL auction history, the South African bowling all-rounder has been brought in by Rajasthan Royals to boost their bowling. The 33-year-old has fitness issues and doesn’t play much cricket outside of the T20 leagues. His last stint with RCB was hampered by injury and he was available only for nine matches, in which he took 11 wickets and scored 34 runs. While he has great skills with the ball, since 2017 Morris has never managed to get through a full IPL season.</p><p>Ahead of the tournament, Morris said he can handle the price tag. “It’s natural to have a little bit of added pressure when something like that has happened (top buy of IPL). I would be lying if I said there wasn't any pressure. But fortunately enough, in the past I have come in with quite a big price tag on my head,” he said. “You got to perform on the field, no matter what your price tag is. There is a little bit of added pressure, but the pressure you get from a price tag doesn't affect you on a cricket field at the end of the day,” he said in a press conference.</p><p><strong>JOURNEYMAN TO TOP BUY</strong></p><p>It can be an even bigger challenge when a journeyman in domestic cricket is thrust into the limelight. It has more to do with the dynamics of auction than the players’ true worth as various franchises enter a bidding war and the price escalates. Among the Indian players, this season the limelight is on Gowtham, who finds himself in the situation Pawan Negi and Jaydev Unadkat were once in.</p><p></p><p>Gowtham is versatile and can bowl during any stage of the game, with the new ball or during death overs. He can be effective with the bat as well. But his price tag means, he will constantly be under the spotlight. He does thrive under pressure, but even the most strong-willed have been weighed down by the price tag. Besides, Chennai Super Kings being forced to play all matches away from spin-friendly MA Chidambaram Stadium may not help Gowtham or England all-rounder Moeen Ali.</p><p>Gowtham though can take a cue from Unadkat, who was weighed down by the tag. The left-arm pacer’s value in T20 cricket shot up after he took 24 wickets at an economy rate of 7.02 from 12 matches, playing for Rising Pune Supergiants in 2017. In January that year, when Rajasthan Royals bought him for <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>11.5 crore, he became the most expensive Indian player in that auction. The result: In 2018, in 15 matches for RR, he took 11 wickets at an economy of 9.65.</p><p><strong>Also Read | Sanju Samson interview: 'Got texts from Kohli, Dhoni after becoming RR captain'</strong></p><p>In an interview to Cricinfo, Unadkat spoke about the pressure of being seen as a failed investment even before the halfway stage of IPL 2018. “I knew that if I did not perform well, people would say money did this, money did that. I was told IPL money comes with a lot of burden, expectations, so this was on my mind. I wanted to fight it, to ensure it’s not actually a burden, that the money factor doesn't really affect you if you are aware of it. After a couple of years, I can say that there were instances where I did feel the burden,” said Unadkat.</p><p>Pawan Negi’s problem was that the left-arm spinner’s price shot up after he delivered at CSK as Dhoni, known as a spinner’s captain, got the best out of him. Ahead of the IPL 2016, he made headlines after the Delhi franchise bought him for a whopping <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>8.5 crore. But in the eight matches he played, he took one wicket and had an expensive economy rate of 9.33.</p><p>The advantage Gowtham has is he has taken the opposite route. He will play under Dhoni this time. “I don't feel any pressure of expectations playing for a champion side like CSK. It’s dream come true for me to be playing under Mahi bhai,” the off-spinner said.</p><p><strong>SPECIFIC ROLES</strong></p><p>Franchises who have splurged money this season see specific roles for their top buys and feel they have got the right players.</p><p>Morris is good with the new ball and in the death overs. There will be added pressure on him with Jofra Archer missing the initial part of IPL due to injury. Morris can also hit sixes coming down the order.</p><p>Likewise, the second biggest buy Jamieson is an unknown quantity as he hasn't played much outside New Zealand. But RCB have spent <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>15 crore on him to bolster their overseas bowling department. Jamieson has done well in Tests, and how he does in the shortest format remains to be seen.</p><p>RCB’s director of cricket, Mike Hesson, the former New Zealand coach, feels the bounce Jamieson can extract due to his height will be useful. “Certain bowlers thrive in certain conditions. There will be some grounds where the ball will swing and bounce, and in those instances, Jamieson will be deadly in terms of what he can do. Once again, it is a complement of skills in terms of the balance we require on certain days. He is a power-hitter with the bat... That said, we won’t rely on one player… Putting out a highly competitive XI will be the key,” said the RCB boss.</p><p>Hesson feels Maxwell is a perfect fit as he can accelerate, which they struggle to do once AB de Villiers and Virat Kohli are out. “He is a fantastic player. We want some X-factor players...especially through the middle overs, and having high-impact cricketers like Maxwell adds to the value that an AB de Villiers brings, and potentially at the back end as well.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/ipls-home-test-amid-rising-cases-101617676191810.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>IPL’s home test amid rising cases</strong></a></p><p>“On his day, he (Maxwell) can turn the game on its head. We need to use him in a space where we can maximise his skills... He is already clear about his role in the team, but spending some time with people he is going to be batting with will help him understand his role implicitly... Also, from a bowling point of view, he adds some good skills, and he is an amazing fielder as well...” said Hesson.</p><p><strong>CSK’S SPIN FOCUS</strong></p><p>CSK have spent <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>16.25 crore to bring off-spinning all-rounders Gowtham ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>9.25 crore) and Moeen Ali ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>7 crore). Dhoni likes to have spinners on his roster. Both can be seen as replacements for Harbhajan Singh. Besides them, he has Mitchell Santner, Ravindra Jadeja, Karn Sharma, R Sai Kishore and Imran Tahir.</p><p>Moeen is a more conventional off-spinner and a handy lower-middle order batsman, who balances the need for bowling flexibility and batting depth.</p><p><strong>PUNJAB’S PACE ADDITIONS</strong></p><p>Punjab Kings have gone the other way, adding a couple of Australian quickies in Richardson ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>14 crore) and Riley Meredith ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>8 crore). Both can crank it up, bowl consistently over 140kph. This is an area Kings struggled in last season with their overseas quicks failing.</p><p>Richardson, after undergoing a couple of shoulder surgeries, is back in his pomp; he was the top wicket-taker in BBL.

He couldn’t resist sharing the news with his close circle—his parents and wife Charu. “It was tough keeping it to myself,” he said with a smile. After it was officially announced, a few text messages gave the 26-year-old “special little moments” to cherish. “I got some nice congratulatory messages from Virat bhai, Rohit bhai and Mahi bhai,” the soft-spoken Samson recalled.</p><p>In this chat with HT ahead of the 2021 IPL season, the wicketkeeper-batsman from Kerala talks about his take on leadership, having Kumar Sangakkara—RR's director of cricket—to support him in his new role and why he wouldn’t want to place too much emphasis on RR’s latest and most expensive recruit, Chris Morris. Excerpts:</p><p><strong>You’ve captained Kerala, its U-19 team and also the India U-19 team once before. What has your leadership experience been like?</strong></p><p>I look at captaincy as more of a service to the team. A captain is someone who is there to provide the right kind of atmosphere that every individual requires in a team and backs each one of them. It’s a lot about man-management skills—giving positive feedback to your players, understanding where they are coming from. The fact that my team and the franchise trust me to do this job gives great confidence that there is something in me. I firmly believe that a captain is only good if the team is good. The Royals have a quality bunch of great players and amazing support staff backing them. I’ve known most of them for years; they are like family. So, I’m in a comfortable space with the people I have around me. I have been part of the Royals from my teen days in 2013. Playing for one team for this long to now becoming captain, it’s a proud moment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Having someone like Sangakkara around must be a boon…</strong></p><p>Sanga is a legend; not just because of his cricket. He is a wonderful person to interact with. That takes a lot of pressure off me. When we had our first chat, I just felt I was blessed to be with him. He knows exactly where I am coming from, what I will be feeling and going through playing for my country and leading an IPL team at this age. I couldn’t have asked for anything more than having Sanga as my partner in this role.</p><p><strong>This IPL will see four wicketkeeper-batsmen lead their respective teams. Do you feel it is too many hats to don being a wicketkeeper-batsman and captain?</strong></p><p>It’s about how you take it, really. I’ve always felt a wicketkeeper is the best judge on a cricket field. He can see a lot more things, analyse the game better and is one step ahead. If you feel it’s too much to work around, it might get complicated. If you feel you’re in the best position to lead the team as a wicketkeeper, then it becomes a lot easier. I treat it as the latter.</p><p><strong>RR finished last in the previous season. What's your vision for the team in this new season?</strong></p><p>I don't think we did too much wrong in the last season. If you look at our XI on paper, we're one of the best. So I would like to tell everyone that we are a great bunch of players and we just need to play some good cricket. If we are in the right mindset as a team, I believe good things are ahead of us. This format demands a lot of fearless cricket, be it in batting, bowling or fielding. It's all about speed, power and expressing yourself. That's what I expect from my team.</p><p><strong>How big a role do you see Chris Morris playing in the team, especially in the absence of Jofra Archer at least for some part of the season?</strong></p><p>I would not like to put him (Morris) under too much pressure or tell him that he's the biggest member of this team. Everyone has a big role to play; even someone bowling one over might have a crucial role. But we're excited to have Morris back. He’s a very happy-go-lucky person, someone who likes to keep the atmosphere light. But when he enters the ground, he is a completely different person—competitive and eager to win matches. It’s great to have an individual like that in the team.</p>","<p>All-rounder Krunal Pandya is gearing up for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

RCB’s Devdutt Padikkal has remained in home isolation since testing positive.</p><p>There are still question marks though over the transparency of the process. “KKR made Rana’s case public only after he had completed his isolation period and tested negative. RCB issued a statement on Padikkal 14 days after his testing positive. That’s only after realising that his recovery was taking longer. Franchises need to realise that members testing positive is in itself not a cause for alarm. Keeping it transparent helps build confidence among participants,” a senior franchise official who did not wish to be named, said.</p><p>In the case of the 12 Wankhede ground staff, some returned positive from tests done on March 26, others from tests on April 1. It’s not known if immediate contact tracing was done. Fifteen other ground staff, who tested negative, have now been housed in the stadium. CSK and DC will get their first access to the ground on April 7 as they look ahead to their opener on April 10.</p><p>The event SOP calls for the ground staff to be periodically tested and for them to prepare the ground and wickets outside of the team training sessions as a risk mitigation strategy. The same rules are laid down for vendors, which includes the LED operators of stadium branding and boundary rope, coordinators and match entertainment crew.</p><p>This year, the onus is on the six staging associations to work together with IPL operations machinery, as no franchise has been allotted a home venue. The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA), which will be hosting the opener in Chennai on April 9, has taken some pro-active steps. “We have about 70 staff members, including ground staff and we have got all of them vaccinated 15 days ago with the necessary permissions from the corporation,” RS Ramaswamy, secretary, TNCA said. “The staff has been trained to maintain distance from teams. All our members have also been told not to visit the ground anymore, now that the teams have started to practice at the venue. With the experience of having staged the England Tests, we are putting our best foot forward.”</p><p>BCCI has also appointed four “bubble integrity managers” for each team. They are already with the teams and will accompany them throughout the tournament. “The managers look after every aspect—for example, we often get requests from families of local players saying that they just want to drop off some home food…the managers are making sure that these things don’t happen,” said a team official from inside the bubble.</p><p>The other aid to identify breaches, which was used during last IPL are GPS trackers—these were issued to everyone in the bubble in the UAE with a unique tracking number and supervised through a central database. The trackers are yet to arrive, said a team official.</p><p>Each team, along with their management and support staff, has been put up in a section of a hotel that has been sealed off for them. The hotel staff attending to the teams have also gone through testing and isolation, following the same protocols, and are not allowed to go outside the bubble. “One suite inside our section has been turned into a small gym,” said a team official. “We have a dedicated elevator, staircase and entrance in the hotel.” The bubble protocol also demands that team owners also need to quarantine for 7 days if they want to be a part of the team bubble.</p><p>The broadcasters who pump in <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>3270 crores in each IPL are also operating from eight separate bio bubbles—two in Mumbai and six other moving bubbles at the respective venues. “We are producing 9 concurrent feeds, including the world feed with 700 crew members and more than 100 commentators and presenters from 13 different nationalities,” said Sanjog Gupta, Sports head, Star and Disney India. “Leveraging from our learnings from last time, we have heightened Covid safety protocols both in terms of testing as well as contact tracing and zoning.

From West Indies’ Andre Russell and Sunil Narine and New Zealand’s Tim Seifert to Australia’s Ben Cutting and England’s Eoin Morgan, the side boasts of multiple match-winners who are capable of bailing the team out of trouble and up the ante as and when required. They also have Indian power hitters in Rahul Tripathi, Nitish Rana, and Dinesh Karthik.</p><p><strong>Captain fantastic</strong>: Eoin Morgan is arguably one of the best white-ball captains currently in world cricket and England’s world ranking of 1 in T20Is bears testament. Under Morgan, the side also bagged their maiden 50-over World Cup in 2019. Moreover, Morgan became only the fourth player--first Englishman-- to play 100 T20Is when he featured in the 3rd T20I against India in the recently-concluded series. He was handed the captaincy in the middle of the season last year but with time on his side this year, he’s expected to produce better results.</p><p><strong>Trans-Tasman duo of Ferguson and Cummins</strong>: A lot will depend on the shoulder of the Trans-Tasman pace duo of Lockie Ferguson and Pat Cummins. While Aussie Cummins--who picked up 12 wickets in 14 matches last--will spearhead the attack, he will have a very able company in Ferguson. The Kiwi didn’t get to play all the games in UAE in 2020 but impressed one and all whenever he got the chance. In five matches, he picked up six wickets including a handy 3-wicket haul. It will be interesting to see how the team goes about playing them over the course of the season.</p><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p><p><strong>Forcing Narine into the mix</strong>: Narine took up the pinch-hitting role a few seasons back and has been made to open the batting since. The southpaw gets the license to play freely and score briskly. However, that hasn’t been going too well for the side as Narine consumed many deliveries without scoring efficiently. His slow start has often resulted in increased pressure on the middle order. Moreover, since correcting his action, Narine just hasn’t been the same bowler. The element of surprise from his action has vanished and he has become very predictable. KKR need to be pragmatic this year and understand that if there is no place for Narine, they shouldn’t try to forcefully fit him in.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/aakash-chopra-picks-his-ideal-royal-challengers-bangalore-xi-for-ipl-2021-leaves-out-2-prominent-australians-101617680284312.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Chopra picks ideal RCB XI for IPL 2021, leaves out 2 prominent Australians</strong></a></p><p><strong>Opening woes</strong>: Due to Narine’s repeated failure at the top, first Dinesh Karthik and then Eoin Morgan were forced to try out different opening pairs. Only Shubman Gill remained a constant throughout. The youngster was paired with Tom Banton, Rahul Tripathi, and Nitish Rana. Before the start of the season, Englishman Banton seemed like a no-brainer but KKR were only able to give him two games. It’s imperative for them to stick to one pair, which will then lead to security and stability in the middle order.</p><p><strong>Fragile middle order</strong>: Talking about middle order, KKR just didn’t get it right last year. Over the course of 14 games, the side tried out a whopping 12 combinations for the top 5. 12 times in 14 games. That is quite remarkable considering how balanced they looked at the start. Karthik, at times, played at number 4 or at number 6. Russell and Morgan’s positions were also shuffled multiple times. Rahul Tripathi, who was a clear misfit at 6, was suddenly made to open. Such fragility was never going to bring stability. KKR must get their combination right this time to have a genuine shot at the title.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><p><strong>Shakib is back</strong>: Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan is back to IPL as he was roped in by KKR for Rs. 3.2 crore in the IPL Auction in February. The two-time champion, who was handed a one-year ban by ICC, was an ideal purchase for KKR as they needed a hard-hitting all-rounder with credible bowling abilities. Shakib is definitely more than credible as he is a former world number 1 all-rounder. The southpaw was formerly with the Sunrisers Hyderabad and has played 63 matches in the IPL, scoring 746 runs and picking 59 wickets. This is an ideal opportunity for him to redeem himself and lead the charge to their third title.</p><p><strong>Can Varun Chakravarthy force the issue</strong>: Due to outstanding figures of 17 wickets in 13 matches during his first full-fledged IPL season in UAE, the Tamil Nadu leg spinner Varun Chakravarthy became an essential part of the team. He has several variations up his sleeve and was picked up by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2020 to beef up their spin bowling department and he delivered. This earned him his maiden India call-up for the Australian Tour but he missed out due to an injury. Earlier this month, he was picked for the T20I series against England but he didn’t make the cut eventually as he failed to clear the fitness test multiple times. This decision sparked a raging debate on social media, with former cricketers and pundits criticizing the management for being too strict.</p><p>If Varun can produce an equally good season, if not better, and work on his fitness, he could turn heads and force the selectors to rethink their decision.</p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p><strong>Could waste a player in Karun Nair</strong>: The franchisee bought former Punjab Kings batsman Karun Nair after he went unsold in the first round of auctions. Nair had a torrid season in UAE, scoring just 16 runs in 4 matches. He eventually lost his place. He has a triple century to his name in Tests but hasn’t been able to cement his place in the league. Moreover, it will be difficult for him to find a place in the middle order more often than not. This means KKR risk not utilizing him enough and hence, wasting talent in the Karnataka batsman.</p><p><strong>Subdued spin attack</strong>: Veteran spinner Harbhajan Singh was added to the squad for <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2 crore by the club. The four-time champion joins an impressive line-up consisting Varun Chakravarthy, Shakib Al Hasan, Kuldeep Yadav, and Sunil Narine. However, the problem lies in the match-time of these players. Harbhajan, formerly with CSK, missed the whole 2020 season, while Kuldeep Yadav only played 5 matches, bagging a solitary wicket. Narine claimed only 5 wickets in 10 matches as he was far away from his best. Shakib Al Hasan is returning after a long gap and Varun is going through off-field issues. Morgan will have a challenging time in uplifting this problem-laden spin attack and it has to start with getting the combination right.</p>","<p>Days before the opening match of IPL 2021, former India wicketkeeper-batsman Parthiv Patel talked about the ‘biggest record’ he would like to see in this Indian Premier League, which begins from April 9.</p><p>Parthiv said he wants to see Mumbai Indians become the first team to win a hat-trick of IPL titles this year.

Sam Curran, who played his inaugural season for CSL last year, is expected to be their MVP, especially given the kind of form he is coming off. He can give Dwayne Bravo a run for his money in the line-up. Then there is Ruturaj Gaekwad, who turned out for CSK in just six matches last year, but promises to be in line for a lot more in the coming 14 games. The likes of Shardul Thakur and Mitchell Santner are coming off good match practices. Ravindra Jadeja will return from his injury with a point to prove.

Remember, Suresh Raina has just played a handful of T20 matches in the lead-up to the tournament and Ambati Rayudu didn't make much noise in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy either. There's no doubting Bravo's utility as a player, but at the age of 37 and with a history of injuries, it remains to be seen that how much value he can add. New recruit Robin Uthappa has expressed his desire to score 1000 runs this year, but his last two seasons have yielded 282 and 196 runs respectively.

Last year, CSK were simply not able to take off and by the time they realised who the right players were, the ship had already sailed. Above anything else, IPL 2021 is an opportunity for Dhoni to reclaim the moniker of one of the best batsmen. Let's face it, last season Dhoni endured a personal low, scoring just 200 runs without a single fifty. As it is for Raina. Can the dynamic CSK duo deliver one final hit?</p><p><strong>Threats</strong></p><p>One of CSK's biggest strengths, their ability to finish off close matches, was on the wane last season. For years, CSK have comprised of power-packed batsmen, or bowlers who would, more often than not, get the team over the line. But last year, the same proven performers could not take what the youngsters from other teams had to offer.

'Captain cool' Dhoni, like bowlers have said, is not only clever with his field placement but his suggestions to his bowlers tend to work out more often than not. Add T Natarajan to the list. </p><p>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) pacer Natarajan, ahead of the new Indian Premier League (IPL 2021) season, has revealed how Chennai Super Kings skipper (CSK) Dhoni's advice during IPL 2020 in the UAE helped him hone his skills. </p><p>Natarajan, who is now known as a yorker specialist, said the former India captain's advice to bowl slower bouncers and cutters made him a better bowler. The Salem-born cricketer bowlerd a whopping 71 yorkers last season, most among pacers, and claimed the prized wickets of Dhoni and de Villiers. </p><p>""Speaking to somebody like Dhoni itself is a big thing. He spoke to me about fitness and encouraged me, saying that I will keep getting better with experience. He said, use slow bouncers, cutters, and variations like that. It has been useful for me,"" Natarajan was quoted as saying by 'ESPNcricinfo'.</p><p>Recalling Dhoni's wicket, he said, ""I pitched one in the slot and he hit me for a big six - 102 metres or something.

Sunrisers Hyderabad will kick off their tournament against Kolkata Knight Riders on April 11.</p>","<p>Among other unprecedented events, the previous edition of the IPL in late 2020 will be remembered for the show put on by the fast bowlers. With pace and carry on offer at two out of the three venues in the UAE, namely the Dubai International Cricket Stadium and the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the very fast men hogged the limelight.</p><p>The IPL record for the fastest ball was smashed (by a 156.2kph ball by Delhi Capitals’s Anrich Nortje), leaving many wondering if the fastest ever ball across cricket would be witnessed as well. It wasn’t, but everyone was left marvelling at the skills of these speedsters. They turned IPL 13 into a spectacle of fast bowling, with stumps flying off searing yorkers and batsmen constantly being tested with rising balls. All that became a common sight.</p><p>Five of the top seven wicket-takers were fast bowlers. DC’s Kagiso Rabada topped the list, followed by Mumbai Indians’s lethal pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Such pairings were all around – Rabada and Nortje in Delhi, Lockie Ferguson and Pat Cummins bowling in tandem for Kolkata Knight Riders. Some teams had lone wolves, but Rajasthan Royals’s Jofra Archer and Kings XI Punjab’s Mohammed Shami enjoyed themselves just as much.</p><p>But now, as the IPL returns home, it remains to be seen whether the fast men can light up a tournament on Indian wickets. It could well happen, but for that a good wicket remains key.</p><p>In the UAE, all three grounds were neutral venues. The groundsmen’s focus, hence, was to roll out good surfaces without favouring any side. The scenario remains the same in the upcoming IPL. No team is based at home despite the league matches being staged in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata (the venue for the play-offs is Ahmedabad). So, as one senior curator put it, they won’t have to deal with any “khichar-pichar"" of the captains and coaches.</p><p>“For the success of the IPL, good grounds and pitches are very important,” says Daljit Singh, former head of BCCI’s pitch and grounds committee, who had overseen the IPL grounds from the inaugural season all the way until his retirement in 2019.</p><p>What regularly tends to happen with home teams is this: if the franchise wins a match on a particular wicket, they end up sticking to the same wicket for the next game, despite the compact schedule with back-to-back matches. But now, Daljit says that “curators will have a free hand to rotate the pitches and play on fresh wickets.”</p><p>“If they take the services of the BCCI pitch curators, then we have taught them to keep grass on it,” says Daljit. “But it shouldn’t be green. That doesn’t suit T20s. The grass layer should be 4mm to 5mm, and it should be brown and dry. Then the ball comes rapidly on to the bat, which helps in stroke-making. Bottom-up rolling will give good bounce for a wicket, where you play cuts and pulls.”</p><p>According to Daljit, Wankhede Stadium and Eden Gardens are the grounds where the fast bowlers can make a big impact in the upcoming season. “I think in Mumbai we will see good pitches. Kolkata too. Chennai will not have bouncy pitches from what we have seen but you can surely roll out batting pitches, where 180-plus scores can be made.”</p><p>The Wankhede turf is known to provide good bounce. “Ball niklega mast (it will nip off the wicket nicely),” says a senior groundsman at Wankhede. “Every year due to wear and tear and a lot of rolling, the pitches used to be tired by the time IPL started. Though there have been local matches and Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy games played here, pitches will be relatively fresh. We will keep grass this time, which after rolling will get yellow. The idea is to prepare a good wicket and have a good game.”</p><p>Another reason why the fast bowlers were able to go flat out in the UAE was because there was no fear of top edges flying into the stands, as the boundaries were big enough in two of the three venues – Dubai and Abu Dhabi. On Indian grounds, clearing the ropes is far easier. Delhi and Chennai will, in all probability, roll out batting wickets. And the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore has short boundaries, where bowlers have always struggled to defend totals.</p><p>However, the spinners and swing bowlers will not complain about the conditions in India. Reduced to playing a supporting role in the UAE, the slower ones will look to take back the centre stage. Take Chennai Super Kings’ Imran Tahir, for example. The leg-spinner was the highest wicket-taker in 2019 with 26 wickets. But in the last edition he got to play just three games and took only one wicket. The South African will now return as the leader of CSK’s attack once again.</p><p>Tahir’s case is quite like Deepak Chahar’s, who relies on swinging the new ball. In the UAE where it was more about raw pace, he had a limited role to play, finishing with 12 wickets in 14 games. In the 2019 edition, he had 22 wickets, the third highest in the tournament. Also look out for the slower pacers who have complete mastery over their variations -- slower balls, good yorkers and plenty of pace changes – such as Dwayne Bravo, Sandeep Sharma and Siddarth Kaul.</p><p>But Mike Hesson, head of cricket at Royal Challengers Bangalore, believes that adaptability will be the real key to success. In his pre-season presser, Hesson said: “We might want to change the style of play at a particular venue. There might be certain grounds where we might need bowlers to bowl more cutters, some venues where we might need them to bowl bouncers. At venues where the ball will turn, we need left-handers to bat in the middle. There are several different factors, and I am pleased with the balance of the squad. We have got a squad of 22, and each of them could step up and be counted in certain conditions.""</p>","<p>Health, especially mental health, is a topic that has finally found its due space in sports.

It has occurred together with low levels of blood platelets after vaccination.</p><p>“These clotting disorders are very rare side effects of the vaccine,” said Sabine Strauss, the head of the EMA’s safety committee. The group hasn’t identified a “definite cause” or a patient profile that would be most at risk, according to Strauss.</p><p>The EMA’s safety committee based its latest analysis on a review of 84 cases of clotting, with most to the brain area, that had been reported by March 22 -- by which point 25 million people in the U.K. and Europe had received the Astra shot.</p><p>By April 4, the reported clotting instances had increased to 222 -- again, with most to the brain area -- out of 34 million people who’d received the shot.

Lavrov also met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan, who raised the Kashmir issue during their talks. </p><p>Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi personally received Lavrov – the first senior Russian leader to travel to Pakistan in almost a decade – at the airport on his arrival on Tuesday, signalling the importance attached to the visit by Islamabad. </p><p>“We’ve confirmed that we stand ready to strengthen the anti-terrorist potential of Pakistan, including by supplying Pakistan with special military equipment. This serves the interests of all states of the region,” Lavrov said during a joint news conference with Qureshi after their meeting on Wednesday. </p><p>“We also agreed that we need to further conduct exercises and drills in the mountains called Druzhba (friendship) and maritime exercises called the Arabian Monsoon,” he added. </p><p>The Druzbha exercise between the Pakistani and Russian militaries, which began in 2016, usually features special forces from both sides. A Russian Army contingent visited Pakistan last November for the latest edition of the drill. </p><p>Russia had angered India by supplying a limited number of Mi-35M helicopter gunships to Pakistan in 2018. Lavrov’s comments about potential supplies of special military equipment, even to bolster Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities, are unlikely to go down well in New Delhi, which perceives such arms deals as a provocation. </p><p>Without directly referring to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, Lavrov took a swipe at US-backed strategies that he said were affecting stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Lavrov has been critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, which is the focus of the Quad. </p><p>Noting that he and Qureshi had discussed the situation in the Asia-Pacific, Lavrov said: “Here we see uncertain processes that happen because the US promotes divisive strategies that change everything and the stability in the region. We are categorically against new division lines. Instead we promote the preservation of those structures that have been here, including the key role of Asean.” </p><p>There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Lavrov’s comments. </p><p>Enhanced defence and security cooperation also figured in Lavrov’s meeting with Pakistan Army chief Gen Bajwa. According to a readout from the Pakistani military’s media arm, Bajwa said that “Pakistan values its relations with Russia and reciprocates the desire for enhanced bilateral military cooperation”. </p><p>Bajwa welcomed all initiatives to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. “We have no hostile designs towards any country and will keep on working towards a cooperative regional framework based on sovereign equality and mutual progress,” he said. </p><p>Both Qureshi and Prime Minister Khan raised the Kashmir issue in their discussions with Lavrov. Qureshi said at the joint news conference that he had told Lavrov about the “fragility of the situation on our border with India” and concerns about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and human rights issues. </p><p>However, Qureshi also acknowledged that tensions with India had reduced after the Indian and Pakistan armies recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. </p><p>During his meeting with Lavrov, Khan underlined the importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Russia as a “key foreign policy priority”, and expressed satisfaction at “steady growth in bilateral ties, including deepening cooperation in trade, energy, security and defence”, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. </p><p>“With reference to the situation in [Jammu and Kashmir], the Prime Minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on issues of peace and security in South Asia, including the need for peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” the statement said. </p><p>Lavrov said at the joint news conference that he and Qureshi had touched upon the fact that India and Pakistan have started talks on the normalisation of relations. “We welcome that,” he said. </p><p>The reception given to Lavrov in Islamabad was in contrast to his brief visit to New Delhi, where he only held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Lavrov didn’t meet the Indian prime minister - usually a part of any senior Russian leader’s visit to New Delhi. </p>","<p>The EU’s drug regulator on Wednesday said that the reported cases of blood clotting should be listed as a possible side effect of AstraZeneca's vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). ""One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin,"" the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.</p><p>The findings come at a time when countries around the world are trying to intensify their vaccination drive amid a fresh wave of infections. However, the health agency reiterated that the benefits of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in preventing the disease outweigh the overall risk. It also didn't place any age restrictions on administering the vaccine in the younger population, as some countries have done.</p><p>“The risk of mortality from Covid is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects,” Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director, told a press briefing.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-risk-benefit-still-largely-positive-who-101617725193448.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine risk-benefit 'still largely positive': WHO</strong></a></p><p>Several European countries have temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine amid concerns over the reports of blood clotting in vaccinated individuals.

It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington; senior Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in talks in Alaska last month.</p><p>A military move against Taiwan, however, would be a test of U.S. support for the island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. For the Biden administration, it could present the choice of abandoning a friendly, democratic entity or risking what could become an all-out war over a cause that is not on the radar of most Americans. The United States has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack.</p><p>This accumulation of concerns meshes with the administration’s view that China is a frontline challenge for the United States and that more must be done soon — militarily, diplomatically and by other means — to deter Beijing as it seeks to supplant the United States as the predominant power in Asia. Some American military leaders see Taiwan as potentially the most immediate flashpoint.</p><p>“We have indications that the risks are actually going up,"" Adm. Philip Davidson, the most senior U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate panel last month, referring to a Chinese military move on Taiwan.</p><p>“The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” Davidson said.</p><p>Days later, Davidson's expected successor, Adm. John Aquilino, declined to back up the six-year timeframe but told senators at his confirmation hearing: ""My opinion is, this problem is much closer to us than most think.”</p><p>Biden administration officials have spoken less pointedly but stress the intention to deepen ties with Taiwan, eliciting warnings from Beijing against outsider interference in what it considers a domestic matter.</p><p>On Wednesday, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the military threat against his country is increasing, and while he said it was not yet “particularly alarming,” the Chinese military in the last couple of years has been conducting what he called “real combat-type” exercises closer to the island.</p><p>“We are willing to defend ourselves, that’s without any question,” Wu told reporters. “We will fight a war if we need to fight a war, and if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day, then we will defend ourselves to the very last day.“</p><p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calls China the “pacing threat” for the United States, and the military services are adjusting accordingly. The Marine Corps, for example, is reshaping itself with China and Russia in mind after two decades of ground-focused combat against extremists in the Middle East.</p><p>Hardly an aspect of China's military modernization has failed to rile the U.S. military. Adm. Charles Richard, who as head of U.S. Strategic Command is responsible for U.S. nuclear forces, wrote in a recent essay that China is on track to be a “strategic peer” of the United States. He said China's nuclear weapons stockpile is expected to double “if not triple or quadruple"" in the next 10 years, although that goes beyond the Pentagon's official view that the stockpile will “at least double” in that period.</p><p>Taiwan, however, is seen as the most pressing problem.</p><p>U.S. officials have noted People’s Liberation Army actions that seem designed to rattle Taiwan. For example, Chinese aerial incursions, including flying around the island, are a near-daily occurrence, serving to advertise the threat, wear down Taiwanese pilots and aircraft and learn more about Taiwan’s capabilities.</p><p>Chinese officials have scoffed at Davidson's Taiwan comments. A Ministry of Defense spokesman, Col. Ren Guoqiang, urged Washington to “abandon zero-peace thinking” and do more to build mutual trust and stability. He said that “attempts by outside forces to use Taiwan to seek to restrain China, or the use by Taiwan independence forces to use military means to achieve independence, are all dead ends.”</p><p>The implications of a Chinese military move against Taiwan and its 23 million people are so profound and potentially grave that Beijing and Washington have long managed a fragile middle ground — Taiwanese political autonomy that precludes control by Beijing but stops short of formal independence.</p><p>Predictions of when China might decide to try to compel Taiwan to reunite with the mainland have long varied, and there is no uniform view in the United States. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said last week he doubts Chinese leaders are ready to force the issue.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s coming soon,” he said.</p><p>The Trump administration made a series of moves to demonstrate a stronger commitment to Taiwan, including sending a Cabinet member to Taipei last year, making him the highest-level U.S. official to visit the island since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China. The Biden administration says it wants to cooperate with China where possible but has voiced its objections to a wide range of Chinese actions.</p><p>Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the Pacific island nation of Palau, John Hennessey-Niland, became the first serving U.S. ambassador to visit Taiwan since Washington cut ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.</p><p>China is a frequent target of criticism in Congress. Concerns about countering its growing military might are reflected in passage of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, funded at $2.2 billion for 2021. Davidson wants it to support, among other initiatives, establishing a better air defense system to protect the U.S. territory of Guam from Chinese missiles and preserving U.S. military dominance in the region.</p><p>Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is skeptical of the military's fixation on dominance.</p><p>“Given the way the world works now, having one country be dominant is just hopelessly unrealistic,” he said in a recent online forum sponsored by Meridian, a nonpartisan diplomacy center. He said the U.S. military can maintain sufficient strength, in partnership with allies, to send the message: “China, don't invade Taiwan because the price you're going to pay for that isn't worth it.”</p>","<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was taken aback to find her fellow top EU official taking the only chair available next to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan when the duo visited Ankara, and her spokesman made that clear on Wednesday.</p><p>Footage from their meeting on Tuesday showed the first female head of the EU executive, the only woman in the talks, gesturing in disbelief and uttering a surprised sigh as Erdogan and European Council President Charles Michel took the two centre-stage seats prepared, relegating her to an adjacent sofa.</p><p>""The president of the Commission was clearly surprised,"" said the EU executive arm's spokesman, Eric Mamer.</p><p>""The president (von der Leyen) should have been seated in exactly the same manner as the president of the European Council and the Turkish president.""</p><p>The Turkish government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>However, a member of the European parliament, Sophie in 't Veld, asked why Michel had not reacted.</p><p>While the Commission conveyed von der Leyen's irritation, an EU official who declined to be named said that to do so might have provoked a ""protocol and political incident, both towards Turkey and the European Council"".</p><p>""Turkey meant no disrespect,"" the official said.

He has overseen a systematic crackdown on dissent.</p><p>In China, Xi, who came to power in 2012, has imposed even tighter controls on the already repressive political scene, emerging as one of his nation's most powerful leaders in the seven decades of Communist Party rule that began with Mao Zedong's often-brutal regime.</p><p>Under Xi, the government has rounded up, imprisoned or silenced intellectuals, legal activists and other voices, cracked down on Hong Kong's opposition and used security forces to suppress calls for minority rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia.</p><p>Xi has sidelined rivals, locked up critics and tightened the party's control over information. An ongoing crackdown against corruption has won popular support while also keeping potential competitors in line.</p><p>His steady consolidation of power led to the removal of term limits on the Chinese presidency in 2018, demolishing a convention the party had established to prevent a repeat of the abuse produced by Mao's one-person rule.</p><p>Xi further telegraphed his intention to remain in power by breaking from tradition and not indicating a preferred successor.</p><p>One who appeared eager to take on the role, Sun Zhengcai, was brought down in 2017 and sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges.</p><p>And in Russia, Putin's most outspoken critic, Alexei Navalny, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — an accusation Russian authorities have denied. In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2½ years in prison.</p><p>In defying the West, Putin and Xi both have tapped nationalist feelings. Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea propelled Putin's approval ratings to nearly 90 per cent before they slackened amid economic woes and unpopular pensions reform.</p><p>But the impact of Putin's and Xi's enduring retention of power hardly ends at their respective nations' borders. It ripples outward into the geopolitical balance of power in countless ways.</p><p>As Moscow's relations with the West sank to post-Cold War lows amid accusations of election meddling and hacking attacks, Putin has increasingly sought to strengthen ties with China.</p><p>And while China so far has avoided a showdown with the West like Russia's, it is coming under growing pressure from Washington and its allies over Beijing's human rights record in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.</p><p>U.S. President Joe Biden has taken an increasingly tough line with both leaders, recently describing Putin as a “killer” and having his top national security aides excoriate China for a litany of issues.</p><p>Such approaches suggest that Moscow and Beijing will have incentives to build an even stronger alliance.</p><p>Like their nations, the two leaders themselves have fostered a closer relationship, too.</p><p>Putin and Xi have developed strong personal ties to bolster a “strategic partnership” between the two former Communist rivals as they vie with the West for influence.</p><p>And even though Moscow and Beijing in the past rejected the possibility of forging a military alliance, Putin said last fall that such a prospect can't be ruled out entirely.</p><p>While both Putin and Xi each appear to be firmly entrenched, numerous challenges persist. The pandemic, for one, posed a major challenge for both rulers, and they took a similarly cautious approach when it struck.</p><p>Putin responded last spring by introducing a sweeping six-week lockdown that severely hurt the already weak Russian economy. His approval rating plummeted to a historic low of 59%. Later, the government eased restrictions and steered clear from new lockdowns, helping reduce economic damage and shore up Putin's ratings.</p><p>Xi remained out of the public eye in the first uncertain weeks, possibly fearing that any misstep could have given rivals a chance to topple him. In the end, China controlled the pandemic better than many other places, enhancing Xi's position as leader.</p><p>Xi must also figure out how to satisfy ambitious young politicians who may see their careers being stymied by his lengthy tenure. And he has to demonstrate that his extended rule will not lead to the excesses of the Mao years, especially the disastrous and deeply traumatic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</p><p>“Xi has to manage an essential paradox. He venerates Mao and is building the same cult of personality and centrality of the party,” said Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. </p>","<p>One in three Covid-19 survivors in a study of more than 230,000 mostly American patients were diagnosed with a brain or psychiatric disorder within six months, suggesting the pandemic could lead to a wave of mental and neurological problems, scientists said on Tuesday.</p><p>Researchers who conducted the analysis said it was not clear how the virus was linked to psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and depression, but that these were the most common diagnoses among the 14 disorders they looked at.</p><p>Post-Covid cases of stroke, dementia and other neurological disorders were rarer, the researchers said, but were still significant, especially in those who had severe Covid-19.</p><p>""Although the individual risks for most disorders are small, the effect across the whole population may be substantial,"" said Paul Harrison, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford University who co-led the work.</p><p>Max Taquet, also an Oxford psychiatrist who worked with Harrison, noted that the study was not able to examine the biological or psychological mechanisms involved, but said urgent research is needed to identify these ""with a view to preventing or treating them"".</p><p>Health experts are increasingly concerned by evidence of higher risks of brain and mental health disorders among Covid-19 survivors. A previous study by the same researchers found last year that 20% of COVID-19 survivors were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within three months.</p><p>The new findings, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, analysed health records of 236,379 Covid-19 patients, mostly from the United States, and found 34% had been diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses within six months.</p><p>The disorders were significantly more common in Covid-19 patients than in comparison groups of people who recovered from flu or other respiratory infections over the same time period, the scientists said, suggesting Covid-19 had a specific impact.</p><p>Anxiety, at 17%, and mood disorders, at 14%, were the most common, and did not appear to be related to how mild or severe the patient's Covid-19 infection had been.</p><p>Among those who had been admitted to intensive care with severe Covid-19 however, 7% had a stroke within six months, and almost 2% were diagnosed with dementia.</p><p>Independent experts said the findings were worrying.</p><p>""This is a very important paper. It confirms beyond any reasonable doubt that Covid-19 affects both brain and mind in equal measure,"" said Simon Wessely, chair of psychiatry at King's College London.</p><p>""The impact Covid-19 is having on individuals' mental health can be severe,"" said Lea Milligan, chief executive of the MQ Mental Health research charity.

Gebru has said the company wanted to suppress her criticism of its products and its efforts to increase workforce diversity. Google has said it accepted her offer to resign.</p><p>Bengio had defended the pair, who co-led a team of about a dozen people researching ethical issues related to AI software. In December, Bengio wrote on Facebook that he was stunned that Gebru, whom he was managing, was removed from the company without him being consulted.</p><p>Though he did not mention the firings in his farewell note, they influenced his decision to resign, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Bengio wrote in the email, ""I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion.""</p><p>Nicolas Le Roux, a Google Brain researcher, told Reuters that Bengio had devoted himself to making the research organization more inclusive and ""created a space where everyone felt welcome.""</p><p>Google recently moved oversight of the AI ethics team from Bengio to vice president Marian Croak.

(ANI)</p>","<p>Any process to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan that excludes the Taliban runs the risk of failure, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday after talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.</p><p>“The Taliban movement is part of Afghan society, and decisions on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups of Afghanistan. Otherwise, it’s not going to be stable,” Lavrov told a joint press conference in response to a question on a possible power-sharing agreement with the Taliban.</p><p>The latest developments in Afghanistan figured prominently in the meeting between the two ministers, who shared their assessments on the situation in the war-torn country. Lavrov’s delegation included Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan and a key player in Moscow’s reconciliation efforts.</p><p>Lavrov said he and his Indian counterpart agreed the Russian and Indian representatives on Afghanistan will be in close contact regularly, while Jaishankar pointed out that “what happens in Afghanistan impacts [India’s] security directly”.</p><p>“This decision has to be based on the balance of political and ethnic and religious interests... Any other way that foresees the exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to agreements that could be implementable and sustainable. All of this would be fraught with the risk of the resumption of the hostilities, which is not anybody’s desire,” he added.</p><p>Jaishankar said India’s approach hinges on durable peace in Afghanistan, which would “require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country”. He added, “The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe, and a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”</p><p>Lavrov said he hoped the Biden administration would implement the agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban last year as it had “created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement between all the hostile parties”. Russia is ready to arrange further consultations under the “Moscow Format”, which includes India, China and Pakistan, to give impetus to the peace process, he said.</p><p>People familiar with developments, said on condition of anonymity, that there was a frank exchange of assessments by both sides regarding the situation in Afghanistan, especially after the US administration’s fresh push for peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Indian side highlighted its concerns about any hasty power-sharing agreement undoing the gains of the past two decades, the people said.</p><p>India has been facing calls in recent years from leaders in the US, Russia and Iran to engage with the Taliban, though the government in New Delhi is yet to take a call on the issue. </p><p>Questions were raised when Russia didn’t include India in a meeting of the “extended troika” in Moscow last month, especially after Pakistan was invited to the meet that included Taliban representatives. Lavrov headed to Pakistan from India, and his itinerary raised eyebrows in New Delhi as it is virtually unheard of for a Russian leader to travel to Islamabad from New Delhi.</p><p>Lavrov also didn’t have an interaction with the Indian prime minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people cited above sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the prime minister was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections.</p><p>There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions. </p><p>While growing political and defence cooperation between Russia and China have sparked speculation about a potential military alliance between the two countries, Lavrov ruled out such a possibility.</p><p>He said Russia-China summits had concluded that bilateral relations “are at the highest [point] in the history but these relations do not pursue a goal of establishing a military alliance”. </p><p>Lavrov added, “By the way, we’ve heard speculations about pro-military alliances not only regarding Russia-China relations but also about such alliances allegedly being promoted such as ‘Middle East NATO’ and... ‘Asian NATO’. Today, we exchanged views on this and Indian friends have the same position as us. We believe that this is counter-productive and we are interested in inclusive cooperation that is for something, and not against somebody.” </p>","<p>“Do the Hard Stuff Too” is Point #6 in Chapter 10 of Bill Gates’s new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. </p><p>Gates elaborated on that point on April 1 in a video talk hosted by the Economic Club of New York. “To get to zero [emissions], you can’t leave the hard categories alone,” the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., now a full-time philanthropist, told the online audience. (He appeared with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.) “We’ve put all the effort into the easy categories of cars and power generation,” Gates said. “In the hard categories, the work has barely, barely begun. You don’t get success unless you cover them all.”</p><p>“All” is the key point. Businesspeople are accustomed to picking the low-hanging fruit first—knocking off the projects with the lowest costs and highest payoffs before tackling the harder stuff. But that won’t work for climate change, Gates says. To overwork the fruit metaphor, the climate can’t be saved unless all the fruit is picked, including the stuff on the very highest branches. And the effort has to start now.</p><p>Example: There’s been a lot of progress on solar panels and wind turbines, which is great. Renewable energy has become what Gates calls an “easy” category. But they produce power intermittently, and there’s been far less progress on technologies for storing the energy they produce—not just for a few hours, but potentially for an entire season.</p><p>The same goes for transportation. Batteries are wonderful for passenger vehicles, but there will never be battery-powered airliners because the batteries would weigh too much and take up too much room. So for the foreseeable future, the net-zero solution for airlines and some other forms of transportation will be alternative liquid fuels that are made from carbon that was already in the atmosphere. While those don’t add to carbon in the atmosphere they are prohibitively expensive and there hasn’t been enough research on bringing down their cost, Gates writes in How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.</p><p>Other technologies that require research include zero-carbon steel and cement, meat and dairy made from plants or cells, capture of carbon from the air, safer nuclear power plants, nuclear fusion, and coolants that don’t contain fluorinated greenhouse gases, Gates writes.  </p><p>It’s tempting to focus on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But “making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero,” Gates writes. An example of that would be replacing power plants that burn coal with power plants that burn natural gas, which is cleaner but still puts out greenhouse gases. </p><p>A better strategy, Gates writes, is to focus investments on two priorities: installing as much zero-carbon generation as possible, and electrifying as many processes and products as possible in anticipation of the day when all electricity will be carbon-free.</p><p>“If we think the only thing that matters is reducing emissions by 2030, then this approach would be a failure, since it might deliver only marginal reductions within a decade,” Gates writes. “But we’d be setting ourselves up for long-term success. With every breakthrough in generating, storing, and delivering clean electricity, we would march closer and closer to zero.”</p><p>In short: Reach for the high-hanging fruit.</p><p><br></p>","<p>At a time when a resurgent coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is wreaking havoc across the world, an undercover report has shown ""clandestine"" luxury dinners in Paris where guests are seen defying Covid norms.</p><p>The report was aired by M6 channel on Friday.

During the conference, the two sides agreed to hold the in-person hearing of Rana on June 24 at 1.30 pm local Los Angeles time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rana’s attorneys in additional motion opposed his extradition to India.</p><p>“The government has not identified a single case since the founding of this country in which a person acquitted by an American jury has been extradited to a foreign country for trial on charges resting on the same conduct,” it said in its 17-page new submission on Monday.</p><p>The US Government has time till April 12 to submit its response, if any. The US Government so far has supported the extradition of Rana to India.</p><p>Rana's attorney argued that the US government's position boils down to this: the term ""offense"" in the India-US Extradition Treaty means whatever the government needs it to mean.</p><p>In Article 2, the dual criminality provision, where the government needs the term to have a broad meaning, it refers to underlying conduct. In Article 6, it means ""conduct"" when needed to achieve a plea deal with Headley, and it means ""elements"" when needed to extradite Rana.</p><p>“The Court should reject this ""heads the government wins, tails Rana loses"" approach. Applying ordinary tools of interpretation, it should hold that the term ""offense"" in Article 6 refers to the underlying conduct, and it should deny extradition,” it argued.</p><p>Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.</p><p>Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.</p><p>As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.</p><p>These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.</p><p>In his previous court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences. </p>","<p>China’s foreign minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the US to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in China's Xinjiang region ahead of a US-Japan summit next week.</p><p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart in a phone call Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.</p><p>It quoted Wang as saying that “China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China’s development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China.”</p><p>Japan, a close US ally that hosts major American naval and air force bases, shares US concerns about China's military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas.

This will ensure that those who received placebo doses initially receive the actual vaccine now, and vice-versa. All the participants, however, will continue to be ""blinded"" so they do not know if they received the experimental vaccine or the placebo, the news agency added.</p><p>A 'placebo' vaccine has no therapeutic value, but can function as a control for vaccine testing, where researchers gauge the efficacy of the actual vaccine dose by observing the ""expected"" physiological response in patients, who have no idea if they treatment they just received was active or inactive. Placebo-controlled studies are thus most commonly used in ""blinded"" clinical trials, where such information about vaccine efficacy is consensually withheld from the participants to illicit an expected response.</p><p>Even when other authorised vaccines are made available, allowing volunteers on placebo to cross over to the active vaccine offers them an incentive to continue with the trials.

They say his proposal has been loaded down with unnecessary spending projects and that raising taxes will ultimately hurt the U.S. economy.</p><p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans could support a “much more modest” approach, one that doesn’t rely on corporate tax hikes to pay for it. Biden’s plan is “something we’re not going to do,” McConnell said Monday.</p><p>To varying degrees, addressing infrastructure has bipartisan support. Americans are experiencing outages, delays and irritations on transport and power systems designed in the 1960s and earlier. Meanwhile, China's latest five-year plan calls for hundreds more airports, coal-fired power plants and other standard infrastructure projects. Xi also is calling for his country’s focus on “new infrastructure,” including investment in 5G networks and other digital infrastructure.</p><p>“Time and momentum are on our side,” Xi told a meeting of the Communist Party last year.</p><p>China spends more on infrastructure projects in other countries than the United States spends at home, said Jonathan Hillman, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That and China's long-running economic boom, fueled in part by its domestic infrastructure spending, are helping China become more influential internationally, and may give it more confidence as it makes claims over Taiwan and other contested territory or advances its interests, some argue.</p><p>Using urgent warnings of a rival’s advances to press for more infrastructure and research spending is a Cold War-tested technique. Past American presidents pointed to the Soviet Union while building up the U.S. highway system, space program and arms stockpiles.</p><p>And in the case of infrastructure, Biden's repeated warnings that China and other countries are “eating our lunch” are borne out by many crucial metrics, and by the observations of almost anyone who's traveled abroad much.</p><p>“Almost every day” in the U.S., service providers somewhere announce “the power is out, the wi-fi is out,” said Min Ye, a researcher at Boston University whose work focuses on China and the intersection of economics and security.</p><p>Pointing to her two decades living in the Boston area, Ye says she has seen no really big upgrades to tired local road networks, no bus route upgrades that would help her get into the city more easily, no rail upkeep that would make a train trip to New York to see friends more enticing.</p><p>While Ye was glad to see Boston Logan International Airport launch projects to spiff up its interior and parking, it’s been more than a quarter-century since the United States last built a new major airport, in Denver. Academic studies and economists claim the lost hours of delays in the air and on roads and rails cost billions of dollars in lost productivity.</p><p>And the federal government estimates 18 million Americans lack internet. What internet there is is expensive, compared to that of other big economies. It all led to scenes of U.S. workers and schoolchildren sitting in fast-food parking lots to do their work online this year as the pandemic shut down offices and schools.</p><p>Research done for the Group of 20 rich and developing nations estimates China’s infrastructure spending as a percentage of domestic production on track to be more than three times that of the United States.</p><p>In Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is pushing legislation intended to pour technology research and development funding into the National Science Foundation and Commerce Department, to build U.S. semiconductor production, and to strengthen domestic technology supply chains.</p><p>Schumer’s aim, he says: “Bolster American competitiveness and counter the growing economic threats we face across the globe, especially from the Chinese Communist Party.”</p><p>Ordinary Americans could start to feel the impact of China's investment in infrastructure and other support for the digital economy vs. the United States in ways big and small, said Hillman, the CSIS researcher. There could be minor annoyances, like one day finding it tough to track down a USB cable with the right metal bit that fits their laptop, because design standards could start following those of China's booming market, not the United States', Hillman said.</p><p>But “ultimately it will result in fewer jobs” in the United States, Hillman said. “That’s the thing that is going to be most immediate in day to day life.""</p><p>Ryan Hass, a former China director for the National Security Council in the Obama administration, cautions against overstating the threat that China’s rise poses to the United States. China is facing its own problems with debt, an aging population, and slowing gains in worker productivity, Hass said.</p><p>“If the United States makes progress in fixing some of its own problems, including its infrastructure deficit, it will remain highly competitive with China,” Hass said.</p>","<p>Australia on Tuesday said it had not yet received more than 3 million doses of previously promised AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses amid export curbs by the European Union, leaving a major hole in its early nationwide inoculation drive.</p><p>Authorities had pledged to administer at least 4 million first doses of the vaccine by end-March, but could only vaccinate 670,000 after the European Union blocked AstraZeneca vaccine exports to Australia in the wake of the drugmaker's failure to meet its shipment pledge to the bloc.</p><p>""We were scheduled to have received over 3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from overseas by now, which have not arrived in Australia because of the problems with shipments that we've seen happening here and in other parts of the world,"" Acting Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd told Sky News.</p><p>Australia began vaccinations much later than some other countries due to low case numbers, recording just under 29,400 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. But the AstraZeneca dose delay leaves it struggling to step up the pace of its vaccination drive.</p><p>The majority of Australia's near 26 million population will be administered the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 50 million doses set to be produced locally from the end of March. About 2.5 million doses have been locally produced so far with thousands of doses already cleared testing and distributed to the vaccination sites.</p><p>The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, tasked to help with the rollout of the nationwide inoculation programme from May, said on Tuesday that slow domestic vaccine approvals and logistics issues will now push deliveries to June.</p><p>""We have been told that the delay is linked to supply chain delays rather than the ability of the pharmacy network to participate,"" Pharmacy Guild President Trent Twomey told Reuters.</p><p>Twomey also blamed the slow rollout on a lack of co-ordination between the Australian national government and states, with the latter complaining about slower-than-expected distribution and a lack of certainty on vaccine supplies.</p><p>National authorities, however, said vaccination centres would be doubled by the end of the week, as they look to ramp up the vaccination programme that aims to provide at least one dose to every person by the end of October. </p>","<p>Iceland's spectacular, two-week old volcanic eruption entered a new phase Monday as television pictures showed a fresh fissure had opened up and begun spitting out lava.</p><p>The 200-metre (yards) long fissure is a kilometre from the first eruption, which sits in the Geldingadalur valley, said an Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) statement.</p><p>It opened up around midday local time (1200 GMT), the IMO added.</p><p>Live television footage on state broadcaster RUV showed small amounts of smoking orange magma on the ground.

""We're going to see this for a while,"" said the vulcanologist, without hazarding a guess at the duration.</p><p>The Meteorological Office said helicopters were making sure people had evacuated the site and that scientists were on their way to evaluate the crack.</p><p>The authorities have sealed off access to the volcano site as a precaution and begun evacuating sightseers, said the IMO. People have been flocking there to see the spectacle since the eruption began on March 19.</p><p>Icelandic experts, who initially thought the eruption near Mount Fagradalsfjall would be a short-lived affair, now think it could last several weeks or more. The volcano lies just 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital Reykjavik.</p><p>While Iceland has more active volcanoes than any other country in Europe, the Reykjanes peninsula has not experienced an eruption since the 13th century -- although that one lasted about 30 years, from 1210 to 1240.</p><p>At the last count by Iceland's tourism board, 36,293 people had by Sunday visited the site, where lava has been pouring from two small craters, covering almost 30 hectares (74 acres).</p><p>In 2010 an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week and cancelling more than 100,000 flights worldwide, which left some 10 million passengers stranded.</p><p>str-map/pvh/tgb</p>","<p>Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo was a star witness for the prosecution Monday at the trial of a former officer charged with killing George Floyd, repeating the criticism he levied after Floyd's death.</p><p>Arradondo, the city’s first Black chief, fired Derek Chauvin and three other officers the day after Floyd died, and soon afterward labelled it “murder.” He testified Monday that Chauvin's actions were counter to his training and to department values.</p><p>It's a familiar message. Arradondo has spent the months since Floyd's death trying to transform a police department derided by critics as brutal and resistant to change, while fighting to preserve it from a liberal City Council that wants to replace it with a public safety unit or cut the number of officers.</p><p>FROM PATROL OFFICER TO POLICE CHIEF</p><p>Arradondo, a fifth-generation Minnesotan, joined the Minneapolis Police Department as a patrol officer, eventually working his way up to precinct inspector and head of the Internal Affairs Unit, which investigates officer misconduct allegations. Along the way, he and four other Black officers successfully sued the department for discrimination in promotions, pay and discipline. His predecessor, Janee Harteau, promoted him to assistant chief in early 2017.</p><p>He took over months later, after Harteau was forced out over the fatal shooting of Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house. The Black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Damond’s death came two years after 24-year-old Jamar Clark, who was Black, was killed in a scuffle with two white police officers, setting off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged.</p><p>BECOMING POLICE CHIEF</p><p>When Arradondo was tapped to lead the Minneapolis Police Department in 2017, he faced a public newly outraged by Damond's death and still carrying deep mistrust over the killing of Clark.</p><p>Civil rights advocates say Arradondo inherited a department with a history of misconduct spanning decades.</p><p>Many hoped he could change the culture of a department that critics said too frequently used excessive force and discriminated against people of color. He spoke of restoring trust during a swearing-in ceremony that became a community celebration featuring song, dance and prayer.</p><p>Arradondo made some quick changes, including toughening department policy on use of body cameras and requiring all officers to go through training that stresses respectful interaction with the public. But he was criticized following Floyd's death. Council member Steve Fletcher said Arradondo was lenient in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made it more difficult to get rid of problem officers later.</p><p>AFTER FLOYD'S DEATH</p><p>Arradondo quickly fired the four officers at the scene of Floyd’s death.</p><p>Derek Chauvin, the white officer seen on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, was charged with second-degree murder and other counts. City records show he had 17 complaints against him, only one of which resulted in discipline. He also shot two people during his 19-year career and was never charged.</p><p>The other three officers face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder.</p><p>Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed for sweeping policy changes: Banning police chokeholds and neck restraints; requiring officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force; and preventing officers involved in using deadly force from reviewing body camera footage before completing an initial police report.</p><p>But they also faced efforts from the City Council to disband the police department altogether — a move that was eventually blocked from appearing on November ballots.</p><p>Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.</p><p>___</p><p>Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

The high court said Google did nothing wrong in copying code to develop the Android operating system now used on most smartphones.</p><p>To create Android, which was released in 2007, Google wrote millions of lines of new computer code. It also used about 11,500 lines of code copyrighted as part of Oracle's Java platform. Oracle had sued seeking billions.</p><p>But the Supreme Court sided 6-2 with Google, describing the copying as “fair use.” The outcome is what most tech companies -- both large and small -- had been rooting for. Both Microsoft and IBM were among the industry heavyweights that had filed briefs backing Google in the case. They and others warned that ruling against the Mountain View, California-based company could have profound consequences, stifling innovation and upending software development.</p><p>Oracle had won backing from the movie and recording industries as well as publishers, which favor expansive copyright protections to protect their profits from books, articles, movies, TV shows and music. The Trump administration had also backed Oracle.</p><p>In his opinion for the court's majority, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Google ""took only what was needed"" and that “Google’s copying was transformative,"" a word the court has used ""to describe a copying use that adds something new and important.”</p><p>Google had said its actions were long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. It said there is no copyright protection for the purely functional, noncreative computer code it used, something that couldn’t be written another way. But Austin, Texas-based Oracle argued Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism.""</p><p>The case has been going on for a decade. Google won the first round when a judge rejected Oracle’s copyright claim, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. A jury then sided with Google, but an appeals court again disagreed.</p><p>Breyer wrote that in reviewing the lower court's decision, the justices assumed “for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable.”</p><p>""But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,” he wrote.</p><p>At one point in the decision, Breyer used a recipe-finding robot as part of an analogy to explain how code works. At another point, he invoked a one-sentence short story to acknowledge that copying a small amount could still be significant. Breyer included both the story, originally in Spanish, and its translation: “When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.”</p><p>Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito that he believed ""Oracle’s code at issue here is copyrightable, and Google’s use of that copyrighted code was anything but fair.”</p><p>Only eight justices heard the case because it was argued in October, after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but before Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court.</p><p>In a statement, Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker, called the ruling a “victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science."" “The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” Walker wrote.</p><p>Oracle's chief legal officer, Dorian Daley, condemned the outcome. “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater. The barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower. They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can,"" she wrote in a statement.</p><p>Oracle’s dogged pursuit of a case had been widely derided by other technology companies as a gross misapplication of copyright law. They argued it threatened to make it more difficult for different computer programs to work together and could stifle innovation among startups that might not be able to pay royalties for a few strands of coding.</p><p>The founder of Privacy Lab at Yale Law School, Sean O’Brien, said both amateur and professional software developers will now “sleep a little easier without worrying that innovation and collaboration would be handcuffed by new restrictions.”</p><p>The Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a major trade group, was among the technology voices celebrating the Supreme Court’s decision. The court decision will also be welcome news to independent software developers, small startups and others who are tinkering with code, said Tiffany Li, a visiting law professor at Boston University.</p><p>“This decision probably won’t change how startups and software developers operate. It just kind of confirms how they’ve been operating already,” Li said, adding that if Oracle had won that could have harmed a lot of developers because it would have been contrary to how the community currently functions.</p><p><br></p>","<p>An influential American lawmaker has applauded the beginning of the Quad plus France naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal and said that he is dedicated to advancing the US-India defence relationship, particularly in support of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p><p>India and three other Quad member nations- the US, Australia and Japan on Monday joined France in kick-starting a three-day naval wargame in the eastern Indian Ocean in reflection of their growing maritime cooperation amid China's growing efforts to expand influence in the region.</p><p>“Great to see the US and India participating in the Quad France naval exercise beginning today in the Bay of Bengal,” Congressman Brad Sherman said in a tweet on Monday.</p><p>Sherman is the co-chair of the India Caucus in the US House of Representatives.

The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Putin was posted Monday on an official portal of legal information.</p><p>The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends.</p><p>He has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for possible successors.”</p><p>The constitutional amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages and mentioned “a belief in God” as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%.</p><p>Following the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws.</p><p>The opposition criticized the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, as well as a lack of transparency and hurdles hindering independent monitoring.</p><p>In the months since the vote, Russia has imprisoned the country's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny,</p><p>The 44-year-old Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.</p><p>In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.</p><p>His team says Navalny had lost a substantial amount of weight even before he started a hunger strike Wednesday to protest authorities’ failure to provide proper treatment for his back and leg pains.</p><p>Navalny complained about prison officials’ refusal to give him the proper medications and to allow his doctor to visit him. He also protested the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night, saying they amount to sleep deprivation.</p><p>In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of 15 people in his room at the penal colony were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He noted that he had a strong cough and a fever of 38.1 Celsius (100.6 Fahrenheit).</p><p>Later on Monday, the newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service saying Navalny was moved to the prison colony's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”</p><p>In an acerbic note, Navalny said he and other inmates studied a notice on tuberculosis prevention that underlined the importance of strengthening immunity with a balanced diet — advice that contrasted with a prison ration of “glue-like porridge and frozen potatoes.”</p>","<p>Derek Chauvin violated Minneapolis Police Department rules and its ethics code on respecting the ""sanctity of life"" during the deadly arrest of George Floyd last May, the city's police chief testified at the former officer's murder trial on Monday.</p><p>""It's not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics and our values,"" said Chief Medaria Arradondo, referring to how Chauvin, who is white, held his knee on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for more than nine minutes. A bystander's video of Floyd's dying moments sparked global protests against police brutality.</p><p>Over 3-1/2 hours of testimony, Arradondo disputed the defense's claim that Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges, was following the training he had received in his 19 years on the force.</p><p>According to law experts who track police prosecutions, it is highly unusual for a city's senior police official to testify that one of his former subordinates used excessive force. Chauvin, who along with three other officers was fired by Arradondo a day after the arrest, sat nearby in a suit, taking notes.</p><p>In opening statements last week, a prosecutor told the jury that it would hear from Arradondo, who would not ""mince words."" Last year, the chief released a statement castigating Chauvin, saying: ""This was murder — it wasn't a lack of training.""</p><p>On Monday, he appeared dressed in a blue uniform, placed his chief's hat on a ledge in front of him with its golden badge visible to the jury, and spoke with his hands clasped in front of him.</p><p>""I vehemently disagree that that was appropriate use of force for that situation on May 25,"" he said.</p><p>He said officers are trained to treat people with dignity and are sworn to uphold the ""sanctity of life."" They are trained in basic first aid and given annual refresher courses, be it in tying a tourniquet to a bleeding gunshot victim or using a naloxone inhaler to reverse an opioid overdose.</p><p>Chauvin failed to follow his training in several respects, Arradondo said. He could tell from Floyd's grimaces that Chauvin was using more than the maximum ""light-to-moderate"" pressure an officer is allowed to use on someone's neck.</p><p>The officer did not relent in using deadly force even as Floyd fell unconscious and he did not provide the mandated first aid to a dying Floyd, Arradondo said.</p><p>""It's contrary to our training to indefinitely place your knee on a prone, handcuffed individual for an indefinite period of time,"" he said, echoing testimony last week by the department's most senior homicide investigator who called Chauvin's use of force ""totally unacceptable.""</p><p>In cross-examination, Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, began with getting Arradondo to say it had been ""many years"" since he himself had made an arrest.</p><p>""I'm not trying to be dismissive,"" Nelson said. He also had Arradondo agree with him that a police officer's use of force is often ""not attractive.""</p><p>'HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO?'</p><p>Arradondo was at home on the night of Floyd's death when a deputy chief called him to say a ""critical"" situation appeared to have unfolded at the intersection outside a food store where Floyd was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.</p><p>That Floyd was taken into custody at all was unusual, Arradondo said, given it was a non-violent misdemeanor. He said he called the state agency that investigates any case where police kill someone. He then called Mayor Jacob Frey, who in 2017 appointed Arradondo as the first Black person to lead the city's police, and headed downtown to his office in City Hall.</p><p>The first video he saw, a long shot taken on a city surveillance camera across the street, did not show him much. But shortly before midnight, he got a call from someone ""in the community.""</p><p>""They said almost verbatim: 'Have you seen the video of your officer choking and killing that man at 38th and Chicago?'"" Arradondo recalled. ""Eventually, within minutes of that, I saw for the first time what is now known as the bystander video.""</p><p>He could see how long Chauvin had kept Floyd pinned facedown, and concluded it was in breach of his department's ""principles and values.""</p><p>""We are oftentimes the first face of government our community will see, and we will often meet them at their worst moments,"" Arradondo told the jury when asked by a prosecutor to describe the meaning of the badge the city's roughly 700 sworn officers wear.

They didn’t believe it would make the virus more contagious and said its rapid rise might just be coincidence.</p><p>Now, 11 months later, the D614G mutation she helped discover is ubiquitous worldwide, featured in the genomes of fast-spreading variants from the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Meanwhile, new mutations are popping up in increasingly complicated patterns, spurring a drive by top biologists to devise new ways to track a fire hose of incoming genomic data.</p><p>The goal: Quickly detect variants that can lessen the effectiveness of vaccines for a pathogen that’s unlikely to be eradicated any time soon. The SARS-CoV-2 virus could settle down and become a mere nuisance like the common cold. Or much like influenza, it could retain its ability to cause severe disease in some segments of the population, a scenario that could require regular booster shots.</p><p>“By watching it carefully, we can stay ahead of the virus and that is what everyone is scrambling to do right now,” said Korber, who is working to create new mathematical tools for spotting medically significant variants.</p><p>The flood of new genome data is so great that the Los Alamos lab had to upgrade its servers to deal with the incoming data. Meanwhile, Korber is on four Zoom calls a week with experts worldwide to devise criteria for deciding when mutations are concerning enough to merit detailed laboratory follow-up on how they may impact vaccines.</p><p>A key mystery plumbed early-on by top scientists has been what type of virus the coronavirus will prove to be. So far, it looks more similar to influenza, which shape-shifts all the time and requires annual revaccination, than it does measles, a virus so intolerant of mutation that one vaccine regimen lasts a lifetime.</p><p>“Does it mean we need to make a new vaccine every year?” said Paul Duprex, who heads the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research. ”We don’t know.”</p><p>For one thing, mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 have efficacy rates above 90%, much higher than the 60% rate for flu shots in a good year. But vaccine makers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., along with its partner BioNTech SE, aren’t taking any chances. Just in case, they’re already starting trials of booster shots aimed at B.1.351, the antibody-evading strain first spotted in South Africa.</p><p>When viruses replicate and copy their genomes, errors can erupt the long string of RNA or DNA “letters” that determine how viral proteins are developed. Many of the errors have no effect, or they can even make the virus less fit. But a tiny percentage of these changes can give the virus an advantage, making it more infectious or giving it the ability to evade the immune system.</p><p>The HIV virus is notorious for its rapid mutation rate. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 mutates at a much slower rate, partly due to a proof-reading enzyme that limits changes. But with more than 125 million infections worldwide, some errors are bound to slip through.</p><p>At the same time, the virus has found devious ways that may avoid its proof-reading mechanism, University of Pittsburgh researchers have found. Rather than making changes in individual RNA letters, it deletes groups of several letters at a time, apparently undercutting the ability of the virus’s natural spell-check systems to see the change.</p><p>74-Day Bout</p><p>Some of the first deletions were seen in an immunocompromised cancer patient treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who died after a 74-day bout with Covid-19. In that time, multiple immune-escaping deletions developed, according to the University of Pittsburgh’s Duprex, who reported on the cancer patient’s deletions in November.</p><p>“If the damn thing is gone you are not going to be able to fix it,” Duprex said.</p><p>What makes SARS-CoV-2’s future so hard to predict is that viral evolution is like a three dimensional chess game. It’s not just the individual mutations that matter, but also the order and combinations in which they occur. A single mutation may alter the virus in subtle ways that change the impact of others down the line, according to Mark Zeller, a scientist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego.</p><p>Shared Mutations</p><p>Both the B.1.351 strain common in South Africa and the P.1 strain that’s battering Brazil share several mutations in the spike protein that the virus uses to gain entry into cells. This includes the D614G mutation discovered by Korber, which makes the spike more stable, and the E484K mutation, which is thought to reduce the ability of some antibodies to bind to the spike.</p><p>Yet so far, for reasons not fully understood, it’s the B.1.351 that’s appears to have more impact on Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, at least in laboratory tests.</p><p>Overall, the track record for eliminating viruses has been poor, with smallpox being the main example. Even pockets of polio are still around in some countries, despite efforts to eliminate it. That doesn’t bode well for the current virus, according to Jesse Bloom, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who studies viral evolution.</p><p>“Vaccination is going to take the edge off this pandemic in a very substantial way,” Bloom said. “But I don’t think we are going to eradicate SARS-CoV-2.”</p><p>Bloom predicts it will take “a number of years” for the virus to acquire enough mutations to fully escape existing vaccines. Of the roughly 100,000 possible single letter mutations for the virus, fewer than 1% are likely to help the virus evade antibodies, he said.</p><p>A Hopeful Scenario</p><p>While the virus continues to evolve in the short term, one of the most hopeful scenarios is that it may run out of big moves it can make to evade antibodies that make the current vaccines work. Under this scenario, there may be a practical limit to how much the virus can mutate and remain fit to invade our cells.</p><p>The spike protein must retain a shape that allows it to efficiently latch to its human receptor, according to Shane Crotty, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.</p><p>“There is not an infinite number of possibilities,” he said. “It is like putting your foot in a shoe. It still has to be basically the right shape and size and it still has to be recognizable as a shoe.”</p><p>Still, evidence from other common cold coronaviruses indicates they can mutate to evade the immune system over time.</p><p>In a recent study, Bloom and his colleagues compared the 1984 version of a common cold coronavirus called 229E to a version of the same strain that circulated in 2016, three decades later. Fully 17% of RNA letters in a key part of the spike protein that binds the virus to cells had been swapped out due to mutations.To test what this meant for human immunity, they obtained patient blood samples from the 1980s that could neutralize the 1984 viral strain. These people likely had been exposed to the 1984 virus and developed protective antibodies against it.</p><p>Faded Protections</p><p>When the researchers tested the samples against strains of the 229E virus that appeared in the 1990s or later, the protection had faded: Only 2 of 8 blood samples were able to neutralize the 2016 strain, and those two showed vastly reduced activity against the most recent virus.</p><p>That provides some hints for how much could change in the future, given enough time. “It’s pretty clear that human coronaviruses undergo substantial antigenic evolution,” Bloom said in an interview.</p><p>However, it remains unknown whether the virus can retain its ability to cause severe disease as it mutates and more people gain immunity through infections or vaccines.</p><p>In research published in January in the journal Science, disease modelers at Emory University found that a key factor will be whether protection against severe illness lasts significantly longer than protection against mild or asymptomatic reinfections, something that’s typical of coronaviruses that cause common colds.</p><p>While the study was done before the current variants emerged, its basic conclusions hold up, according to Jennie S. Lavine, a postdoctoral researcher at Emory University.</p><p>“What we see with Covid-19 on a molecular and cellular level is not inconsistent with what we see with endemic coronaviruses,” said Lavine, who was the paper’s lead author. “Immunity wanes, but not all of it wanes fast.”</p>","<p>A Bangladesh ferry carrying around 50 passengers collided with a cargo vessel and sank on Sunday in the Shitalakhsya River south of the capital Dhaka, leaving at least 26 people dead and a few still missing, officials said.</p><p>Twenty one bodies had been recovered on Monday.

A causal link with the vaccine is not proven, but is possible and further analysis is continuing, the agency said.</p><p>A high proportion among the reported cases affected young and middle-aged women but that did not lead EMA to conclude this cohort was particularly at risk from AstraZeneca's shot.</p><p>The EMA is expected to give an update of its investigation on Wednesday.</p><p>Some countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, have suspending the use of the vaccine in younger people while the investigations continue.</p><p>Scientists are exploring several possibilities that might explain the extremely rare brain blood clots that occurred in individuals in the days and weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><p>European investigators have put forward one theory that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in some rare cases; others are trying to understand whether the cases are linked with birth control pills.</p><p>But many scientists say there is no definitive evidence and it is not clear whether or why AstraZeneca's vaccine would cause an issue not shared by other vaccines that target a similar part of the coronavirus.</p><p>In a separate interview, Armando Genazzani, a member of the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), told La Stampa daily that it was ""plausible"" that the blood clots were correlated to the AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>","<p>The truck which collided with a Taiwanese express train last week killing 50 people slid onto the tracks only around one minute before the accident happened, the government said on Tuesday, as it released dramatic footage of the impact.</p><p>The packed train carrying almost 500 passengers and crew slammed into a truck near the eastern city of Hualien on Friday, causing it to derail and the front and middle parts to crumple.

These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. </p><p>“We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks.</p><p>Lavrov, whose visit to New Delhi focussed on preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year, said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “made in India” and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.</p><p>“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said.</p><p>“Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.</p><p>Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.</p><p>According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. Though it continues to account for almost 60% of the hardware of the Indian military, Russia is also facing growing competition from the US and France.</p><p>Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said this was an issue for any country that wants to sign agreements with Russia for weapons systems. </p><p>“We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation... We also discussed the prospect of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment in India within the concept of ‘Made in India’,” Lavrov said, adding that there were no “fluctuations or changes” on the part of India.</p><p>The US has held out the possibility of slapping sanctions on India over the purchase of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.</p><p>Lavrov further said that working with India on trade and economic issues is one of the priorities of the Eurasian Economic Union, a bloc that includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. “We hope to launch talks on a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union based on mutual benefit,” he said.</p><p>The two sides also agreed on the need to “galvanise work on the renewed inter-governmental agreement on mutual security of investments” and on increasing the share of national currencies in trade, he said.</p><p>Jaishankar also briefed Lavrov on new economic initiatives, such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and the production-linked incentives programmes, to expand manufacturing in 13 sectors which have opened up new opportunities for Russian businesses. </p><p>Lavrov said the two sides also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s the Far East and the Arctic, he said.</p><p>Collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. </p><p>“For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Made in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. </p><p>The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Vladimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. </p><p>Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. </p><p>“Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said. </p><p>“The Russian military hardware is certainly something we should consider, but after the S-400 and the threat of sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), nothing is going to be smooth sailing. Being the devil’s advocate, I’m not dismissing this but it isn’t as straightforward as it would appear,” Prakash said. </p>","<p>Vaccinations of children in a study of the Covid-19 shot developed by AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford have been paused while the U.K.’s drug regulator investigates rare cases of blood clots in adults.</p><p>The vaccine researchers are awaiting the results of a review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the UK’s drug watchdog, “before further vaccinations,” the university said in an emailed statement.

Navalny's physician and the union leader Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva tried to get inside to meet with prison officials and see Navalny or talk to the prison medics about his condition, but were turned away.</p><p>Local police said they detained nine people who allegedly “breached public order.” They included Vasilyeva and a CNN crew. Vasilyeva and the journalists were soon released, while other members of the union remained in custody.</p><p>Navalny, 44, is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest domestic opponent. He was arrested in January upon returning to Moscow from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.</p><p>A court ordered Navalny in February to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation, including when he was convalescing in Germany, from a 2014 embezzlement conviction. Navalny has rejected the conviction as fabricated, and the European Сourt of Human Rights found it “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”</p><p>Authorities transferred Navalny last month from a Moscow jail to the IK-2 penal colony in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of the Russian capital. The facility in the town of Pokrov stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its especially strict inmate routines, which include standing at attention for hours.</p><p>Within weeks of being imprisoned, Navalny said he developed severe back and leg pains and was effectively deprived of sleep because a guard checks on him hourly at night. He went on a hunger strike last Wednesday, demanding access to proper medication and a visit from his doctor.</p><p>Russia's state penitentiary service has said Navalny is receiving all the medical help he needs, but Vasilyeva and others from the Alliance of Doctors had vowed to go to the prison on Tuesday if the politician wasn't allowed a visit from a qualified independent physician by Monday night.</p><p>“We're gathering there not to protest. We're gathering there to save a man who, like any one of us, has the right to life and health,” Vasilyeva said in a YouTube video Monday.</p><p>In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of the 15 people he is housed with were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He said he had a strong cough and a fever with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 F).</p><p>The newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service late Monday saying Navalny had been the prison's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”</p><p>It was unclear Tuesday whether there had been any changes to the politician's condition.</p><p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Navalny would receive the necessary medical care but no preferential treatment.</p><p>“Of course, there can be no talk about special conditions for one of the convicted persons,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. “There are certain rules for inmates who get sick. If the illness truly takes place, any relevant treatment will be provided.”</p><p>Vasilyeva from the Alliance of Doctors said Tuesday she and her colleagues will keep coming to the colony. “I see only one option. If nothing happens, then we will come here tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will keep coming with our colleagues, requesting information and (trying to) be involved in (Navalny's) treatment somehow,” Vasilyeva said. “We can't back down.

According to a BBC report, the post-production editors of various shows are now censoring everything from T-shirts to shoes, leading to delay in some broadcasts.</p><p>Last month, China launched a PR war on Western brands, including H&amp;M, Nike and Adidas, that were critical of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region. The controversy kicked off after a due diligence report of H&amp;M, released in October 2020, was recently translated and circulated on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.</p><p>In the report, the Swedish clothing company had referred to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI)’s statement on cotton from Xinjiang. BCI, a non-profit group promoting sustainable cotton production, had announced the suspension of its activities, citing ""increasing risks"" of forced labour.

The assault came as Iran and world powers sat down in Vienna for the first talks about the U.S. potentially rejoining the tattered deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program, showing events outside the negotiations could derail those efforts.</p><p>The ship's long presence in the region, repeatedly criticized by Saudi Arabia, has come as the West and United Nations experts say Iran has provided arms and support to Yemen's Houthi rebels in that country's yearslong war. Iran denies arming the Houthis, though components found in the rebels' weaponry link back to Tehran.</p><p>Iran previously described the Saviz as aiding in “anti-piracy” efforts in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb strait, a crucial chokepoint in international shipping. A statement attributed to Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh described the ship as a commercial vessel.</p><p>“Fortunately, no casualties were reported ... and technical investigations are underway,"" Khatibzadeh said. ""Our country will take all necessary measures through international authorities.”</p><p>In an earlier state TV statement, an anchor cited a New York Times story, which quoted an anonymous U.S. official telling the newspaper that Israel informed America it carried out an attack Tuesday morning on the vessel. Israeli officials declined to comment about the assault when reached by The Associated Press, as did the Saviz's owner.</p><p>Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, while refusing to say if his country launched the attack, described Iran and its regional allies as a major threat.</p><p>“Israel must continue to defend itself,” Gantz told journalists. “Any place we find an operational challenge and necessity, we will continue to act.”</p><p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the Vienna talks a “success” while speaking to his Cabinet on Wednesday.</p><p>“Today, one united statement is being heard that all sides of the nuclear deal have concluded that there is no better solution than the deal,” he said.</p><p>Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, reported that a limpet mine planted on Saviz's hull caused the blast. A limpet mine is a type of naval mine that is attached to the side of a ship, usually by a diver. It later explodes, and can significantly damage a vessel. Iran did not blame anyone for the attack and said Iranian officials likely would offer more information in the coming days.</p><p>In a statement, the U.S. military’s Central Command only said it was “aware of media reporting of an incident involving the Saviz in the Red Sea.”</p><p>“We can confirm that no U.S. forces were involved in the incident,” the command said. “We have no additional information to provide.”</p><p>The Saviz, owned by the state-linked Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, came to the Red Sea in late 2016, according to ship-tracking data. In the years since, it has drifted off the Dahlak archipelago, a chain of islands off the coast of the African nation of Eritrea. It likely received supply replenishments and switched crew via passing Iranian vessels using the waterway.</p><p>Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by the AP showed men on the vessel dressed in military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. Those materials also included pictures showing a variety of antennas on the vessel that the Saudi government described as unusual for a commercial cargo ship, suggesting it conducted electronic surveillance. Other images showed the ship had mounts for .50-caliber machine guns.</p><p>The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy has called the Saviz an “Iranian mothership” in the region, similarly describing it as an intelligence-gathering base and an armory for the Guard. Policy papers from the institute don't explain how they came to that conclusion, though its analysts routinely have access to Gulf and Israeli military sources.</p><p>The Saviz had been under international sanctions until Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran receive relief from sanctions in exchange for limiting its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration later renewed American sanctions on the Saviz as part of its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the accord.</p><p>In June 2019, Saudi Arabia flew a critically ill Iranian off the Saviz after Tehran made a request through the United Nations for assistance.</p><p>Amid the wider tensions between the U.S. and Iran, a series of mysterious blasts have targeted ships in the region, including some the U.S. Navy blamed on Iran. Among the ships damaged recently was an Israeli-owned car carrier in an attack Netanyahu blamed on Iran. Another was an Iranian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea.</p><p>Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including a mysterious explosion in July that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility. Another is the November killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.</p>","<p>Taiwan has spotted Chinese drones circling the Taipei-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea and may shoot them down if they stray too close, a government minister said on Wednesday, a move that could dramatically increase tensions with Beijing.</p><p>Speaking at parliament, Lee Chung-wei, who heads the Ocean Affairs Council under whose purview the Coast Guard falls, said that they had recently spotted Chinese drones circling the Pratas, though they have not flown over the islands.</p><p>""They have never entered our restricted waters and airspace, they've just flown around them at a certain distance,"" Lee said.</p><p>While China recognises no Taiwanese claims of sovereignty, its aircraft and ships generally stay outside Taiwan's restricted zone, which extends 6 km from its coast.</p><p>Asked how the Coast Guard would react if a Chinese drone entered that restricted zone, Lee said they had rules of engagement.</p><p>""After it enters it will be handled under the rules.

Dianne Feinstein.</p><p>Parents, students and elected officials blasted the board for some of its targets — and its timing. The decision in late January came while all of San Francisco’s public classrooms were closed because of coronavirus restrictions. They still are. Mayor London Breed, among others, called it “offensive and completely unacceptable” for the board to focus on changing school names rather than getting children back into classrooms.</p><p>Some of the city’s youngest students are expected to begin returning to in-person instruction this month after more than a year of distance learning because of the pandemic. There is no timetable for middle and high school students to return.</p><p>The renaming effort also was criticized for shoddy research and historical inaccuracies.

Another was filed in March by San Francisco attorney Paul Scott, whose children attend public schools, alleging the school board’s renaming decision violated California’s open meeting law and did not involve the community.</p><p>San Francisco Superior Court Judge Ethan Schulman issued a ruling calling on the board to do what the lawsuit requests — rescind the vote and dissolve the renaming advisory committee — or show by April 16 why it shouldn’t be compelled to do so.</p><p>The resolution being considered Tuesday does not address the criticism but denounces the lawsuit, saying it “wishes to avoid the distraction and wasteful expenditure of public funds in frivolous litigation.”</p><p>In other recent controversies, the school board has been widely criticized for a plan to end merit-based admissions to San Francisco's top public high school, Lowell, and use the same lottery-based system that admits students to other high schools.</p><p>Tuesday’s meeting also will be the first since the board voted last week to remove one of its members, Alison Collins, from her role as vice president and other titles over her tweets about Asian Americans dating to 2016.</p><p>In the tweets, Collins said Asian Americans use “white supremacist” thinking to get ahead.

"<p>One would imagine ticking off the last-minute wedding tasks, preparing for the celebrations for their big day but couples planning to tie the knot this month are in a bind following the imposition of night curfew from 10pm to 5am in Delhi and 8pm to 7am in Mumbai, to stem Covid-19 in both cities.</p><p>While some have decided to postpone the date again, others are weighing alternate solutions, with day weddings being touted as one. “The moment it was announced, we received a call from the venue to move the function to the day, but it might be difficult,” says Saurabh Aswal, an IT professional who is getting married on April 25. </p><p> Another groom-to-be, Akhil Narang, a businessman, shares, “It is a state of chaos. The date is so near and the venues are saying they need to check the availability for day timings. We have already given ‘minimum guarantee’ to the venues but now with the option of day function, they’re not willing to reduce the cost. They need to understand that not all the guests will be able to attend in day time.”</p><p>It is proving to be an equal drawback for couples who decided to skip the wedding venues in the Capital due to a cap on maximum guests to 100 and 200 and opted for venues in NCR, as now commuting and returning before the curfew timings may be of a concern. For Abhishek Pateria, a research scholar, who took two months off from his work in Poland for his wedding and booked a venue in Surajkund, Haryana, changes will be tough. “There’s no chance of postponing as I have to fly back or even switching to day functions due to shubh muhurat. It will be difficult for guests who will attend the wedding all the way from Delhi or Noida,” he says. </p><p>Over the last year, wedding venues have started to observe the change in preferences of couples due to pandemic. Shivan Gupta , creative director, Amaara Farms says, “We have been receiving queries from couples for a brunch or moving towards day weddings, and also noticing the conscious efforts from our clients to keep their gathering intimate.”</p><p>Not just the couples and venues but other wedding vendors such as planners and photographers are in conflict as well about last-minute refunds, cancellations and postponement challenges. Vishal Punjabi, founder and director, The Wedding Filmer, says, “There have been a few cancellations because family members have contracted Covid-19.” However, he feels that when things like this happen, it teaches us to value what we have. “Now isn’t the time to party and a wedding doesn’t have to be a big party,” he adds.</p><p>As couples are navigating through the challenges to find an alternate solution, “They are taking suggestions to navigate the best possible ways to go ahead since so many vendors are involved. It has a lead to a lot of chaos and disturbance in the planning done so far. Due to very limited auspicious dates this year, the clients are not too convinced with the idea of even postponing the weddings,” says cinematographer Ritin Kumar, director and head storyteller, Cinelove Productions. </p><p>Another wedding photographer, Amrit Arora, founder, The Wedding Files, shares, “I do have 6-7 weddings in Delhi for April. As of now, none of our clients called it off but one of them called to inform that they are planning to shift it to day wedding now. There were 2-3 queries which were going on and we were expecting them to get close but now they put it on hold.”</p><p>For planners, the months put into planning and organising a wedding have gone down the drain. Aanchal Bagaria, co-founder, The Wedding Soul who had weddings scheduled in April with three-day affairs, says, “Now it’s all wrapped up to one single wedding to an afternoon lunch. Either couples are all together pushing dates to November, or opting for a sundowner wedding from 4-7pm. All our efforts and months of planning have gone in vain but have to face the fact.” She also states even for the month of May, weddings are uncertain as venues are not taking up bookings for large numbers. </p><p>Wedding planners, Kaveri Vij and Akshay Chopra of Designer Events Inc. feels it is a recap of the last year as Vij says, “Just when we thought things have started to normalise, this comes a shocker. We are still hoping and keeping our fingers crossed that we do survive this. Few days before any wedding are the most hectic for us and we literally burn midnight oil to complete all the tasks at hand.” </p>","<p>Delhi, on Tuesday, joined the list of states that have imposed restrictions to control the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as it implemented a night curfew from 10pm to 5am with immediate effect till April 30.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19</strong></a></p><p>The national capital is among 11 states displaying an upward trajectory of daily new Covid-19 infections, as per the data provided by the Union health ministry.

But I think wearing a mask while driving a car with all windows closed should not be made mandatory.

All restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments will have to now close by 10pm, but home delivery of food and other items will be allowed, said a senior government official.</p><p>The night curfew is the first restriction imposed by the government in the Capital, where the rate of new cases has jumped 130% in just the past week. On Tuesday, the city recorded 5,100 cases and 17 deaths, the highest since November 27. The Capital also conducted more than 100,000 tests for the first time since the pandemic hit the country last March.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Experts are divided, however, over the efficiency of night curfews in curbing infections, especially in the absence of any other curbs.</p><p>“The trend needs to be monitored, and we are keeping a close watch on it. Currently, the positivity rate has crossed the 5% mark for the entire country. However, in Delhi, we are completely alert and are being cautious,” said health minister Satyender Jain.</p><p>On Tuesday, largely on account of the increasing testing, the positivity rate — a measure of positive cases to total tests conducted — dipped below 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization recommends must not be breached if testing is adequate. The rate had risen about 5% for the first time in the city in 124 days.</p><p>The Delhi government order said the night curfew will come into effect immediately and be in force until April 30 or further orders.</p><p>It added that employees of private companies and those involved in essential services will have to get e-passes for travelling within the city during the curfew. The e-passes applications are available on www.delhi.gov.in and passes will be required for those travelling for vaccination, which was expanded to operate 24 hours a day from Monday. Anyone with a medical emergency will also be exempted.</p><p>Public transport, including Delhi Metro, shall function during the curfew hours for people exempted from the curbs.</p><p>“The situation of Covid-19 in NCT [National Capital Territory] of Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases in recent past along with high positivity rate and therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi from 10pm to 5am, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure for well being and safety of people,” acting chief secretary Satya Gopal said, on behalf of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).</p><p>Night curfews are among the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions used by governments to check the pandemic in Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.</p><p>In Maharashtra, which is contributing roughly half of all cases in India, authorities have imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.</p><p>Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said the night curfew will have a limited impact. “After 10pm, only restaurants, bars, and maybe some cinemas are open. All workplaces are closed, nobody goes to a mall after 10 o’clock...Simple measures like wearing a mask, staying at home, washing hands frequently, changing clothes soon after entering the home — these cannot be enforced all the time. And, ultimately these are the measures that help in curtailing the spread of the infection,” said Dr Khilnani.</p><p>Delhi Police said it will enforce the rules, except for the exempted categories.</p><p>“Delhi Police had earlier issued movement passes to facilitate the movement of persons engaged in essential services/commodities. Fresh movement passes will be issued on demand. Those requiring it and qualifying for it can also visit Delhi Police website to apply for it. All field functionaries will be available in their jurisdictions to enforce the DDMA order and to facilitate the exempted categories,” the police said in a statement. Officials said the police will start issuing passes in a few days to ease the application load on the state government’s website.</p><p>In case anyone is found violating the instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws.</p><p>The Delhi government order clarified that there was no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement, transportation of essential or non-essential goods. The order added no separate permission or e-passes will be required for such movement. Those arriving in the city at airports, railway stations, and interstate bus terminals will be allowed to travel on the production of valid tickets.</p><p>A senior revenue official said the enforcement will be largely based on trust, like it was during the lockdown months last year. “The police and our enforcement officers are also able to judge who is telling the truth or who is faking it. No one will be distressed because of the curfew, but at the same time the rules will be followed in letter and spirit,” said the official on condition of anonymity.</p><p>BS Vohra, president of east Delhi RWAs joint front, said the night curfew will create fear among the masses and make they stay indoors. “We support the move as it aims to discipline people and remind them that the virus is still far from gone. However, government should also launch a crackdown in markets and eating joints as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is brazenly being flouted,” he said.</p>","<p>The Capital’s air quality index (AQI) has moved from moderate to poor to very poor over the past four days, the result of raging forest fires from Uttarakhand (and to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh) and winds blowing in from the northern state that has lost around 200 acres of forest to fires in the past few days.</p><p>At 279, Delhi’s air quality was in the “poor” category overall on Tuesday, which according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s Sameer app means “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.”</p><p>“Delhi’s air quality is on the poor zone as suddenly the dispersal of pollutants has gone down and pollutant load has increased because of many reasons and forest fires is probably one of them,” said Anumita Roy Choudhary, an air quality expert with Centre for Science and Environment.</p><p>It isn’t just Delhi, several cities in the northern plains are facing the same problem. For example, Sharanpur in Uttar Pradesh recorded AQI of 331 on Tuesday and Yamunanagar in Haryana AQI of 289. And some areas in the foothills of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh witnessed haze like conditions on Tuesday.</p><p>Uttarakhand has reported close to 100 forest fires in the last 48 hours and close to 250 in the past week. The intensity of forest fires in Himachal is lower, with close to 60 forest fires reported in the last 24 hours.</p><p>Most of the forest fires are in lower hills, which have pine tree forests that shed highly immflamable needles in this season. As there is no mechanism to collect the needles, a spark can cause fire, said Himachal’s forest minister Rakesh Pathania.</p><p>What has further contributed to forest fires is the dry hot weather. In the month of March and in first week of April, there was 79% rain deficiency in Uttarakhand and 65% in Himachal Pradesh, according to the India Meteorological Department.</p><p>A CPCB official, who asked not to be named, said that till the last week of March the wind direction was taking the smoke from forest fires towards the north, thereby not contributing much to the air pollution levels in the plains.</p><p>According to an Uttarakhand pollution control board official, there has been an increase in pollution levels in even within the state because of the forest fires. “We will be able to provide the data on the increase after few days as raw data was being analysed,” the official said.</p><p>“There are some forest fires in Uttarakhand, but air quality hasn’t declined in NW India only because of that. Winds are northwesterly here. Air quality is in poor category mainly because of dust and lack of moisture. It will improve later today because a western disturbance is expected to bring rain,” said VK Soni, scientist in IMD’s air quality division.</p><p><strong><em>(With inputs from Jayashree Nandi)</em></strong></p>","<p>Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri and Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal inaugurated a 1.68-km-long flyover-cum-road overbridge at the railway crossing between Narela and Bawana in north Delhi on Tuesday.</p><p>The <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>389-crore project, constructed by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), is aimed at providing seamless connectivity between Narela and Bawana — two important residential and industrial hubs.

We have registered two separate cases against each group and investigation is underway,” said DCP Thakur.</p><p>Police have filed both cases under IPC section 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).</p><p>In the case against the volunteers, charges of sexual harassment and molestation have also been added based on the complaint, police officers privy to the development said.</p><p>Since civil defence comes under the Delhi government’s revenue department, the department has also ordered an inquiry into the incident. “We have asked the local sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to conduct an inquiry into the incident and submit a report,” said Sanjeev Khirwar, divisional commissioner.</p>","<p>The Delhi government is planning to introduce its new curriculum on a pilot basis for students up to Class 8 in its east district’s zone number two schools in July, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday.</p><p>The east district’s zone number two has over 60 schools spread across areas such as Mayur Vihar, Trilokpuri, Mandawali, Ashok Nagar, Patparganj, and IP extension, among others.</p><p>The Delhi government had in last July formed a committee — Delhi Curriculum Reform Committee — for the creation of a new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 years in line with the globally renowned best practices and educational reforms.

She was at the hospital when the police team reached there after receiving a call about the accident.</p><p>In the 6.09 minutes video footage, the couple is seen walking on Masjid Wali Road and two more men are seen there. After crossing the building on which the CCTV is installed, the couple takes a U-turn and go to the left side of the road when suddenly, a grey car moving at a slow speed in the middle of the road starts moving towards them and hit them.

The lowest number of cases are in neighbouring districts of northeast Delhi (220) and Shahdara (539), the DDMA report showed.</p><p>Also, as on April 4 evening, the report showed, of the 3,090 containment zones in the city, 749 were in south Delhi – the highest among the 11 revenue districts.</p><p>According to Delhi government’s daily bulletin, the total active cases in the capital on Tuesday stood at 17,332.

So, the antibody prevalence is likely to be higher in those areas. That is one reason why in this particular wave so far, affluent colonies are witnessing high number of cases.”</p><p>Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1, said they were helping the government in efforts to curb the spread of the infection.“In colonies with a high number of cases, resident groups are helping with organising test camps, ensuring delivery of essential goods to doorsteps of home isolated patients, making separate arrangements for garbage collection from residences of patients and conducting awareness camps to boost the vaccination drive.”</p><p>Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “The government’s assessment makes sense in this regard. In the previous surge in cases recorded in last November, which was the worst so far, we have seen the virus rage through densely populated neighbourhoods, with disproportionately higher cases emerging in slums, unauthorised colonies and low-income localities. So, at this point of time, the antibody prevalence is likely to be high in such areas. That means, affluent colonies are likely to witness relatively high cases.”</p><p>More than 56% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey in late-January this year were found to have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus.</p><p>In 2020, Delhi witnessed three distinct phases of severe spikes in Covid-19 cases – in June, September and November. At its worst, the Capital recorded 8,593 new cases in a day on November 11.</p>","<p><strong>New Delhi</strong>:As Covid-19 cases are steadily increasing across the city, prompting the state government to impose night curfew starting Tuesday, prosecution data related to violation of Covid-19 guidelines shows police have caught at least 1,800-2,000 persons every day over the past few days.</p><p>Until last month, police were issuing fines to only around 130-160 persons every day for violating Covid measures, such as the use of mask and social distancing, which have been set in place to reduce the spread of the infection. With night curfew already in place to tackle the fourth wave, Delhi police officers said that they have increased enforcement across the city.</p><p>Data on police prosecution, seen by HT, shows that in February, when the positivity rate had reached a low of 0.17% (February 16) and cases had declined, only 40 persons were fined on an average each day for not wearing masks. The Covid-19 cases started increasing since mid-February and in March, at least 501 persons were fined every day. The average figure has now increased to at least 1,718 every day ( between April 1 and 6).</p><p>To be clear, the daily prosecution number is close to what it was during the third wave of the infection in October-November. Delhi was recording a daily average of 3,451 new cases in October and 6,122 in November.</p><p>Police data shows that in the past five days, cases have been registered against a wide spectrum of people, ranging from the owner of a small eatery in Gole Market to the management of a posh resto bar in Connaught Place. Apart from this, at least three persons were fined inside a city five-star hotel for not wearing masks and a night club owner in west Delhi was also fined for not adhering to the guidelines.</p><p>While the first offence only attracts a fine, police said they would register an FIR if the person continues to violate the guidelines.</p><p>“For those not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, we are registering cases under the Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Disease Act. This includes owners of shops, restaurants and the places where they were not adhering to social distancing norms. Separately, we are issuing fines of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,000 to those who are not wearing masks,” said deputy commissioner of police and Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.</p><p>The DCP said that separate teams have been formed in every police station to ensure that residents are following social distancing norms, especially in the evening when restaurants and markets see a high footfall. “The number of teams to check on Covid enforcement at each police station has also increased. Our aim is not to fine citizens but to ensure that they follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, so that the infection is under control,” he said.</p><p>During the weekend, police had registered at least 17 FIRs during a special drive on checking for violations. In west Delhi alone, especially in restaurants at Rajouri Garden, Raja Garden and Tilak Nagar, police conducted inspections and fined owners/management of 14 establishments for violating the guidelines. The enforcement, police said, would be inside the establishments as well as on the road.</p><p>With people arguing and refusing to pay <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,000 fines, police have also started taking videos of violators. “We are recording the videos as evidence in cases, where people contest and refuse to accept that they were not wearing masks or violating social distancing. We are inspecting banquet halls, restaurant, and night clubs where the footfall is very high in the evening hours,” a police officer, who did not wish to be named said.</p><p>During the first three waves of the infection, the fine was only <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>500. The fine was increased to <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,000 on November 19, last year, when government and police agencies realised that citizens were not willing to follow the mask rule during the third wave.</p><p>The Delhi government had on Friday said that the city was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection. For the last 10 days, the city has recorded 2,923 cases on an average each day. Police said the enforcement on roads will increase until the fourth wave of the infection recedes.</p>","<p>Resident Welfare Associations of the city said they will ensure that all colony gates are closed early, as well as extend all possible cooperation to the police and district administration officials to ensure that no Covid-19 protocols are violated during the night curfew, which comes into effect from Tuesday.</p><p>Several RWAs, on Tuesday, started sharing messages about the night curfew on their WhatsApp groups, along with copies of the government order, while appealing to the residents to adhere to rules, they said.</p><p>The Delhi government on Tuesday imposed a night curfew — that will be in place every day from 10pm to 5am — in order to arrest the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the city. Delhi on Tuesday added 5,100 fresh cases, at the back of 103,453 tests, returning a positivity rate of 4.93%</p><p>The night curfew will be in place at least till April 30. During the seven-hour curfew period, movement of only government officials, health care workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed, said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order.</p><p>“We will ensure that the colony and park gates are closed early and limit entry-exit points after 10pm. Food delivery service providers will be asked to call clients on reaching the colony gates so that even if they get access, they do not have to walk into buildings looking out for addresses floor by floor. Residents can step out and pick up their food orders if needed,” said Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1.</p><p>Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, which is a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city, said: “For residential areas which have proper gates, adhering to a night curfew is not that difficult. The problem is with those which do not have gates and those close to market areas. In these areas, the RWAs have to invest a lot of effort to ensure compliance.”</p><p>“In such areas, the RWAs have to work closely with the police and district administration. They help decide where temporary barricades are to be installed, which access routes should be kept open and what mechanisms should be in place for emergencies. The WhatsApp groups play an important role. In these groups, the RWAs also share with their residents, updates on Covid-19 in their area, which gives them a fair idea of the situation and helps in ensuring adherence to regulations,” said BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA front – another collective of resident groups.</p><p>Amit Agarwal of United Residents Joint Action, a collective of around 2,700 RWAs in the city, said: “RWAs in the city are always there to help the government implement regulations that are aimed at controlling Covid-19. But the government should consider consulting them before regulations, such as the night curfew, are drafted.”</p>","<p>A 50-year-old watchman was killed after a concrete and iron girder of an under-construction railway bridge fell on four trucks in west Delhi’s Dayabasti near Punjabi Bagh on Tuesday morning, police said.</p><p>Police identified the victim as Ram Bahadur, who worked as a watchman for trucks parked underneath the bridge. “He was sleeping in one of the trucks on which the beam fell. He was crushed to death,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam.</p><p>While a statement issued by the northern railway claimed the girder fell “during construction of a grade separator at Dayabasti”, police said that no construction work was going on at the site for the past one and a half years or so.</p><p>Police said Bahadur, who hailed from Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, was living in Ashoka Park near Mata Mandir in Punjabi Bagh. While a few locals reached the spot after the collapse “around 10 pm”, a police officer, who did not want to be named, said that the locals didn’t reach out to them as it was dark and they did not notice anyone trapped under the girder.</p><p>In the morning, when Bahadur did not return home, his family members went to the spot along with some locals and found him trapped in one of the damaged trucks. His nephew called the police and informed about the incident, the officer said.</p><p>In the statement, the railways said that the grade separator at Dayabasti is being constructed by one of the agencies of northern railway and the work is in progress. Around 10 pm on Monday, one of the girders launched for the viaduct of the grade separator fell down, damaging some of the unauthorised vehicles parked below it, the statement said.</p><p>“Further investigation by the police is going on to find out any casualty/trapped person below the fallen girder. Reasons for the incidence is being examined,” the statement read.</p><p>Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that two fire tenders along with the rescue teams were also sent to the spot. Apart from the local Punjabi Bagh police, teams of disaster management and CATS ambulance also reached the mishap spot. The girder was removed using a hydraulic crane, following which Bahadur’s body was taken out and shifted to a government hospital mortuary. Police said a case was registered.</p>","<p>A 31-year-old man involved in 39 criminal cases was arrested after a brief exchange of fire in Delhi's Seemapuri for allegedly robbing gold chains at gunpoint from a 35-year-old man and his mother last month, police said on Tuesday.</p><p>Accused Ahsan is a resident of east Delhi's Trilokpuri, they said, and added that efforts were being made to nab his accomplice.</p><p>CCTV footage of the March 23 chain snatching episode showed two motorcycle-borne men wearing helmets robbing the victims at gunpoint.</p><p>A case was registered and all relevant CCTV footage were scanned, the police said.</p><p>Deputy Commissioner of Police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said a trap was laid in Seemapuri based on information that Ahsan, who was wanted in several cases of robbery and snatching, would be coming to Seemapuri late Monday night.</p><p>""He was held after a brief exchange of fire, in which the accused sustained a gunshot injury in his right leg,"" the officer said.</p><p>He was shifted to the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital for treatment and later arrested, Sathiyasundaram said.</p><p>The accused was previously involved in 29 criminal cases, including attempt to murder, attack on police, snatching, robbery, burglary and under the Arms Act, the police said.</p><p>A pistol, live cartridges, empty cartridges and a stolen motorcycle was seized from him, they added. </p>","<p>The AIIMS has decided to temporarily lose down routine walk-in OPD patient registrations, including speciality clinics and all centres, with effect from April 8 to minimise the possibility of community spread of coronavirus and optimise diversion of available manpower and resources for the treatment of affected patients.</p><p>It said OPDs/speciality clinics will continue to provide requisite services only for such patients (new and follow-up) having prior appointments.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/coronavirus"" target=""_blank"">Click here for full Covid-19 coverage</a></p><p>""In view of increased need to minimise possibility of community spread of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and also to optimise diversion of available manpower and materials, resources for the care and treatment of suspected/confirmed patients of COVID-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily lose down routine walk-in OPD patient registrations, including speciality clinics in AIIMS hospital and all centres with effect from April 8,"" a communique sent to all chiefs of Centres and Heads of all clinical departments said.</p><p>Respective departments may fix the limits of daily new and follow-up patients in outpatient department (OPD) for the next four weeks, depending on available strength of residents after contributing to COVID-19 pool.</p><p>Departments in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) main hospital have also been requested to inform the same to faculty-in-charge and OPD services through e-mail, so that computer facility can be intimated for modifications, the communique added.</p><p><br></p>","<p>A Delhi court Tuesday granted bail to former TMC MP K D Singh who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case.</p><p>Special Judge Geetanjali Goel directed him to furnish a bail bond of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>5 lakh, with two sureties of like amount.</p><p>Singh was arrested in January under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p><p>Singh was a Rajya Sabha member of the Trinamool Congress, but has not been involved in the party affairs for quite some time.</p><p>The ED had carried out searches at the premises of Singh and those linked to him in September, 2019 in connection with two PMLA cases.</p><p>Singh has been the chairman of the Alchemist group and while he resigned from the post in 2012, he is stated to be the Chairman Emeritus and founder of the business group.</p><p>In June 2019, the ED had attached assets worth over <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>239 crore belonging to a firm allegedly linked to Singh. </p><p>It has been alleged that the Ponzi case in which Singh's firm is being probed is pegged around <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,900 crore. </p>","<p>Police said on Tuesday that it would strictly enforce the night curfew order issued by the Delhi government due to the spiralling coronavirus cases and would issue movement passes on demand to those eligible.</p><p>The decision to impose night curfew 10 pm to 5 am was taken after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) reviewed the Covid-19 situation and it continue till April 30.</p><p>""Delhi Police will strictly enforce it except for the exempted categories mentioned in the order.

Counted among the cities with poor parking facilities globally, Delhi continues to struggle to streamline its parking management despite a policy in place. Almost two years after the government notified the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019, it has been put on the backburner by the three municipal agencies tasked with its implementation. The Covid-19 pandemic, fund crunch, lack of resources, poor enforcement, resistance from market associations have been cited as the reasons for it.</p><p>Delhi has at least 10 million registered vehicles including 7.9 million two-wheelers and 3.3 million four-wheelers. With 67,50,00 vehicles on an average added to Delhi roads annually, the parking woes continue to grow.</p><p>As per the policy, civic agencies were to make area-specific Parking Management Area Plans (PMAPs), regulate pricing, identify spaces for overnight parking of commercial vehicles, manage on-street parking and ensure charging facilities for electric vehicles. </p><p>The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) started the implementation of the policy in Lajpat Nagar-III on a pilot basis in January 2020. It prepared a PMAP under which lanes were marked for parking and non-parking purposes. Signage was installed to indicate no parking zones, tow-away zones, one-way lanes, and roundabouts. Vehicles of residents were to be provided green stickers while those of visitors red ones.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/action-on-old-vehicles-traffic-congestion-in-delhi-s-plan-against-air-pollution-101612286706178.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Action on old vehicles, traffic congestion in Delhi’s plan against air pollution</a></b></p><p>Similar plans were made for Krishna Nagar in East Delhi and Kamla Nagar in North Delhi and implemented under the supervision of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA), which was dissolved in October 2020.</p><p>Officials cited a lack of funds and manpower due to the Covid-19 pandemic among the reasons for the non-implementation of the policy. The three pilot projects were put on hold due to the nationwide lockdown imposed because of the pandemic in March last year. A majority of the civic staff has been deployed on Covid-19 duties after lockdown norms were eased.</p><p>Prem Shankar Jha, SDMC’s deputy commissioner, remunerative cell, said even after the lockdown was lifted, the progress on the implementation of the policy remained tardy because of lack of funds and resources. “Before Covid-19, we prepared PMAPs for at least 10 residential as well as market areas such as Malviya Nagar, Greater Kailash-2, Aurobindo Place, Janakpuri, Rajouri Garden among others. PMAPs were to be implemented at these places after the Lajpat Nagar-III pilot project but before we could start work, the pandemic struck and priorities changed.”</p><p>A North Delhi Municipal Corporation official, who did not want to be named, said their priority is to pay salaries of employees and have no funds to implement the parking policy. “Due to Covid-19, the income of the corporation has drastically gone down. We are unable to pay salaries to the staff and they go on strike every now and then to demand pending salaries. We have a Kamla Nagar pedestrianisation plan ready, but we need resources and money for that. After Karol Bagh and Kamla Nagar, we had to prepare PMAPs in Kirti Nagar and Keshav Puram but that is put on hold for some time.”</p><p>Anuj Malhotra, a transport expert, said the progress of the project was good until it was being monitored by the EPCA. “There used to be review meetings at regular intervals where civic bodies and other concerned departments used to give status reports on the preparation and implementation of PMAPs. But after EPCA was dissolved in October 2020, there was hardly any monitoring of the project,” said Malhotra, who assisted the civic bodies in formulating and implementing PMAPs for Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar.</p><p>Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment, said the implementation of the policy is a very complex process and unless there is a continuous, consistent and stringent monitoring mechanism, it is very difficult to push this in the right direction. She said the city needs a strong oversight system and therefore it is needed to be put in place as a mechanism for compliance.</p><p>“The Supreme Court directive was very clear that the authorities will have to do this city-wide after the implementation of the three pilot projects in Lajpat Nagar, Kamla Nagar and Krishna Nagar. Even in pilot areas, things are now back to square one. So, the big message here is that unless you have continuous and stringent monitoring of the implementation, then even the small progress that we are making will get reversed,” Roychowdhury said. “We have no idea what happened to the progress of parking policy after EPCA was dismantled.”</p><p>Experts also blamed a lack of proper coordination among agencies involved in the project.</p><p>Roychowdhury called coordination among agencies a must for the success of any such big project. “There are several stakeholders involved in the implementation of the parking policy. So, that is why you need a strong oversight system for that coordination. A holistic approach is needed.”</p><p>Malhotra suggested a state-level technical coordination committee for the implementation of parking reforms. “Such a committee should consist of senior urban designers, traffic modelling experts. The committee’s main job should be to coordinate among agencies and to review the PMAPs and provide solutions to tackling an area. It should directly report to the urban development minister or chief minister. The committee shall also coordinate between different departments to help implement the PMAPs.”</p><p>A lack of a skilled technical workforce is seen as another reason for the lack of implementation of the policy. To address the issue, SDMC in September started training its officials, mostly engineers, on the modalities of PMAPs and how to implement them in neighbourhoods. “We have trained some staff in the three civic bodies to prepare and implement PMAPs, but we still need skilled hands,” said Jha.</p><p>Malhotra said the municipalities should also hire in-house urban planners and urban designers to create PMAPs to meet the parking requirement of neighbourhoods.</p><p>Roychowdhury said technical knowledge and skill-building is necessary to create technically sound teams to work on the creation and implementation of PMAPs with the help of professionals. She added the municipalities will have to make PMAPs in large numbers and for that, they need to develop a skilled workforce along with professional guidance.</p><p>Civic authorities re-implemented the pedestrianisation plan on Karol Bagh’s Ajmal Khan Road on April 1 despite traders’ resistance. The emergency lane of the road, which was taken over by vehicles earlier, has since been reserved for walkers and street vendors. At some points, vehicles continued to be parked on the pedestrianised stretch. </p><p>“We have reimplemented the plan as per the policy. Traders are opposing the move and we are now assessing the situation. We had invested time and money in making Karol Bagh a pedestrian-friendly market so we cannot let it become a chaotic market,” a municipal official said, requesting anonymity.</p><p>In June 2020, vehicular movement was allowed on pedestrianised stretches in Krishna Nagar, Karol Bagh, and Kamla Nagar markets on the traders’ demand.</p><p>Aman Rajput, East Delhi Municipal Corporation’s deputy commissioner, said that vehicular movement on the pedestrianised stretches under their jurisdiction continues as the traders are not supportive of the plan. “They say that their business is already down due to the pandemic and the people coming to markets prefer personal vehicles. So, they say that if the pedestrianisation plan is reimplemented, their business will suffer. We have also put on hold the PMPs for Laxmi Nagar and Geeta Colony as we cannot implement such plans without the public’s support.”</p>","<p>The Delhi government has imposed a night curfew with immediate effect in the wake of the rising Covid-19 cases in the national Capital, according to a Delhi Disaster Management Agency (DDMA) order released on Tuesday.

Delhi’s positivity rate stayed below 5% for 124 days till it crossed that threshold on Monday.</p><p>Officials said that RWAs across the city had started working in sync with various district administrations to help the government increase Covid vaccination coverage and ensuring delivery of essential goods at the doorsteps of patients in home isolation, the official added.</p><p>“The government has held hundreds of meetings with resident welfare groups across the city since the beginning of the pandemic, seeking their cooperation in Covid-19 management. Such groups have been immensely helpful in the fight against the virus on a wide range of areas – increasing tests, making home isolation and containment possible, implementing Covid-19 regulations — especially after lockdown restrictions were relaxed — and now in the vaccination drive,” said Delhi revenue minister Kailash Gahlot on Monday.</p><p>On April 1, when the vaccination drive opened for all individuals aged over 45 years, a few vaccine sites in north-east Delhi recorded unusually high turnouts.</p><p>“We witnessed a lot of people arriving from specific localities in large groups. On the first day, we first saw a bus full of beneficiaries arrive at the vaccine site. Then electric rickshaws full of beneficiaries started making rounds. When this phenomenon into the second day, we realised that the mass arrival of beneficiaries was a result of an initiative by local resident welfare groups. It helped speed up the vaccination drive,” said a medical officer in-charge of a vaccine site in north-east Delhi, who did not wish to be identified.</p><p>Since April 1, several vaccine sites across the city have witnessed a similar trend – large groups of people arriving to get their shots. Most of these beneficiaries often turn out to be neighbours from specific blocks and pockets of localities — like GTB Enclave, Keshavpuram, Model Town and Sarvapriya Vihar among others, said senior officials in the health and revenue departments of the government.</p><p>Senior government officials said that hundreds of resident welfare associations across the city have also been helping the district administrations in scaling up tests and delivering essential goods to the residence of home isolated patients. As on Sunday, Delhi had 7,144 individuals in home isolation.</p><p>“Delhi will not see a lockdown any time soon. So Covid-19 cases will fluctuate. This means that the government has to keep up its testing, tracing, isolation and vaccination efforts. And they cannot do it alone. Community involvement is vital.

It is a bit easy now, compared to the situation last year, because containment zones are much smaller. There are no barricades. One can easily drop items outside the door.”</p><p>As on April 4, Delhi had nearly 3,000 micro-containment zones.</p><p>“Now that the vaccine drive will be open for people aged over 45 years, we will intensify our campaign. We have already arranged cars, for elderly people who register themselves in advance in slots between 9am and noon. We can extend the timings in the coming days,” said Atul Kapoor, president of the south Delhi RWA Federation.</p><p>Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “Such community participation is extremely essential in the management of pandemics and disasters.

The worrisome bit is that this heat wave can cause severe dehydration, especially to those homeless who are out on the streets. Keeping this in mind, several non profit organisations across Delhi-NCR are doing their bit to ensure help is provided to the needy.

To provide for those homeless who are looking for a shelter from the scorching heat, Ravi Kalra, founder, The Earth Saviours Foundation, says, “We are in the process to accommodate 2,000 abandoned senior citizens and homeless mentally disabled people at our NGO’s new upcoming shelter home located at Mandawar Village in Gurugram. We work with the police and courts to rescue people from the roads.” </p><p>Rahul Verma, founder, Uday Foundation, says, “We believe that providing mere basic health care is not enough, as every individual also deserves dignity. So, we ensure the same by providing them respect, human touch, basic health care, free food and dry ration through an empathetic approach. Throughout the year we run our share and care campaign, where we provide help in-kind to the homeless and underprivileged patients in government hospitals, and people who are living in open on the streets and at shelters during the night. We distribute them among other necessities, packed water bottles, ORS, glucose and juices during the summer months in Delhi and other major parts of northern India with the support of our volunteers, corporate and individual donors.

These days can be extremely challenging and fresh water is not easy to find for the homeless. Some even fall sick due to dehydration. We wouldn’t want the homeless to consume drainage water and harm their health. Our aim is to stop that. Apart from that we’re also giving them hand towels for hygiene purposes,” says Sudhir Behrani, founder of the NGO.</p><p>And the Robin Hood Army is focusing not only to ensure that those on the streets don’t go empty stomach, but also get nourished with knowledge, and are therefore facilitating education for the street children. Continuing to serve meals to those who need it the most, Neel Ghose, founder of the organisation, says, “We are currently serving 1.1 million meals per month across 217 cities, and we hope to scale that significantly. With the vaccine mobilisation spreading, we hope to ramp up enabling street children being enrolled in schools through our education initiative, the Robin Hood Academy.” </p><p><b>Author tweets <a href=""https://twitter.com/NainaArora8"" title=""twitter.com"">@Nainaarora8</a></b></p><p><b>Follow more stories on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=HT%20City"" title=""www.facebook.com"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle"" title=""twitter.com"">Twitter</a></b></p>","<p>A bag containing an object that looked like a bomb was found on a pavement near the National Media Centre in central Delhi on Monday morning, prompting the security personnel from Central Industrial Security Forces (CISF) and Delhi Police to reach there with dog squad as well as bomb detection and disposal squad.</p><p>CISF officials later said it was a mock drill carried out to check the alertness of their personnel deployed in the security of the national media centre. </p><p>“We had placed a dummy bomb in a bag outside the media centre and made a call regarding it.

Then, imagine how tough it would be for the stray animals and birds, who have no recourse from the wrath of Sun god! But, there are ways to ensure that our furry and feathered friends make it through the season with ease, if only each one of us becomes a little mindful.</p><p><b>A water bowl in the house costs nothing</b></p><p>Animals get dehydrated quite easily when it’s too hot. So, water bowls are an effective solution to help them survive the harsh heat. Shruti Kapoor, a Delhiite, who has been keeping water bowls for stray dogs across the city, says, “I’ve placed water bowls at more than 100 locations in Delhi. At some places, I’ve to go and refill it everyday whereas at others, there are some kind people who help refill them. In fact, you could make a water bowl for the strays out of any kitchen utensil, but terracotta pots are the best since they keep the water cool for longer duration.”</p><p>Seema Asthana, a resident of Delhi’s RK Puram, has kept water baths for birds to drink and bathe in, since the heat became unbearable. She says, “The most important idea is to keep the bowl at an elevated spot so that the birds are safe from stray animals, who might be on the prowl. Also, refilling the bowl regularly, and cleaning it once in two days will make sure that no infections get transmitted from one sick bird to another.” </p><p><b>Some shade from the sun</b></p><p>Stray dogs are prone to get a heat stroke since they are out on the streets most of the time. To avoid the heat from taking a toll on stray dogs, Sumit Singla, a member of Paws for a Cause, an animal welfare initiative, says, “One can create makeshift dog houses using cartons, cardboard pieces and even plastic sheds that provide respite from the sun. Dogs and cats sometimes take shelter under parked vehicles, which makes it important for us to check properly before you start driving your vehicle so that you don’t end up injuring or killing them.”</p><p><b>Watermelon and cucumber in diet </b></p><p>Animals need the right nutrition to battle heat. Therefore, fruits are a good source of nutrition. “Watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber and other hydrating fruits can help restore their lost energy due to the heat,” says Singla, adding how summer can bring with it varied health issues for strays, including ticks: “Ticks and worms can overload the already loaded immune systems of animals. Regularly de-tick and deworm them, ensuring to not overdose on medication.” </p><p><b>Cooler in guard houses, could cool strays </b></p><p>Priya Chopra, a resident of Safdarjung, Delhi, is prepping to organise a drive in the city to provide water to strays including cows, and raise awareness for the cause. “I have booked a water tanker, and will go to isolated spots in the city where animals are neglected and have no access to food or water. Cows and dogs roam on the streets all day in the burning heat. I plan to speak to the residents in these areas to replenish their water bowls on a daily basis,” she says, adding, “I have asked people in my society to make sure that the stray dogs are allowed to sit in front of the cooler, which is provided in various guard rooms of the houses.” </p><p><b>Author tweets <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">@bhagat_mallika</a></b></p><p><b>Follow more stories on<a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com""> Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">Twitter</a></b></p>","<p>Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Monday said that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will soon create micro containment zones in the national capital to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).

Licensees flouting ownership rules are liable to have their licence cancelled. Records show that many private vends are controlled by a few individuals or groups, who list different operators, addresses, and excise licence names, to bypass the rules.</p><p>In several cases, however, the names of the authorised signatory needed for wholesale purchases are the same, show banking transactions.</p><p>“The extent and nature of cartelisation in retail liquor licences in Delhi has recently come to our notice and we will take strictest action possible. The new Delhi excise policy will effectively put an end to such cartelisation,” said a senior Delhi government official.</p><p>The Delhi government’s proposed new excise policy seeks to address several issues, including proxy ownership. Delhi has 849 liquor stores, of which 276 are privately run. Retail liquor licences are given through an application for a fee of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>8 lakh.</p><p>HT tracked transactions of 42 liquor stores in the city in 2020 and early 2021. Payments made by these retail stores showed that the stores were controlled by only three people.</p><p>Of these, payments for 23 vends were made by one common authorised signatory — Rohit Arora — despite each of these stores being registered under different individuals or companies.</p><p>For example, a liquor vend at Star City Mall in Mayur Vihar Phase 1 is registered under Bigway Export Private Limited, which cleared its payments through cheques with the signature of Rohit Arora, its owner.</p><p>But the same person also issued cheques for the liquor stores at D-Mall Netaji Subhash Place; RG City Centre Mall at North Delhi’s Lawrence Road; Rohini Sector 10; Karol Bagh; and Bawana, among others. All these are registered under different names and companies in the government records.</p><p>A senior excise department official admitted that the practice of proxy ownership and flouting of the one licence-one shop rule exists in Delhi.</p><p>“Some of them have their own manufacturing units in Punjab and other states. Those who own 20-30 stores arm twist the wholesalers to agree to their terms and conditions. They decide the wholesale buying price and seek huge discounts even as the retail price doesn’t decrease accordingly, thereby increasing their profit margins. They seek extra credit days, because of which wholesalers don’t get payments up to three months and engage in stock blocking as well. This is the current situation in Delhi,” said the official, requesting anonymity.</p><p>Rohit Arora declined to comment. His cousin Prashant Arora, who is a wholesale dealer of liquor, said this practice was at least two decades old. “If what liquor retailers are doing is illegal, why did the Delhi government’s excise department keep renewing all the licences? Why was no action taken?” he asked.</p><p>He admitted that Rohit Arora, whose name was on the banking transactions, was his cousin but denied that he had broken any rules by controlling multiple liquor vends. “What is being alleged as proxy ownership is the outcome of loopholes in the excise policy,” he said.</p><p>As per existing rules, it is illegal for a wholesaler of liquor to open a retail store. “No licence for retail sale of liquor for consumption off the premises and for consumption on the premises shall be granted to the holder of wholesale licence and vice versa,” states the 2010 policy</p><p>Similarly, in 12 stores, the name of businessman Nitin Verma was common in all banking transactions. In seven stores, Amit Arora, who runs the Buddy group, was mentioned in banking transactions.</p><p>Verma did not comment on the matter. Amit Arora denied the allegation and said every licensee is a different entity, a different company.</p><p>“I have no proxy ownership in any of my companies, any of my stores. The name of the companies might sound similar, but none of them have similar shareholdings. Proxy ownership is happening in those shops that have proprietorship. Here, a few individuals after a decade or so bought several licenses which were in the proprietorship model. But signatories continue to be in the first owner’s name. You have to understand the difference between proprietorship, partnership and private limited companies. Ours are proper private limited companies,” he said.</p><p>But he couldn’t explain how the same name kept recurring in several banking transactions.</p><p>A liquor industry executive said the practice was widespread and the people named above were among a larger group of individuals who used loopholes in the existing rules to expand their business network.</p><p>“For example, when you sell a store to someone else, the name on the licence remains that of the original owner. So there’s little way to check if a monopoly is being established,” said this person, who requested anonymity.</p><p>“The problem right now goes beyond just the issue of proxy ownership. It has rather evolved into cartelisation with a few retailers also getting into manufacturing cheaper variants,” alleged a second government official on condition of anonymity. “It negatively affects the customer’s experience as many of the renowned and top-selling labels remain ostensibly out of stock in the shelves of Delhi’s shops.”</p><p>Nearly 100 such shops are run by three or four individuals, said the official quoted above. The extent of proxy ownership ranges from people running five shops to as many as 30-odd, he added. “The 42 shops are just the tip of the iceberg.”</p><p>A third official said new recommendations to change the excise policy will reduce tax evasion and ensure the government does not lose out on excise duty.</p><p>“The 270-odd private liquor shops earn a gross profit of about <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>350 crore, but what the retailers actually declare is just about <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>70-80 crore. The proposed policy will put an end to this as only big players who can show their income tax returns for at least three years, have a turnover of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>250 crore and can pay the earnest money deposit of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>30 crore per zone, will be able to bid for the tender. It will ensure that white money is put in the business,” the official said.</p><p>The new recommendations divide the Capital in 32 zones and end the system of collecting licence fees separately for each store. Instead, an upfront licence fee is charged. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.</p><p>Experts said the proxy ownership was responsible for cartelisation and “brand pushing”, where consumers have to make do with inferior brands pushed by the store.</p><p>Anand Vijay Jha, senior vice president (corporate affairs) of UBL (United Breweries Limited) said the proposed Delhi excise policy has some forward looking provisions.</p><p>“We welcome the push towards more consumer choice and the harmonisation of the LDA [legal drinking age] with most of the country .The new ‘Brand Registration’ policy is another positive, however the implications on MRP and population based redistribution of existing outlets can only be determined in due course of time,” he said.</p>","<p>Citing that sales had halved since the pedestrianisation of the Karol Bagh main market road was reintroduced on April 1, traders on Monday demanded a roll back of the plan. They also approached New Delhi Lok Sabha member Meenakshi Lekhi, requesting a withdrawal of the restrictions.</p><p>“The reintroduction of the pedestrianisation plan in the Karol Bagh market at this point of time is not a good idea as it is adversely impacting our business, which has gone down by over 50% in just a couple of days after the implementation. Seeing an uptick in Covid-19 cases, people don’t want to visit markets using public transport. They prefer private vehicles and now, as traffic is banned on the main market road, the number of shoppers has gone down,” Murli Mani, the president of Ajmal Khan Road Vyapar Mandal, said.</p><p>However, officials said that there was no plan to withdraw the restrictions. “As of now, there is no plant to roll back the decision. But we are in touch with traders and assessing the situation. We will take necessary measures as and when required,” said Jai Prakash, mayor, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.</p><p>Karol Bagh was the first shopping hub in Delhi to be pedestrianised, as part of which the main market road, Ajmal Khan Road, was restricted to vehicles in May last year.</p><p>However, on demand from traders, a six-metre emergency lane on the road was opened to traffic in July. On April 1, the North Delhi Municipal Corporation reintroduced the restrictions.</p><p>On Monday, the traders also protested in the market to oppose the move.</p><p>Mani said that they wrote to area MP Lekhi demanding the withdrawal. “Our meeting with the Meenakshi Lekhi was scheduled for today (Monday), but she was not in town. We are planning to meet her tomorrow. We have submitted a letter of our demands,” Mani said.</p><p>HT visited the market on Monday and found that traffic did not ply on the main Ajmal Khan Road although vehicles were parked outside a few shops. The main road was largely occupied by hawkers selling clothes, bags, shoes and utensils. Benches were stained with spit marks and dustbins were overflowing at a few locations. Although the traffic police and civil defence volunteers placed barricades, a few two-wheelers and e-rickshaws were seen navigating their way through the crowds on the stretch.</p><p>“We are against the idea of pedestrianisation at a time when coronavirus cases are increasing. If this continues, then traders will literally be on the road as their business will be severely impacted. We have always supported the government and the civic body, but it’s their time to think about us and let vehicles ply so that the market remains alive,” said Ajay Bajaj, advisor, Karol Bagh Traders Federation.</p><p>However, shoppers said they had a better experience when there were no vehicles. “When the market road is reserved for pedestrians, the shopping experience is pleasant as we can roam freely without the fear of being hit by a vehicle. When the stretch is pedestrianised, then everything looks in order,” Utkarsha Dixit, a shopper, said.</p><p>Another shopper, Ashutosh Singh, said that most of the space that used to be covered by vehicles is clear now. “There is no clutter and no cacophony of vehicles in the market now,” Singh said.</p>","<p>With an eye on the surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, the Delhi government on Monday ordered 11 of its hospitals to add 1,540 beds and 54 private ones to add 3,317 beds for these patients. Just over 1,000 of these would be for intensive care, according to the government.</p><p>This was the second time in a week that the government moved to increase the number of beds in major private hospitals. HT reviewed occupancy rate at private hospitals to find that several had already reached close to 80%.</p><p>On March 31, 33 major hospitals had been told to add 1,080 beds for Covid patients as the city witnessed a sudden jump in the number of new Covid-19 cases, almost doubling between March 31 and April 3. These hospitals were covered once again in Monday’s order from Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of Delhi’s Nursing Home Cell.</p><p>“The positivity rate and number of active cases in Delhi was 2.71% and 8,838 respectively on March 31. The same has increased to 4.67% and 13,982, respectively by April 4,” read the order. Monday’s numbers, 3,548 fresh cases on the back of 64,003 tests, pushed the positivity rate up to 5.54%, the first time it breached 5% since December 3.</p><p>“In order to augment the bed capacity for Covid-19 patients and at the same time to also ensure that treatment of non-Covid critical patients is not compromised, 54 large private hospitals having bed strength of 100 beds or more are directed to reserve at least 30% of their ICU bed capacity or double the occupancy as on April 5, whichever is higher and 30% of their ward bed capacity or double the occupancy as on April 5, whichever is higher for Covid related treatment,” the order further read.</p><p>The order translates to an additional 4,857 beds.</p><p>“Every day we are opening up additional beds for Covid-19. Last year, all non-emergency surgeries had been halted and patients were anyway not coming to hospitals because of the Covid-19 scare. Now, non-Covid services are running at about 70 to 80% of what it did before Covid-19,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant for internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo.</p><p>Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, at Max Healthcare said, “The cases are rising exponentially. The pace at which the number of cases has gone up this time around did not give us time to ramp up capacity. The situation is heading towards what it was during November.”</p><p>During a check, HT found that the occupancy of beds was high at some big private hospitals – 82.4% at Indraprastha Apollo, 88.1% at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, and 70.6% at Max hospital-Saket.</p><p>Among the government hospital, Lok Nayak was directed to increase the number of Covid-19 beds from 300 to 1,000, with the number of ICU beds increasing from 50 to 200. Lok Nayak was the first Delhi government-run centre to be designated as a Covid-19 centre in March last year, after which all 2,000 of its beds were earmarked for only the treatment of the viral infection.</p><p>“We have received the order to increase the number of beds. We will just have to move some patients around but we have the requisite number of beds available at the moment. We have a capacity of 2,000 beds and there are only 700 non-Covid patients admitted at the moment. The medicine and casualty blocks will be reserved for Covid-19 patients,” said a senior administrator from Lok Nayak hospital.</p><p>Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where none of the beds were earmarked for the infection, has now been asked to reserve 500 Covid beds, with 100 of them being in the ICU.</p>","<p> Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday directed senior government officials to expedite talks with neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to ensure increased water supply to Delhi.</p><p>“Our aim is to increase the availability of clean drinking water to every household in Delhi.

The DCP said the police uploaded the dead man’s photograph and physical description on to the zonal integrated police network (ZIPNET)..</p><p>Twelve days later, DCP Sathiyasundaram said, a person named Lalit approached the police and identified the dead man as his brother. The autopsy was conducted and its report confirmed that Kumar died of strangulation and blunt force trauma to the head. A murder case was registered, and the investigating teams questioned Kumar’s relatives, friends, and people working at his shop.</p><p>“We finally zeroed in on Kumar’s friend Jain and interrogated him. Jain confessed to the crime and his interrogation also led to the arrest of his associate Singh,” added the DCP.</p><p>Police said Jain revealed that he had borrowed <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1 lakh from Kumar. As Kumar had taken the money on loan too, he was under pressure from private lenders to return it. To avoid the money lenders, Kumar had started living at Jain’s house from January 18, they added.</p><p>On January 22 night, an argument allegedly broke out between Jain and Kumar over the issue. Jain allegedly hit Kumar with a blunt object and then strangled him to death. Jain later allegedly called Singh and the duo shifted Kumar’s body, said the DCP.</p><p>“They threw Kumar’s bag, clothes, and an electrical equipment kit in the Yamuna from the Wazirabad area,” he said.</p>","<p>Despite the surge in Covid-19 infections in the city, citizens continue to display laxity towards appropriate and safe behaviours in public spaces, such as malls and markets. During a spot check by HT at some popular malls on Monday, many visitors were seen not wearing masks while a few among those wearing one did not do so appropriately.</p><p>At Select Citywalk mall, lack of mask discipline was the main concern, as visitors maintained sufficient distance from one another after announcements were made through a public address system.</p><p>A few shopkeepers HT spoke to said that social distancing was not a problem as the footfall was declining due to the recent surge in cases. However, they said that most visitors remove their masks while clicking pictures and failed to put them back.</p><p>Yogeshwar Sharma, chief executive officer and executive director, Select Citywalk, said that Covid-19 protocols at the mall were enforced rigorously since the lockdown ended last year. “We have always stressed on mandatory wearing of masks for all visitors, retailers, and staff at all points, as well as regular disinfection of all public spaces. We have strived to educate all visitors on our Covid-19 protocols, and will continue to do, as a part of increased vigilance,” said Sharma.</p><p>At V3S mall in Laxmi Nagar, staff members were stationed at the entry gate to carry out thermal checks and sanitise visitors. However, visitors were not following physical distancing norms and many of them did not cover their mouth and nostrils with the mask. Many were also seen sitting in clusters on the mall courtyard.</p><p>A few shopkeepers HT spoke to expressed concern over the lack of appropriate behaviour but said their businesses cannot survive another hit, as witnessed during last year’s lockdown.</p><p>Visitors at the mall, who were seen flouting the mask rules, said that they had taken them off while clicking pictures and failed to put them back on.</p><p>Despite efforts, the V3S mall administration couldn’t be reached for comment.</p><p>Police officials said that around 20 fines were issued outside the V3S mall premises every day. “People start wearing masks when they see us approaching.

Beneficiaries should come forward and get the shot. We will not let there be a shortage of facilities,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet.</p><p>Two weeks ago, all Delhi government hospitals were asked to open six vaccination sites and run them for 12 hours between 9 am and 9 pm.</p><p>“One-third of the vaccination sites in all the Delhi government hospitals will also function from 9pm to 9am,” read the latest order by S Sunil, deputy secretary of Delhi’s health and family welfare department.</p><p>On Thursday, Kejriwal, in a press briefing, ruled out the possibility of a lockdown or curbs in Delhi at this stage, even though he admitted that a “fourth wave” of the Covid-19 pandemic is raging in the Capital. He also asserted that the government will scale up its strategies on test, tracing, containment and vaccination, even as he appealed to people to take all necessary precautions.</p><p>“We must move the vaccination campaign forward in a more swift manner. This needs to be done at two levels. First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centres. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centres need to be relaxed. For example, according to the central government’s instructions, vaccination centres can only be set up in hospitals or dispensaries. Initially, this was done to ensure that if someone had an adverse reaction to the vaccine, they could be treated immediately in the hospital. The vaccination drive in the last three months has shown that the vaccine is safe. It is, therefore, requested that this condition be removed so that large-scale vaccination centers can be built in schools, community centers, and other places… The Delhi government will ensure that it takes all necessary precautions. In this instance, for example, arrangements for ambulances, etc, will be made at every centre,” said Monday’s statement, citing Kejriwal’s letter to Modi.</p><p>“It [the vaccine] should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunisation,” the statement continued.</p>","<p>The debate on extending free education up to class 12 to economically weaker section (EWS) students of private schools has risen once again with parents of several class 9 students saying they have been told to pay the school fee from this academic year.</p><p>Many parents said the demand is like a bolt from the blue and the fee of approximately over <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>7,000 a month is beyond them as they earn only about that much or less in a month.</p><p>The Right to Education (RTE) Act mandates that 25% of seats in entry-level classes (kindergarten and class 1) at private school be reserved for EWS and disadvantage groups (DG) students. It guarantees free education to such children till the completion of class 8 and the state and central governments reimburses schools a fixed amount towards this.</p><p>In the past few days, several private schools in Delhi have sent out letters to parents of class 9 students asking them to pay fee from this academic session, on a par with general category students, or leave the school.</p><p>When the first batch of EWS students completed class 8 in 2019 in Delhi, parents and educationists had demand that free education be extended till class 12. But no state has extended it till now.</p><p>As per Delhi school education rules, private schools on government land have to provide free education to EWS students up to class 12. But, there is no such compulsion on schools on private land.</p><p>Advocate and president of All India Parents Association Ashok Agarwal had filed a PIL in the Delhi high court demanding the extension of free education till class 12 in 2019. “The Centre had last month informed the court that it is not considering an extension. Who will take responsibility for the children already enrolled under RTE? The centre and state governments should come together to amend the RTE Act and extend it up to the senior-most class that a school offers. Meanwhile, the state governments can also reimburse schools for students who have reached class 9 and are struggling to pay the fee,” he said.</p><p>A senior official of the Delhi government, who asked not to be named, said the decision of extending the free education till class 12 cannot be taken by a state government unilaterally. “Presently, central and state governments are sharing the reimbursement cost paid to schools under the RTE Act in a 60:40 ratio. If the state takes any decision of extending the Act, it will have to bear the entire cost. So, any decision of extending the Act will be taken either by amending the Act or on a mutual understanding between governments on how to share the cost,” the official said.</p><p>Meanwhile, parents are left to endure the uncertainty and worry about raising the fee.</p><p>For instance, NC Jindal Public School in Punjabi Bagh sent letters (HT has seen them) to parents of over 50 EWS students on March 20 and told them to pay the fee by April 10.</p><p>“You’ll also be required to furnish an undertaking that you will continue to do so in the future also. In case you fail to inform that you are willing to pay the fees of your ward as per the general category students or fail to respond to this letter, the name of your ward will stand struck off from the school register with effect from March 31, 2021,” the letter read.</p><p>The father of a class 9 student at the school, who asked not to be named, alleged that his son had not been able to join his online classes. “The school never told us that our child would be transferred to the general category after class 8. We have no means to pay (the fee of) <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>7,000 a month. It’s more than half my monthly salary. I don’t know what to do. I am thinking of taking a loan for my son’s education now,” he said.</p><p>School principal DK Pandey did not respond to calls, messages and emails seeking comment.</p><p>Another school in west Delhi, Hansraj Model School, sent a similar letter to parents of over 100 EWS students and told them to pay the fee by April 15.</p><p>The mother of a class 9 student at that school, requesting anonymity, said, “My husband works at a tea shop and by no means will we be able to pay the fee of a private school. We have no option but to shift him to a government school, though he is totally against it. He started crying when we told him that we are planning to change his school.”</p><p>School principal Heemal Handu Bhat did not respond to calls, messages and emails seeking comment.</p><p>Parents of both these schools had protested against the letters and submitted a memorandum to the Delhi lieutenant-governor demanding an extension of free education up to class 12 on Friday.</p><p>In the past two years, while some parents have already transferred their wards from private to government schools, others have been trying to arrange money by whatever means possible.</p><p>The father of a class 10 student at St Thomas School, Dwarka, said the school had withheld his son’s class 9 results. “Last year, when he started class 9, the lockdown had been imposed and the school did not ask us for money. It was in October that we got to know that my son had been transferred to the general category and we were supposed to pay the fee. I somehow managed to pay the fee for two months after which he was allowed to appear for the exams. Now the school has asked me to pay the fee dues in order to release his results,” he said.</p><p>When contacted, school principal Menaka Singh said in an email response: “We would like to state that as in the past, our school continues to comply with the RTE Act, Delhi School Education Act, and all other applicable laws. We have no further comment.”</p><p>Among those who have been forced to switch to a government school in class 9 was Kavyanshi, a resident of Tilak Nagar. Her parents shifted her to a government school last October after failing to pay her private school fee. “I am still trying to adjust with my new teachers and classmates. It feels like my entire world has changed,” she said.</p>","<p>Four days after 13 students and two staff members of Delhi University’s St. Stephen’s tested positive for Covid-19, the college on Monday said it will reopen its entire campus, barring two blocks, from Tuesday.

Some of those interacted with us, had meals, and shared rooms while they carried the virus. The situation is better now and testing has been initiated. Now, we have a volunteer team who take packed food to those isolated in the two blocks.”</p><p>Until the incident, teachers were using the college to hold staggered classes for hostel residents and local Delhi students and to conduct online lessons. “We had been planning to start blended offline-online classes for our students after Easter. But that doesn’t look possible now. A lot of students and teachers don’t have the confidence to try and hold in-person classes because it would be too risky due to the surge in cases again,” said Nandita Narain, who teaches Mathematics in the college.</p><p>Principal Varghese said the college had conducted a Covid test for all resident students, housekeeping and mess staff on Saturday and all were found to be Covid-negative.</p>","<p>At least seven students of Arya Kanya Gurukul in New Rajinder Nagar tested positive for Covid-19 following which the institute was shut on Monday until further orders, school officials said.

Usha Sareen, manager of the gurukul, said, “None of our students tested positive in the rapid antigen testing. So, we sent them for RT-PCR testing, the results of which arrived on Sunday. Seven students were positive and six of them have returned to their homes, while one is quarantined at the school. We are closely monitoring the student and taking all precautions.”</p><p>The school, which is operated by women’s group Pranti Arya Mahila Association, offers education from class 4 to class 12. “Around 130 students have been staying on-campus since last December. The president of mahila association had first tested positive and hospitalised. Some students, who had come in her contact, later developed symptoms. We have sent all students back to their homes. We have sanitised the gurukul and closed it until further orders,” Sareen said.</p><p>With Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the national capital, several schools have reported incidents of staff and students testing positive for Covid. A private school in west Delhi on Monday cancelled a scheduled exam after a class 12 student tested positive. In a message sent to parents on Sunday, the school said, “Due to some unforeseen circumstance, the class 12 improvement test of physics and accountancy scheduled on April 5 stands cancelled.” The school has advised students who came in contact with the student concerned to get themselves tested before coming back to the campus.</p><p>In Delhi, only students enrolled in classes 9 to 12 for the academic session 2020-21 have been allowed to come to schools for practicals, remedial classes, and exams.</p><p>Meanwhile, the principal and some staff members of another private school, DAV Sreshta Vihar, have also tested positive for Covid-19.

Of many graveyards and of many old unknown graves littered across the landscape—today finding themselves by the busy avenues, amid the municipality gardens, along the chai stalls, and on less travelled footpaths where they remain hidden from view. Some of these graves are famous, a few are venerated as shrines of mystics, but most lie in neglect.</p><p>This grave stands like another black hole in the city’s past. It clearly has to be of some eminent person. The structure is standing higher than the usual anonymous graves one is used to in the city. The grave’s stony surface seems uneven, as if forced to melt and solidify successively by the passage of several centuries and seasons. The plinth on which it stands appears to give the illusion of molten lava, newly stiffened. This sunny afternoon it looks cheerful, as if content in anonymity.</p><p>Nearby, a man is lying on the pavement, sleeping soundly under the shade of a tree.</p><p>Since the grave is across the road from the northern walls of the 16th century Humayun tomb monument, it might date from early Mughal-era, but it would be difficult to confirm its exact period. The gravestone is cracked, and damp, and is unadorned, without any design or calligraphy, giving no clue about the person underneath.</p><p>It isn’t necessary to try to know more. In an era when every city street has been mapped for your mobile phone apps, and when you might Google something scandalous even on your boring anonymous neighbour, it is a consolation that some spots have escaped the tyranny of information. And that the person buried in this grave, for instance, is able to enjoy the precious right to be forgotten.</p><p>Now a lonely-seeming animal appears, jumps over the grave and plops along its stone surface.

HT had on Sunday reported that while the new academic session had started in schools across the national capital last week, the admission process for these 25% reserved seats was delayed, causing anxiety among parents seeking to enrol their children in private schools.</p><p>Officials at the DoE had cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason behind the delay in starting admissions for the reserved seats. This year, the application process for 75% general category seats too had been delayed by over two months due to the pandemic.</p><p>According to a notification released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday, the forms for reserved categories will be available on the official website (edudel.nic.in) from Wednesday, and the last date of submission of the same will be April 26. The first list of selected candidates will be released on April 30. Applicants have been asked to file only one application. “Multiple applications filed by any individual applicant shall lead to cancellation of candidature of the applicant, even after succeeding in the draw of lots,” the notification said.</p><p>All private schools affiliated by the three municipal corporations — north, south, and east — as well as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will also be in the computerised admission system.</p><p>The DoE has fixed an upper age limit of 5, 6, and 7 years as of March 31, 2021, for admission in nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years as of March 31, 2021, respectively. However, the upper age limit for children with disabilities is 9 years for admission to these classes.</p><p>Families having less than an annual income of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1 lakh can apply for admission under the EWS category. “Any person residing in Delhi, having the residence proof of Delhi and requisite Income Certificate (less than one lakh rupees annually) issued by the Revenue Department of GNCT of Delhi, BPL/AAY( ration card/ food security cardholder) are eligible for applying in these private unaided recognized schools for admission of their ward under EWS category,” the notification read.</p><p>Under the disadvantaged groups category, Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe, Other Backward Class (non-creamy layer), orphans, transgender, and all children living with or affected by HIV, can apply, according to the DoE notification. Applicants under the children with disabilities category must have to submit a disability certificate issued from a government hospital as per the guidelines issued under the Right of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016.</p><p>“Income certificate is also not required for applicant sunder Children with Disabilities Category,” the notification added.</p><p>Meanwhile, some experts raised concerns over the short period for the application process this year. Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organization working with EWS children in Delhi, said, “It will be very difficult for poor children to fill forms at such short notice. It has to be opened for at least a month. Poor children should not be made to pay for the lack of planning and foresight of the education department.”</p><p>Anil Kumar, a labourer at Molarband extension in Badarpur who is seeking admission for his sons, aged 5 and 6, said he was relieved that the government initiated the admission process for reserved category.</p><p>“I was really worried due to the delay in the commencement of admission process. I just hope that my sons get seats in a good private school under the EWS category,” he said.</p>","<p>District magistrates across Delhi received at least 30,000 applications seeking exemptions from the city’s night curfew restrictions announced on Tuesday, said officials with knowledge of developments.</p><p>Having received the night curfew order just nine hours prior to its implementation, city authorities also started preparations to issue the necessary passes and coordinate efforts to enforce the curbs.</p><p>The city government on Tuesday clamped a curfew on movement and assembly of people between 10pm and 5am until April 30.

Police said the arrested man, identified as Padam Panwar, was purportedly seen in a video clip, which was widely circulated on social media, proclaiming that Sai Baba is a Muslim and not a God.</p><p>Panwar, a resident of Shahpur Jat, was arrested on Monday, a day after police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs), said a senior police officer who did not want to be named.</p><p>The officer said that police began enquiring into the demolition after receiving a complaint from local devotees on April 3. The first information report was registered on April 4. “Panwar was arrested after his role was confirmed. He has been sent to jail,” the officer added.</p><p>Police said that during questioning, some people claimed that they intended to replace the statue as it was found to be cracked. However, when HT contacted Panwar, he had said that he decided to get it removed as Sai Baba was a Muslim. “I personally got the statue installed in 2009. But now that I got to know that Sai Baba was a Muslim, I got the statue removed. Sai Baba was no God, he was a common man,” Panwar, who is in the real estate business, had said.</p><p>In the video doing the rounds of social media, a man is purportedly seen using tools to demolish the statue after which Panwar comes to the fore, and says, “This temple was constructed by my ancestors even before Shirdi Baba was born. But I have got to know he is Muslim. He cannot share the same space that is occupied by Hindu gods.”</p><p>A video also emerged in which Panwar is purportedly seen in the company of Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati -- a priest of Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad -- who was booked by the Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly making inflammatory comments against the Prophet at a press conference in the national capital.</p>","<p>Delhi is likely to see a partly cloudy sky on Wednesday as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast.</p><p>The minimum temperature on Wednesday is likely to be 21 degrees Celsius while maximum temperature is predicted to reach 37 degrees Celsius.</p><p>The minimum temperature on Tuesday was 20.4 degrees Celsius, one notch above normal and maximum temperature was 38.2 degrees Celsius -- three degrees above normal.</p><p>Delhi’s air quality was in the poor category on Wednesday morning.

The city on Tuesday recorded 5,100 new cases and 17 deaths due to the viral infection, even as it set a new record for daily tests.</p><p>The increase in cases has been sharper during the “fourth wave” – as the Delhi government refers to the current surge, with the numbers rising from under 1,000 to over 5,000 in just 15 days..</p><p>Experts, however, say this is the second spike that the city is witnessing.</p><p>Despite the high number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% due to the high number of tests conducted. The city reported a positivity rate of 4.93% on Tuesday, with 103,453 test having been conducted the previous day, as per the health bulletin. Tuesday was the first time the city has seen over 100,000 tests in a day.</p><p>“The number of cases has definitely gone up faster this time around. This is because many people who are positive are moving around and restaurants and gyms are open. Normally, there is a surge in cases within 60 to 100 days of easing of restrictions. This is the natural behaviour of the virus. And, this is likely to continue till April or maybe May,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on control and management of Covid-19 cases.</p><p>He added that the number of cases this time might even cross the record of daily cases set during the “third” peak of November. On November 11, Delhi had reported 8,593 cases, the highest till date for the city.</p><p>In addition to the night curfew, Sarin said that studies have shown that the restaurants should only offer outdoor seating or give takeaways.</p><p>“Restaurants and bars lead to the spread of the infection; you have to remove your mask if you have to eat or drink. An interesting study from the Columbia district in Washington DC showed that when restaurants were opened up after following strict masking norms, the number of cases increased 10-fold and number of deaths five-fold in 100 days,” he said.</p><p>The experts said that asymptomatic transmission was a major cause of concern during the current surge. “It has now been established that nearly 60% of the transmission can happen from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Targeting only those with symptoms, such as fever, is not good enough. We need to trace more contacts and quarantine them,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.</p><p>He added, “The pool of people transmitting silently will only increase as more and more people get vaccinated. This is because those who receive even one shot of the vaccine get some amount of immunity and are likely to have milder symptoms. They are also likely to not get tested and hence transmit it on to others.”</p><p>Dr Sarin agreed, adding, “The antibodies which form after an infection or immunisation are almost same. And, over 50% of Delhi’s population is seropositive. They are moving around and if they get the infection, and they can, they will have mild symptoms and may pass on the infection to others.”</p><p>Both experts said that there is a need to increase vaccinations. With the Centre opening up vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years, Delhi’s drive has also picked up pace. A record 87,678 doses were administered on Monday, of which 73% were given at government facilities, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.</p><p>As per provisional reports, 74,642 doses were administered on Tuesday. This comes a day after the government announced that at least one-third of the vaccination centres in 33 Delhi government hospitals will run 24x7 Tuesday onwards.</p><p>“Around 95% of the total slots in government centres were utilised as compared to 67% in private hospitals. The trend was the opposite initially when the vaccination drive had begun. However, people are now happy with the facilities in government centres and are coming there,” said Jain. So far, 1.38 million persons in Delhi have been administered at least one shot of the vaccine.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cases increase, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has stopped walk-in registrations at its out-patient clinics which had been restarted in December. “To optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources … Covid-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily close down routine walk-in OPD,” read an order from the medical superintendent of the hospital.</p>","<p>Tikri and Singhu, two important border roads between Delhi and Haryana, remained fully closed on Wednesday as farmers continued with their agitation against the three farm laws. </p><p>Along the Delhi-UP border, one carriageway of the Ghazipur border is open for those travelling to Ghaziabad from Delhi, even as farmers continued blocking the other road of the elevated highway.</p><p>The Delhi Police in its advisory have asked commuters to take routes passing through Anand Vihar, DND, Loni DND and Apsara borders.

"<p> Indian astronomers have tracked a rare supernova explosion and traced it to one of the hottest kinds of stars called ‘Wolf-Rayet’ or WR stars. Supernovae (SNe) are highly energetic explosions in the universe releasing an enormous amount of energy.</p><p>Long-term monitoring of these transients opens the door to understand the nature of the exploding star as well as the explosion properties. It can also help enumerate the number of massive stars, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said in a statement.</p><p>The rare Wolf–Rayet stars are highly luminous objects, a thousand times more than the Sun and have intrigued astronomers for long.

They calculated the mass of the star that collapsed to form the supernovae as well as the geometry of its ejection.</p><p>This work was recently published in The Astrophysical Journal.</p><p>The scientists also found that the original star was a combination of two stars, one of them is a massive WR star and another much less in mass than the sun, the statement added.</p>","<p>Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago analyzed gene expression in fresh brain tissue and found that gene expression in some cells actually increased after death.</p><p>In the hours after we die, certain cells in the human brain are still active. Some cells even increase their activity and grow to gargantuan proportions, according to new research from the University of Illinois Chicago.</p><p>In a newly published study in the journal Scientific Reports, the UIC researchers analyzed gene expression in fresh brain tissue -- which was collected during routine brain surgery -- at multiple times after removal to simulate the post-mortem interval and death. They found that gene expression in some cells actually increased after death.</p><p>These 'zombie genes' -- those that increased expression after the post-mortem interval -- were specific to one type of cell: inflammatory cells called glial cells. The researchers observed that glial cells grow and sprout long arm-like appendages for many hours after death.</p><p>""That glial cells enlarge after death isn't too surprising given that they are inflammatory and their job is to clean things up after brain injuries like oxygen deprivation or stroke,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Loeb, the John S. Garvin Professor and head of neurology and rehabilitation at the UIC College of Medicine and corresponding author on the paper.</p><p>What's significant, Loeb said, is the implications of this discovery -- most research studies that use postmortem human brain tissues to find treatments and potential cures for disorders such as autism, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, do not account for the post-mortem gene expression or cell activity.</p><p>""Most studies assume that everything in the brain stops when the heart stops beating, but this is not so,"" Loeb said. ""Our findings will be needed to interpret research on human brain tissues. We just haven't quantified these changes until now.""</p><p>Loeb and his team noticed that the global pattern of gene expression in fresh human brain tissue didn't match any of the published reports of postmortem brain gene expression from people without neurological disorders or from people with a wide variety of neurological disorders, ranging from autism to Alzheimer's.</p><p>""We decided to run a simulated death experiment by looking at the expression of all human genes, at time points from 0 to 24 hours, from a large block of recently collected brain tissues, which were allowed to sit at room temperature to replicate the postmortem interval,"" Loeb said.</p><p>Loeb and colleagues are at a particular advantage when it comes to studying brain tissue. Loeb is director of the UI NeuroRepository, a bank of human brain tissues from patients with neurological disorders who have consented to having tissue collected and stored for research either after they die, or during standard of care surgery to treat disorders such as epilepsy.</p><p>For example, during certain surgeries to treat epilepsy, epileptic brain tissue is removed to help eliminate seizures. Not all of the tissue is needed for pathological diagnosis, so some can be used for research. This is the tissue that Loeb and colleagues analyzed in their research.</p><p>They found that about 80% of the genes analyzed remained relatively stable for 24 hours -- their expression didn't change much.

The timeless appeal makes these weaves coveted heirlooms. Passed from generations, these are undoubtedly a staple of every coming-of-age woman’s wardrobe. The sub-continent is a land steeped in myriad traditions of arts and crafts, from time immemorial and there still exists written records of Greek scholars waxing eloquent on the quality of Indian cloth and craftsmanship. “The craft has been passed down generations. There is no institute that can teach you how to weave - it is a precious and unique technique,” confesses designer Anju Modi who has worked a lot on the Banarasi weave. Somewhat misnamed, the Banarasi weave did not originate in Benares, rather legend has it, “A famine during the mid-16th century caused the silk weavers from Gujarat to move to Banaras and thereby started the weaving of silk and brocades in Banaras,” decodes designer Kshitij Jalori. With the change in times and the changing fashion landscape, designers have toyed with the motifs and silhouettes to make it more appealing to the millennials today. In 2013, we saw designer duo Abraham and Thakore collection with contemporary chattai (mat) weaves woven in them. Designer Sanjay Garg’s interpretation of stripes and contemporary take on Banarasi weaves, designer Amit Aggarwal’s electric twist to sarees, designer Rajesh Pratap Singh’s work with the Banaras loom amalgamated with modern silhouettes and designer Tanira Sethi’s origami motifs weaved onto Banarasi sarees are examples of the evolution of the timeless weave. Even though traditionally, the colours, aesthetics and techniques of Banarasi saree are timeless, designer Anju Modi believes in the need to innovate and make the saree relatable to current aesthetic tastes. With continuous design intervention the Banarasi saree of today has evolved with current designs, “With geometric patterns juxtaposed with floral artwork. Now we can wear sarees on which animal figures, calligraphy, folk art, jewellery and many more motifs and designs are made. Even in terms of its making, it is no longer just silk and cotton, but many other yarns are blended,” says designer Gautam Gupta. A majority of Banarasi sarees being sold in the market are a heterogeneous mix of the old and the new, however owning a Banarasi saree is still coveted, inspirational for many Indian families. Designer Ritu Kumar feels that owning one traditional Banarasi silk saree is aspirational for many families in India. It is common to hear designers remain nostalgic about the old ways, rightly so and Kumar adds, “In an attempt to put in some European motifs, some mix and match ones during the twentieth century, what has happened is that now most of these sarees are unwearable. They look wonderful from a distance but up close you will notice that they change the yarn to a Chinese yarn which is stiff and the gold will be changed to some lurex yarns with large motifs, baluchar pallu, or a pallu from Gujarat or South India mixed with the bootis they used to have there. As a result, the sense of balance in most of these sarees seems to have gotten confused if not lost.” Through her Benares revival programme, Kumar has recreated fabric that has the original yarn and the bootis which are barely seen today, thus once again attempting to purify the sacrosanct art of Banaras saree craftsmanship by sifting out the residue of alien elements. </p>","<p>Seen on the likes of Dolly Parton, who recently opted for a vaccine-ready, sparkly blue knit top with cutout shoulder detailing as she got her first shot of the Moderna vaccine, the ‘90s style has made a comeback like never before! The country singer’s top slashed on the shoulder was custom made by her creative director, Steve Summers. “I even have a little cutout in my shirt — I matched it over here,” she told the doctor, who administered the shot, pointing to her other shoulder.  As Dolly was taking her Pfizer shot, the nurse quipped, “Everyone’s wearing these tops.” Reportedly an array of shopping platforms have clocked in increased searches for cold-shoulder tops since the start of March.</p><p>Dolly’s utilitarian style pick has catalysed a cold shoulder vaccine shirt/top frenzy. The next day, politician and diplomat Hillary Clinton posted a throwback photograph of herself on Instagram from 1993 in which she sports a noir cold-shoulder dress by Donna Karan. “Loved seeing @dollypartonbring back the cold shoulder as a vaccination look,” she wrote. “Shall we make this a trend?”</p><p>A key insignia of the minimal ‘90s, Donna had put it on the map when she dressed supermodel Linda Evangelista for her Fall 1991 outing in a monochrome variation worn under a matching jacket. While fashion critics booed it back then, Clinton continued to stay loyal to it during her early years as the FLOTUS.</p><p>The likes of designers Phoebe Philo (who helmed Celine back then) and Proenza Schouler reinterpreted the cold shoulder style in their collections later.</p><p>“Thanks to Dolly Parton, cold shoulder tops and dresses seem to be the chic picks to take the jab. Also, they’re on trend seen on both runways and racks,” says designer Shruti Sancheti.</p><p>Designer Nikita Mhaisalkar sees the trend’s popularity as an open approach to make it clear and loud that the world is open to get vaccinated and beat the pandemic! “It’s a stylish way fashionistas have chosen to say ‘being vaccinated is a way of life’,“ says Nikita.</p><p>“From Dolly Parton to Lululemons to getting named as ‘vaccine shirts’, we couldn’t imagine they would take over the viral list. No doubt, it is a smart alternative and aesthetic practicality to ease the go and which makes sense too,” says designer Prreeti Jaiin Nainutia of label Nirmooha.</p><p>“Cold shoulder is a key trend as our kaftan style with cold shoulder details have been quite popular. Women who are 40 plus have loved this style as they don’t want to wear sleeveless and they also want to have a bit of sexiness. This style is flattering and slims you down. Those who don’t want to wear sleeveless - cold shoulders are a great bet. Of course it’s great for vaccination,” says designer Pria Kataaria Puri, who’s experimenting with kaftans with cold shoulder styles for the coming summer.  </p>","<p>Disha Patani has a drool-worthy wardrobe.

Cut to last year when Neha Kakkar played the coy, ghoonghat bride in a fiery red Falguni Shane Peacock creation. A spate of recently unveiled bridal campaigns too bring the spotlight on the veil. If Manish Malhotra’s ivory georgette kalidar is layered with a handcrafted veil, Suneet Varma’s mirror work lehenga comes adorned with an ice blue veil. Ghoonghat is a trend-less bridal essential, which has been etched in the Indian mythology, history and literature, however, it makes all the more sense to embrace it now with pandemic refusing to subside. </p><p>Also, ghoonghat’s current iteration comes in sheer gossamer fabric - it’s translucent, revealing and has a playful peekaboo feel.

The recently unveiled bridal campaigns present veils with a theatrical edge and it’s a dramatic twist to the traditional ghoonghat.”  </p><p>The ghoonghat has been an integral part of bridal attire for centuries. In recent times it has gained immense popularity among modern brides because the sneak peek factor doesn’t compare. Designer Ridhi Mehra says, “It’s the power play of that peekaboo effect and looking at her face through that thin veil that makes it truly attractive! For brides who want the classic look of elegance and magnificence, don the classic look with a red sheer ghoonghat or try an avante-garde twist with a veil featuring an attached veil for the face.

It is true that human behaviour cannot be fully regulated by norms. However, it is our endeavour through improved processes and disclosures to bring in greater balance, transparency and quality in the selection of independent directors and functioning of the corporate boards,” Tyagi said.</p><p>There are about 6,800 listed firms and Sebi’s listing obligations and disclosure regulations (LODR) require them to adhere to basic corporate governance standards so that no stakeholder is treated inequitably.</p><p>Sebi’s primary aim to have independent directors in listed firms is to ensure that investments made by millions of small retail shareholders in these entities do no face unfair risks.</p><p>On March 1, Sebi issued a consultation paper proposing to make the process of appointment and resignation of independent directors transparent.</p><p>Sebi wants a company to secure dual approval, one from the board and the other from minority shareholders, both for appointments and resignations of independent directors. At present, an independent director is appointed if approved by a majority of shareholders, including the promoter and non-promoters.</p><p>Sebi has also proposed that if an independent director exits a board, the full resignation letter should be disclosed to the stock exchanges. It has also proposed that instead of profit-linked commissions, independent directors should be remunerated through long-duration stock options.</p><p>Towards the end of 2018, several independent directors of jailed businessman Rana Kapoor-promoted Yes Bank had quit the bank’s board through a series of resignations. However, the actual letters of resignations were not disclosed to the public by the bank, whose board was eventually taken over by a Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator and subsequently replaced by a new board after State Bank of India picked up a majority stake in the bank to salvage it from becoming a complete failure.</p><p>Tyagi re-emphasized the need to separate the roles of chairperson and managing director in Indian firms. “The underlying idea for such a separation is not to weaken the position of promoter, but to improve corporate governance. The objective is to provide a better and more balanced governance structure by enabling more effective supervision of the management. Separation of the roles will reduce excessive concentration of authority in a single individual. Having the same person as chairman and managing director brings in a conflict of interest,” he said.</p>","<p>The Adani group became the third Indian conglomerate to surpass $100 billion in market value as a dizzying rally in the shares of Gautam Adani-run companies propelled the group past many titans of Indian industry.</p><p>On Tuesday, shares of four of the six publicly traded Adani group companies soared to a record.

They are also considering taking on the added cost of vaccinating staff. “A lot of the front-end staff will be asked to go home. Putting curbs on delivery till 8pm also is a major blow to business as a lot of people don’t order dinner before 8 pm. This could easily lead to dinner-time orders dropping 50%,” said Pranav Rungta, chapter head, Mumbai at the National Restaurant Association of India.</p><p>Mall executives said they are closely watching how the situation develops.

Thus, the stringent restrictions put in place will lower India’s GVA growth to 9.92% for FY22 and bring GDP growth down to 10.7-10.9%, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings.</p><p>“Care Ratings had estimated growth of 10.24% in GVA for FY22 for India towards the end of March, where it was assumed there would be return to normalcy during the year. But, with FY22 starting on a sombre note with a lockdown fully in place for Maharashtra and to a lesser extent in other states, overall production and consumption would be affected,” he said.</p><p>The finance ministry, however, said India is well-equipped to combat the effects of the virus. “Instrumental in this resilience will be a strong revival in investment growth supported by the Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission and a massive boost to infrastructure and capital expenditure provided for in the Union budget.

A figure above 50 indicates expansion, while sub-50 signals contraction. The headline figure, however, remained above its long-run average of 53.6.</p><p>IHS Markit said anecdotal evidence suggested that the upturn was stymied by elevated cost pressures. “On the price front, the rate of input cost inflation was among the strongest seen in the past three years. However, selling prices increased only moderately as companies limited their adjustments to retain a competitive edge and boost sales,” it added.</p><p>Pollyanna De Lima, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said survey participants indicated that demand growth was constrained by the escalation of the covid pandemic, while the rise in input buying was curtailed by an intensification of cost pressures. “While predictions that the vaccination programme will curb the disease and underpin output growth in the year ahead meant that business confidence remained positive, growing uncertainty over the near-term outlook due to a rise in covid cases dragged sentiment to a seven-month low. With covid curbs expanded and lockdowns re-introduced in many states, Indian manufacturers look set to experience a challenging month in April,” she added.</p><p>Employment declined in March at the quickest pace since September 2020, taking the current sequence of job shedding to a year. Business confidence also waned.</p><p>“While some firms foresee output growth in the coming 12 months, the vast majority predicted no change from present levels. Where optimism was signalled, this was commonly pinned on hopes that covid controls would ease,” IHS Markit said.</p><p>Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings, said the series of localized lockdowns have the potential to disrupt the economy again. “The issue is this affects the services sector, which was just about getting up post-November.

In addition, Saudi Arabia cut output by 1 million barrels per day since February this year.</p><p>OPEC+, led by Saudi Arabia is, however, reluctant to restore output with demand recovery as the supply squeeze saw Brent soaring over 250% in about 11 months, a second official said. “Under US pressure, the cartel on Thursday agreed to raise some output from May, but that may not be sufficient to cool down prices,” he said. The squeeze saw Brent surging to around $70 a barrel on March 11, 2021.</p><p>“It is unfair to manipulate production to keep oil prices high. It is against the market principle. When oil prices plunged below $20, India had supported cartel’s decision of reducing production cut. Now, when demand is back, they must resume full production.

During the financial year 2010-11, all domestic air operators together had flown a total of 53.8 million passengers on local routes, according to ratings agency ICRA. </p><p>The domestic passenger traffic in March 2021 has been estimated at around 77-78 lakh, a marginal decline of about 1 per cent over February during which airlines had flown around 78.30 lakh passengers, it said. </p><p>“For FY2021 (May 25, 2020 till March 31, 2021), domestic passenger traffic has been pegged at around 53.4 million, a year-on-year decline of about 62 per cent over the fiscal ended March 31, 2020, in line with ICRA's estimates,” it said. </p><p>Domestic passenger traffic in March 2021 has been estimated at around 77-78 lakh, implying a flat growth on a y-o-y basis on a low base of March 2020 (which had witnessed a y-o-y decline of 33.1 per cent in domestic passenger traffic) as domestic travel was affected with effect from March 25, Icra said. Domestic passenger traffic witnesses a flat year-on-year growth in March 2021 owing to low base, Icra said, adding the recent spike in cases poses challenge for sector's recovery. </p><p>The airlines' capacity for March 2021 was around 2 per cent higher at around 71,300 departures than 69,910 departures in March. On a sequential basis, the number of departures in March 2021 were higher by about 11 per cent, Icra said. For March, the average daily departures were around 2,300, higher than the average daily departures of 2,255 in March 2020, owing to cessation of domestic travel for the last seven days of the month previous fiscal, and marginally higher than around 2,296 in February this year, said Kinjal Shah, Vice President ICRA. </p><p>Domestic scheduled passenger services were suspended from March 25, 2020 to curb the pandemic, and were resumed only from May 25, 2020. </p><p>The average number of passengers per flight during March 2021 was 109, against an average of 111 passengers per flight in March 2020, she said, adding, it is, therefore, expected that the domestic aviation industry operated at a passenger load factor (PLF) of around 72 per cent in March 2021, against a PLF of 73.1 per cent in March 2020, which was also impacted by the pandemic. </p><p>""The PLF for March 2021 was lower than the around 79 per cent in February 2021, due to the increase in capacity deployment by about 11 per cent. Overall, for FY2021, domestic passenger traffic has been pegged at around 53.4 million, declining 62 per cent over FY 2020 traffic,” Shah said. </p>","<p>India on Tuesday pitched for greater coordination among BRICS nations on the issue of the 16th general review of quotas of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to give more say to developing countries.</p><p>As per an IMF resolution, the 16th General Review of Quotas should be concluded by December 15, 2023.</p><p>Any adjustment in quota shares would be expected to result in increase in the voting rights of emerging countries in line with their relative positions in the world economy.</p><p>It would likely result in an increase in the share of emerging markets and developing countries as a whole, while protecting the voice and representation of the poorest members. </p><p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while chairing the BRICS Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting, emphasised on the need for the five-nation grouping to respond to the COVID-19 crisis through policy support and enhanced international coordination.</p><p>Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) are members of the grouping.</p><p>As the 2021 BRICS Chair, India's approach is focused on strengthening intra-BRICS cooperation based on continuity, consolidation and consensus, the finance ministry said in a statement.</p><p>""This was the first meeting of the BRICS Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors under India Chairship in 2021.</p><p>""BRICS Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors discussed financial cooperation agenda set by India for 2021 - Global Economic Outlook and Response to COVID-19 pandemic, New Development Bank (NDB) Activities, Social Infrastructure Financing and Use of Digital Technologies, Cooperation on Customs related issues, IMF reforms, Fintech for SMEs and Financial Inclusion,"" it said. </p><p>On the BRICS priorities and agenda for 2021, Sitharaman said efforts should be made towards delivering outcomes that reflect the needs and aspirations of the group in particular and emerging markets and developing economies in general.</p><p>She also stressed on thematic priorities for the New Development Bank for discussion during 2021 and the issue of membership expansion.</p><p>On the COVID-19 pandemic, the finance minister said the world's largest vaccination drive is underway in India and it has supplied 64.5 million vaccine doses to 84 countries. </p><p>Speaking on the importance of social infrastructure and use of digital technologies, Sitharaman underscored the merit in engaging with private sector and exploring the innovative financing models. </p><p>Sitharaman also said the Prime Minister's Health Insurance Scheme using an output-based funding model has triggered a major private investment cycle in healthcare infrastructure.

We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar for climate talks ahead of US President Biden’s summit on climate, which will be held on April 22-23.</p><p>“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. We discussed a range of issues including climate finance, joint research and collaboration etc,” Javadekar tweeted after the meeting.</p><p>In his address to the SAWIE Summit, Kerry said: “I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies.”</p><p>“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours,” he said.</p><p>According to a senior environment ministry official, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Biden will take steps to put the US on an “irreversible path” to a net zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations in order to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.</p><p>“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country – especially for a lower-middle income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment.

The rasping sounds of lobsters go quiet.</p><p>While Cuba’s marine life has suffered from overfishing and pollution, there is mounting evidence that the warming of waters due to climate change may be taking a large toll as well -- both off the island's coast and globally.</p><p>Research published Monday finds that the total number of open-water species declined by about half in the 40 years up to 2010 in tropical marine zones worldwide.

It uses data learning and prediction techniques to calculate real time values about the engine in petrol and diesel vehicles and other subsystems’ performance, says a study.</p><p>“Based on these performance indicators, the driver of the engine can manoeuvre the vehicle accordingly to improve efficiency and decrease emissions. Automotive engine manufacturers can also programme these algorithms to provide automatic control for better efficiency,” said the lead author of the study, Tushar Jain, assistant professor, School of Computing and Electrical Engineering at IIT Mandi.</p><p>The development has potential for making significant impact since IC engines fuelled by petrol and diesel comprise 99.8% of global transport, including airplanes and boats. They are also responsible for 10% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2020 study by US and UK-based researchers.</p><p>“Currently there are no systems to measure efficiency of an engine or other systems in the vehicle. For example, it’s difficult to know exactly how much fuel is flowing into the engine as typical sensors will get damaged during motion since the pistons are constantly moving,” said Jain, whose team comprised research scholar Vyoma Singh and Birupaksha Pal from the Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited (RBEBSPL), Bengaluru. </p><p>Their work appeared online in the global peer-reviewed International Journal of Systems Science, Taylor &amp; Francis, on February 21. Jain said they are in the process of applying for patents.</p><p>Amit Shukla, assistant professor, School of Engineering, IIT Mandi, who was not a part of the study, said the estimation of real performance of IC engines is a major challenge and the Jain and his team’s methodology will help to develop better optimised and controlled engines.</p><p>“Although there is strong intention to move towards electrical energy-based propulsion systems, in reality, we are still far away from that goal of complete electrification of the transportation sector. In such a situation optimisation of IC engine by improving its fuel efficiency, while minimising resultant emission is one of the best near-term solutions,” said Shukla.</p><p>The researchers have benchmarked the performance of their methodology by comparing it with that of the state-of-the-art estimation methods. The numerical stability and robustness of their proposed methodology are analysed through rigorous Monte Carlo simulations and found to be superior to other methods, said Jain.</p>"

Pope Francis lamented that the pandemic has prevented some churchgoers from attending services.</p><p>At St. Peter's Basilica, the 200 or so faithful allowed to attend looked lost in the cavernous cathedral. Normally, thousands would be at the Mass celebrated by Francis, and more than 100,00 would sometimes assemble outside in St. Peter's Square to receive his Easter blessing afterward.</p><p>But this year, as in 2020, crowds are banned from gathering in Italy and at the Vatican. Francis delivered his noon Easter address on world affairs from inside the basilica, using the occasion to appeal anew that vaccines reach the poorest countries.</p><p>The pontiff sounded weary as he noted that pandemic measures have affected religious holiday traditions and kept some faithful from public worship.</p><p>""We pray that these restrictions, as well as all restrictions on freedom of worship and religion worldwide, may be lifted and everyone be allowed to pray and praise God freely,'' Francis said.</p><p>In Syria, where a national vaccination program has yet to begin, churchgoers in the Lady of Damascus Church prayed for a way out of the economic and political crisis, only worsened by the pandemic.</p><p>“We came to the church for Easter so we get rid of the pandemic that we are in,” said Bassam Assaf. “Of course, we are not scared of coronavirus. It is the reality that we face, but it cannot stop us from coming and praying to God to take us out of this ordeal and help the world.”</p><p>A service at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in the Old City of Jerusalem was celebrated by the senior Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land. That is the site where many Christians believe Jesus was crucified, buried and rose from the dead. Israel's successful vaccination campaign has allowed reopening of many places, including religious sites.</p><p>The pandemic kept Seville’s Brotherhood of the Holy Resurrection from sending its ornate Easter float, bearing a towering statue of Jesus, through the streets of the Spanish city. Instead, the Brotherhood posted videos and old photos from their last procession, two years ago.</p><p>Some Pentecostal Christians in South Africa canceled a three-day retreat starting on Good Friday. On the hills overlooking Soweto, a Johannesburg township, Apostolic Pentecostals gathered in small groups Sunday to mark Easter.</p><p>In South Korea, Yoido Full Gospel Church, the country's biggest Protestant church, allowed only about 2,000 people to attend Easter service, or about 17% of the capacity of the main building. Masked worshippers sang hymns and prayed as the service was broadcast online and by Christian TV channels.</p><p>Intent on tamping down weeks of surging infections, the Italian government ordered people to stay home for the three-day weekend except for essential errands. Premier Mario Draghi's government did allow one visit to family or friends per day in residents’ home regions over the weekend, which includes the national holiday on Monday.</p><p>Italy permits religious services in the pandemic if capacity is limited and masks are worn. But early on, the predominantly Roman Catholic country’s many churches were open only for individual prayer.</p><p>Hundreds of Catholics gathered in the mammoth Cathedral of St. Paul in St. Paul, Minnesota, for the Easter Vigil service Saturday evening. Every other pew was kept empty and masks were mandatory. Still, the solemn liturgy marked a new, hopeful beginning for the congregation after a turbulent year.</p><p>After all-virtual Easter services last year, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City was at half-capacity for Sunday's Mass. Worshippers spaced themselves out in the vaulted neo-Gothic cathedral, which can seat more than 2,000. The choir sang through masks.</p><p>In Detroit, Hartford Memorial Baptist Church opened for in-person Easter services for the first time in more than a year, with capacity limits and social distancing rules in place. The Rev.

Companies are also facing challenges in ensuring the safety and security of its employees. The Human Resource department of any organisation plays a very important role in recruitment of staff, taking care of their well-being and implementing good HR practices at the workplace. In an email interview with Hindustan Times online, Seema Trikannad, Chief of Human Resources and Management Services, SBI Life Insurance, talks about the various challenges faced by them during the Pandemic and how they are trying to overcome them. She also discusses the importance of gender diversity at workplace and important traits which organizations should look for while hiring a person.</p><p><strong>How has the pandemic impacted the recruitment scenario in the insurance sector, especially at SBI Life?</strong></p><p>While the initial impact was significant, over the past year, the sector has recouped. The confidence is returning as the market is adjusting to a new working format and becoming increasingly active.</p><p>In this recovery, technology has been a major driving force, both within the insurance industry as well as in recruitment. Embracing work from home and investing significant time and energy in building a secure technological environment were the most important steps taken by all organisations for the safety and well-being of its employees and protection of data in the WFH context. Similarly, even in recruitment, we have relied heavily on technology.</p><p>The digital interventions start right from the hiring stage with the on boarding process which helps in operational ease and efficiency. Also, the induction process is a blend of both classroom and e induction model. This helps in guiding the new employees with regard to the Company’s policies and processes at a pace that they are comfortable with. We also have an HR ChatBot which is an AI powered HR chat assistant to address employee queries at the click of a button. Last year, we on boarded more than 3500 candidates ranging from entry to senior levels.</p><p>Technology is also helping in ensuring uniformity in employee experience and engagement. This year, we conducted the first ever virtual employee engagement event- our annual in house talent show- in which employees from across the country participated and which was witnessed by employees from even the remotest location. The online games, talent hunt and performances by our employees on the virtual platform helped us in keeping their spirits high even in such times.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure safety and security of employees during the pandemic?</strong></p><p>As an organisation, our core philosophy is that the safety and well-being of our employees is our priority at all times, as we do for our partners, distributors, customers etc. Providing a secure work environment, one that demonstrates emergency readiness and a strong security framework, is paramount. With increased covid cases and rising uncertainty, last year, SBI Life launched an emotive ‘WE CAN, WE WILL’ anthem, to lift the spirits at a time when the nation’s morale was at its lowest. This one of a kind initiative saw 27 local celebrities from different parts of the country singing the WE CAN, WE WILL anthem in nine different languages that was broadcast on over 30 television channels nationally. Additionally, we have constantly striven towards bettering the work environment for our employees through a number of initiatives:</p><p><strong>Steps taken by the company:</strong></p><p><strong>Embraced work from home:</strong> To contain the spread of the infection, we embraced wfh and empowered all our employees with necessary digital tools to stay connected with our customers and to address any of their immediate insurance needs</p><p><strong>Special leave on account of COVID: </strong>We introduced a special leave policy over and above the annual leave entitlement, to support our employees in this hour of need if they or their family member was infected.</p><p><strong>Isolation facilities:</strong> At the time when cases were on the rise, doctors advised the asymptomatic patients to isolate themselves in their homes, rather than the centres and take prescribed treatment. As an immediate step, we approached renowned hospitals for providing isolation rooms to Covid positive asymptomatic patients (employees) and their immediate family members so as to contain further spread of infection</p><p><strong>Consistent communication:</strong> Our leadership actively engaged with the employees ensuring constant communication and immediate solutions to any pain points brought forward by the employees.</p><p><strong>Counselling and mental health support:</strong> Mental health has also been affected to some extent just like physical health during this period. With the help of our NGO partner, we facilitated a platform where our employees could anonymously seek the required help, guidance and counselling, when felt stressed and anxious due to the ongoing situation.</p><p>While we are constantly striving to better the environment in which our employees work, we will leave no stone unturned to keep them safe and protected.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of gender diversity at the workplace, especially in the insurance sector? How do you achieve this at SBI Life?</strong></p><p>Gender inequality is a major area of concern the world over and India’s diversity only exacerbates that issue. Historically, women have been denied many opportunities because of deep-rooted biases in the social system. Over the past few decades, women’s participation in regular or high-skilled jobs has improved. Increasing economic participation of women will require priority, resource allocation, and a change in thought processes and social norms. At the organizational level, a sense of fair play should be integral to its culture. The senior management should constantly reiterate amongst the workforce the need for both genders to work synergistically and reward efforts towards the same.</p><p>Over the past three years, our employee strength has gone up from around 13,200 to 17,500 and during this period, we took consistent efforts to improve our gender mix. We have actively been recruiting women staff. This year, we are taking it a step further to run a targeted hiring plan aimed at on boarding female employees. In fact, the number of female employees in the company has gone up by 35% over the last three years. We have been consistently working towards building a more equal and inclusive organisation. Our initiatives are aimed at increasing the number of female employees so as to build a more inclusive workforce within the organisation. We also try to ensure that women have a congenial work environment and consistently appreciate and applaud efforts aimed at achieving inclusivity.</p><p><strong>What in your opinion are the most important traits that an organization should look for while hiring a person?</strong></p><p>In the process of securing top notch employees for an organisation, attracting qualified applicants is just half the battle. Organizations should focus on selecting candidates who can think out-of-the-box and fit well in the company’s culture. Some of the traits that are crucial in a hiring process are:</p><p><strong>Communication skills:</strong> The importance of effective communicators in a company environment cannot be emphasized enough. Having good communication skills, both written and oral, is essential for any employee to sustain in a team environment.</p><p><strong>Team Work:</strong> Team work contributes in an organisation’s success and development. Therefore, it is very important to hire candidates who are team players. This becomes even more relevant in the current WFH scenario, where there is a constant need for cooperation with your team members. A person who is capable of working in a team setting will enhance the productivity of the organisation by bolstering the work of others. </p><p><strong>Agility:</strong> Everywhere today, industries are facing disruptions. The pandemic has taught to be agile and ever ready for any kind of upheaval caused by external factors. Thus, having candidates who are adaptive in nature and are receptive to change is essential for every organisation.</p><p><strong>Creativity:</strong> Creativity is the essence of every successful business. Being able to think out-of-the-box is a valued trait in today’s job market. Organisations should look for versatile team members who can apply their learnings towards finding creative solutions to a business problem. Candidates with a creative thought process will always prove to be beneficial for a company in setting industry benchmarks. </p><p><strong>Proactive and independent thinking: </strong>Apart from team skills, a candidate’s ability to work on their own with nil or minimal supervision is also an important trait. Many times, companies face situations which require their employees to work proactively. In such scenarios, only people with independent thinking can lead the charge and challenge the status quo.</p><p>While I don’t downplay the importance of the traits listed above, as an HR professional, the first thing I would look for in a candidate is attitude and cultural fit. While other traits can be learned or cultivated, these two are part of a person’s nature.</p><p><strong>What in your opinion are some good HR practices? How is SBI life working to achieve and maintain them?</strong></p><p>HR plays a vital part in the success of a business and so is an important department in any organization or business. Good HR practices help in building strategic human resource management, increased employee’s engagement, improved retention in the teams and enhanced productivity.</p><p>Some of the required HR practices that every organization, small or large, should have are:</p><p><strong>Playing fair:</strong> This is easier said than done. But it is absolutely important to create and nurture a feeling among employees that their employer is fair and does not display any overt or covert biases towards any group or individual. As a corollary, you also need to have an intuition of when to follow the book and when to provide some leeway.</p><p><strong>Keeping employee’s safety and well-being in the forefront: </strong>An organisation progresses when they consider the safety and well-being of their employees as an important factor in taking any important decision. Last March, when lockdown was a fairly new word, all measures that we took were dictated by two principles- the health and safety of our employees and the security and continuance of our operations. Work from home, flexible working hours, dedicated transport facility for employees were some of the measures we adopted. Due to the distancing norms, we ensured that our buses carried only 30-40% of the regular capacity.</p><p><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion:</strong> Having a diverse workforce should be a priority for HR departments in every organisation. In the BFSI sector specifically, we have a skewed gender ratio, especially in the senior management. The efforts we put in now to improve the situation will show results 12-15 years later. Besides having the appropriate HR policies to ensure this, the senior management of the company should foster an inclusive culture and create a conducive atmosphere for gender diverse teams. Similarly, opportunities should be provided for people with special needs.</p><p><strong>Any advice you would like to give to new companies which are trying to establish themselves, and a new generation of employees?</strong></p><p>People management is a challenging task if you’re a relatively new company. You have to constantly work towards finding the best talent and fit for your company. In their initial years, new companies do not have much traction. Hence, the hiring process is very challenging. Such organisations need to leverage hybrid working models such as on-boarding freelancers. Often freelancers are keen on joining a growing organisation because of an elevated learning curve. Through this, you will save on your costs to a great extent. Also, you will get a chance to judge their performance before your hire them for a full time role.</p><p>People with risk taking abilities, who can think out of the box, are best suited to work in a new organisation because of the constant need to take crucial decisions. Thus, it’s important to look for self-starters who can work unsupervised and take charge if need be. </p>","<p>NTPC Limited has invited applications from candidates to apply for Executive and Specialist posts.

"Says both goalkeepers are happy to sit on the bench if the other gets the nod.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has welcomed the “healthy competition” for the Manchester United goalkeeping jersey between David de Gea and Dean Henderson.

Speculation has grown over the future of the 30-year-old De Gea, who has not started a match since the 0-0 draw with Chelsea on February 28.

The former Atletico Madrid star, previously the undisputed number one at Old Trafford and capped 45 times by Spain, has been linked with a move to Atletico, Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain.

“When you’re a part of Man United, there will always be players that come in and they’re not just there to fill the squad,” he said.

“David (De Gea) has had 10 fantastic years at Man United. Sergio (Romero) probably played fewer games than he deserved. Dean comes in and he wants to play. It’s a healthy competition.”

Solskjaer said both goalkeepers were happy to sit on the bench if the other got the nod.

“Every time I try to explain to players why they aren’t playing, those discussions remain private,” said the Norwegian.

“David (de Gea) has been a top keeper and is still a top keeper. I’m very comfortable playing with David or Dean and I’m pleased that either of them are happy to be a sub.”","<p>Manchester United have been handed a boost ahead of Thursday's Europa League quarter-final first leg against Granada with forward Marcus Rashford set to travel with the team after shaking off an injury.</p><p>England international Rashford, who has scored 19 goals and provided 12 assists in all competitions this season, sustained a knock in the 2-1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the Premier League and missed training on Tuesday.</p><p>Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said Rashford, 23, was available for the trip to Spain but might not be risked for the entire match.</p><p>""I can't disclose my team, we're not going to do that,"" Solskjaer told a news conference. ""Marcus is travelling and we have to make a decision tomorrow if he starts or is on the bench. I don't think he'll play 90 minutes.""</p><p>Goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who started in place of David de Gea for a seventh straight game against Brighton, is in contention to don the gloves against Granada and Solskjaer said he had to make a choice between the two on a game-by-game basis.</p><p>""I cannot prioritise the league or Europa League. The next game is the most important one,"" he said. ""David has been a top keeper and is still a top keeper. I'm comfortable playing David or Dean and pleased that either of them are happy to be a sub.""</p><p>Granada, who are ninth in La Liga, have lost their last three games in all competitions, but Solskjaer expects a stern test on Thursday.</p><p>""They're full of experience and character which you expect from teams who have been promoted recently,"" he said.

No other Spanish club has ever won five league championships in a row and, it could be argued, no other side has been as dominant as that Real Madrid team of the late 1980s.</p><p>That team was so good that it became known as the ‘Quinta del Buitre,’ the nickname of the five homegrown talents who formed the core of the side: Emilio Butragueño, Manolo Sanchís, Rafael Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza.</p><p>It all started on November 14th 1983, when journalist Julio César Iglesias published a story in Spain’s leading newspaper El País coining the term to describe the five generational talents who were poised to break into the first team. Butragueño was the pick of the bunch and his nickname, Buitre (the ‘Vulture’), stuck.</p><p>During that 1983/84 season, Real Madrid’s B team, Castilla, played some of their matches at the Santiago Bernabéu and fans would flock to the stadium to see the mercurial youngsters play. In one match, almost 80,000 packed in to watch them. Castilla actually won the second division that season, but were of course prevented from being promoted to the top tier given that they wouldn’t be allowed to play in the same division as the senior side.</p><p>The stars of Castilla were soon playing regular first division football, though. One by one they were promoted to the senior squad, and Amancio Amaro was promoted from his role as Castilla coach to take over the senior squad in time for the start of the 1984/85 campaign. That year, Real Madrid won the UEFA Cup and the short-lived League Cup. They retained the UEFA Cup and won a first LaLiga title in six years in 1986, kick-starting their period of complete dominance of Spanish football.</p><p>Funnily enough, though this quintet came through together and marked a generation, they only ever started together at senior level on one occasion: in a 1986/87 Copa del Rey semi-final game against city rivals Atlético de Madrid. Butragueño and Pardeza both played as strikers, with the former the entrenched starter and the latter usually a substitute. Pardeza moved on to Real Zaragoza in 1985, breaking the unit up, but the quintet continued to feature alongside each other in Spain squads in the late 1980s.</p><p>Butragueño remained the star of the group throughout this era, scoring 123 LaLiga goals in 341 matches. Martín Vázquez and Míchel ran the midfield, providing the ammunition for El Buitre, while Sanchis was the rock at the heart of the defence. With other stars such as Hugo Sanchez, Jorge Valdano and Juanito, the Real Madrid side of the late 1980s were nigh-on unstoppable.</p><p>Their supremacy hit a peak that few had ever seen before early in the 1987/88 LaLiga season. Real Madrid returned from their summer holidays meaning business, starting the campaign with eight wins in a row, scoring 32 and conceding just two during that run. That run got going with a 4-0 win at Cádiz and a 7-0 win at home to R. Sporting. After that, Jesús Gil, the notorious Atlético de Madrid president at the time, claimed it was a fluke and that Real Madrid wouldn’t score seven again that season. Six days later, on just the third match of the season, they thrashed Real Zaragoza 7-1, proving that they were by far the best team in the country.</p><p>While they did completely dominate for five seasons in a row domestically, the one trophy that was missing from this group’s collection was the European Cup. At a club like Real Madrid, with its 13 continental crowns, this remains a lingering disappointment. However, it’s the only blemish on the record of the ‘Quinta del Buitre.’ In fact, many older Real Madrid fans even hold that side in higher regard than some of the more recent Champions League-winning teams, because of the attractive and dominant football they produced. This really was a special team, the last team to achieve five in a row.</p>","<p>Manchester City now has the Premier League’s largest-ever wage bill, and it is set to keep on growing.</p><p>Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne secured improved terms on Wednesday with a two-year extension that contracts him to City until 2025.</p><p>The deal was announced as the club's annual report showed employee costs rose 11% in the last financial year to 351 million pounds ($485 million). City's payroll costs now eclipse those across Manchester at United, which dropped from to 284 million pounds in the same period covering the pandemic-disrupted 2019-20 season.</p><p>And the footnotes of City's finance document disclose that this season's ongoing pursuit of a quadruple, while illustrious for the club, could come with a large price.</p><p>City said that additional transfer payments, signing-on fees and loyalty bonuses will be due to players and clubs of up to 158.2 million pounds “upon the achievement of certain conditions.”</p><p>Pep Guardiola's side remains on course to produce its most successful season since the influx of cash from Abu Dhabi owner Sheikh Mansour, with his takeover in 2008 transforming City into one of England's most successful clubs.</p><p>City leads the standings by 14 points as it closes in on a third Premier League title in four seasons.

A cross from the Professional Footballers’ Association's 2020 player of the year also started the move for Phil Foden to score the winner at the Etihad Stadium.</p><p>Now De Bruyne, who has won seven trophies since joining City in 2015, is reported to be earning over 300,000 pounds a week.</p><p>“This football club is geared for success,"" the Belgium international said.

It’s my first time in India and in this club. After six months, I know the players and the club but it’s a big responsibility because this is not a local competition but an international one. It will be like a presentation of Indian football to the world. All the players have to be focused to work like a team, to be ready for 90 minutes. The most important thing is to take everything day by day. It’s not just about the first or the second game; there are six games (in 16 days), all of which are very important for us.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/working-from-home-juan-ferrando-gets-ready-for-fc-goa/story-ZsxEq1AH6HoSXjIpIVaM8O.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Working from home, Juan Ferrando gets ready for FC Goa</strong></a></p><p><strong>Does it help that you are playing at home?</strong></p><p>(It helps) when you have supporters. When the stadium is empty, you play here, at Stamford Bridge or at Old Trafford, it’s the same. Statistics show that normally teams that play at home win more but now without supporters, the balance is similar. (FC Goa skipper Edu Bedia told a media conference on Tuesday that the weather would be an advantage).</p><p><strong>In Indian Super League (ISL), FC Goa got points after trailing, but also conceded 23 goals in the league phase. How ready is the team defensively?</strong></p><p>It’s difficult but we are thinking of playing the same style. If we concede one goal, our target is to do two. Okay, I understand the big squad of the opponents and we do need to work more in defence and run more but the responsibility is not only for (goalkeepers) Dheeraj (Singh), Naveen (Kumar), (defenders) Adil (Khan), James (Donachie). It lies with everyone. If Igor (Angulo) plays as No. 9, he is our first defence. If Ishan (Pandita) plays as No. 9, he is our first defence.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your group stage opponents have a lot of experience at this level.</strong></p><p>It’s very, very difficult. They have very good players and a lot of experience in this competition. For them, it is a big moment to play in the group stage and progress to the next round. For us, it’s a great opportunity to learn, get some experience, and for our local players, to know about an international competition. It’s different—you need to focus for 90 minutes, work like a team. In ISL, you have two-three players who have good crosses, good dribbling, they can help the team; in international competitions, you need to be a team, that’s very important.</p><p><strong>Does India losing 0-6 to UAE in a friendly add to the responsibility of taking an Indian team to the Champions League?</strong></p><p>When you lose games 6-0 or 5-0 it is difficult…sometimes I talk about this as it is a big responsibility because at the moment as a club we don’t know if we are ready to participate in this competition. My focus, of course, is now to prepare the club because it is a lot of games, six games in 20 (16) days.

Of course, we will change some details. Of course, it is necessary to focus on defence, details in build-up, pressing and position in attack. But the style, more or less, will be the same because it is in our mind. We love football in this way.</p><p><strong>Going into the competition what are the areas you need to improve?</strong></p><p>It is necessary to improve more in set-pieces because we know we have a problem, but this problem (FC Goa shipped 16 goals from set-pieces in ISL, the maximum among the semi-finalists) is not because they are bad players. Sometimes it is necessary to learn when you go zone (zonal marking), when you go man to man. We have a lot of young players who don’t know about these details.</p><p><strong>You have been in India for a season. What aspects do Indian teams need to improve in?</strong></p><p>The most important thing is to focus for 90 minutes. The difference between an Asian and European team is that a European team is working for 90 minutes and they forget the extra things. Here, for example, when a referee makes a decision, some players keep thinking about that for two or three minutes. Or, for example, when you want to make a substitution, the player often needs two-three minutes to understand his role once he enters the pitch. We need to improve in these points.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/fc-goa-look-to-tackle-fixture-pile-up/story-G75Zt2UKcOyYpj0jUV9m5J.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>FC Goa look to tackle fixture pile-up</strong></a></p><p><strong>Before joining FC Goa, if someone had said you would be playing the Asian Champions League in 2021, what would you have said?</strong></p><p>When I was talking with Ravi, I never spoke about the salary.

It was a release of emotion that probably wasn’t lost on England coach Gareth Southgate.</p><p>Or Real Madrid.</p><p>Liverpool heads into its matchup with Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals with some of its key players back on song after a difficult season — among them a player who, in a way, has redefined the right-back role.</p><p>From his position out wide, Alexander-Arnold has been the most creative player on a team that has conquered Europe and, finally after 30 years, the English game over the past couple of years.</p><p>His long-range passing, his set pieces and most obviously his assists have made him arguably the world’s stand-out right back since 2018, even if his defending has been the subject of criticism on occasion.</p><p>This season, though, his level has dipped. He missed some of the condensed preseason after contracting the coronavirus and then picked up some niggly injuries. Playing in a patched-up Liverpool defense missing injured center backs Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez then Joel Matip hardly helped Alexander-Arnold during the middle part of the season as the champions’ Premier League title defense imploded and its star right back visibly struggled for confidence.</p><p>One game particularly stood out: the 1-0 loss to Southampton on Jan. 4 when Alexander-Arnold gave the ball away 38 times, a league-high for the season, before being substituted in the 77th minute.</p><p>The last couple of months have been more like the Alexander-Arnold of recent seasons, however, even if that wasn’t enough to convince Southgate to pick him in his most recent England squad — the last before Southgate must choose his 23-man group for this summer’s European Championship.</p><p>That left Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp flabbergasted.</p><p>“I am not criticizing Gareth Southgate, and I don’t want to have an argument. I respect his role and his decisions,” Klopp said. “But I know the player better than anybody else, any other coach, and I can say that he is a world-class player, and not only offensively.”</p><p>In Southgate’s opinion, Kieran Trippier, Kyle Walker and Reece James are in better form than Alexander-Arnold. To Klopp, that should not matter.</p><p>“If you compare Lionel Messi every year with his best season ever, then he is not performing now like he was performing in 2005 and 2006 maybe,” Klopp said. “But he is still the world’s best player.”</p><p>Thankfully for Liverpool, whereas Messi is 33, Alexander-Arnold is 22. The best years of his career are, in theory, ahead of him.</p><p>Indeed, England’s loss might be Liverpool’s gain in the short term. Alexander-Arnold was able to have a couple of weeks off from the intensity of competition, train hard with Liverpool, and recharge his batteries ahead of the season run-in that will see the Reds attempt to win the Champions League for the second time in three years and get back into the top four of the Premier League.</p><p>Liverpool’s right-hand side looks well-equipped to cause Madrid problems in the first leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday, with winger Mohamed Salah also scoring against Arsenal in the 3-0 win.</p><p>Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane must choose between Marcelo and Ferland Mendy at left back.

Decisive, because a win for Frankfurt would give the visitors a huge advantage over Dortmund in the clubs’ fight for Champions League qualification. Frankfurt duly grabbed a 2-1 win to leave Dortmund seven points adrift of the last qualification spot for Europe’s premier competition with seven games of the Bundesliga to play.</p><p>“I have always defended the team. But I can’t do that anymore after the performance against Eintracht Frankfurt,” chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke told the Ruhr Nachrichten newspaper a day after his team’s lackluster showing.</p><p>“In a final like this, we have to show a different attitude and give a more determined impression on the day,” Watzke continued. “Everyone has to see that we want to leave the pitch as winners and that we defend our goal with all our might. That was missing for me. It’s a question of willpower, and the team has disappointed me hugely.”</p><p>Sporting director Michael Zorc also blasted the players, saying he had “expected much more.”</p><p>The realization that Dortmund is on course to miss out on the Champions League for the first time since Jürgen Klopp’s team finished seventh in 2015 has taken hold.</p><p>“Being realistic, even with six or seven wins I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to reach fourth place. So for now that shouldn’t be our issue,” Dortmund defender Mats Hummels said after the game.</p><p>Amid speculation linking star striker Erling Haaland with a move away after just one and a half seasons in Dortmund, Hummels acknowledged that missing out on Europe’s most lucrative competition will make it harder for the club to hold onto top players and attract other exciting prospects.</p><p>“Of course the financial aspect has consequences. It can be that you can’t buy a player you want, or that you need a sell a player that you don’t want to sell,” Hummels said. “I don’t know the numbers, it’s not my area. But not reaching the Champions League would be a catastrophe from a sporting and financial point of view, and that’s what we’re close to.”</p><p>Dortmund managed to fend off a bid from Manchester United for England forward Jadon Sancho last summer. Another summer of uncertainty awaits, with Haaland likely to be the main focus this time.</p><p>Spanish media reported that the 20-year-old forward’s father Alf-Inge Haaland and agent Mino Raiola held meetings with both Barcelona and Real Madrid officials last week.</p><p>“Fake news travel quick and far,” Raiola responded in a tweet.</p><p>Haaland’s importance to Dortmund cannot be overstated. The strong Norwegian’s 21 goals in 22 Bundesliga appearances have carried the team in the league this season. He was also the decisive factor in Dortmund’s progress against Sevilla in their Champions League last-16 tie.</p><p>Haaland has scored in each of his six appearances and is the competition’s top-scorer with 10 goals. He will be keen to add to that tally against his father’s old club on Tuesday. But he cannot do it alone, and the speculation over his future is bound to have a negative impact on the team.</p><p>There’s already a feeling Haaland has outgrown Dortmund. Without Champions League soccer, Dortmund will find it harder to convince him to stay.</p><p>Dortmund defender Emre Can summed up the mood among the players after the loss to Frankfurt.</p><p>“I’m not bothered playing in the Europa League. I want to play in the Champions League,” Can said.</p><p>Dortmund’s preparations for Tuesday’s game have also been hit by injuries.

"Reigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, whose power-driving game could benefit from long rolls on many holes, says he will focus on his irons into notoriously undulating Augusta greens

Augusta National has served a warning to the world’s greatest golfers with firm and fast conditions like some have never seen ahead of Thursday’s start of the 85th Masters.

Five months after Dustin Johnson shattered the course record with a 20-under par 268 in rain-softened conditions, the Masters is back in its typical April setting and serving up lightning-fast greens with firm fairways to roll balls into danger.

“With firm greens, this golf course needs to be respected, three-time Masters winner Phil Mickelson said. “And I think it has been a long time since it has had to be respected.”

Reigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, whose power-driving game could benefit from long rolls on many holes, says he will focus on his irons into notoriously undulating Augusta greens.

Have never seen

“I’ve never seen it this fast, this quick, this early, but I certainly love the challenge,” DeChambeau said.

“We had a hole location on 17... if you just got it past the hole, it would roll off the front of the green. Literally it moves a dimple and it’s gone.”

Spain’s Sergio Garcia, the 2017 Masters winner, makes his 22nd start at Augusta National and he’s seen nothing like this.

“The greens are probably the fastest and firmest I've seen them on a Monday or Tuesday forever,” he said. “If we get lucky and the weather stays nice, it’s going to be a challenging Masters.

Impossible positions

“The way it’s playing right now, there are some holes, some pin positions... some of them are almost impossible to get to.”

Storylines abound, with Johnson trying to join Tiger Woods, Nick Faldo and Jack Nicklaus as the only back-to-back Masters winners.

“With it firm and fast, it’s just a really hard golf course,” Johnson said. “Any hole at any time can jump out and get you.”

Second-ranked Justin Thomas, who can overtake Johnson for world number one with a victory, comes off a win in last month’s Players Championship.

The 2017 PGA Championship winner has improved every year he has played. After finishing fourth in last year's COVID-19 delayed event, there’s not much room left without a green jacket.

“I know I can play this place well,” Thomas said. “I feel like it’s a place that I’m going to win at some point, at least I hope, and I feel like I can do it multiple times.”

Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy will try to complete a career Grand Slam with a Masters victory.

“Going to be a huge premium on accuracy, landing your golf ball on your numbers and being precise with your iron play,” McIlroy said. “The ball is not stopping so you’re inevitably going to miss a few greens and scrambling is going to be key, too.”","Young scores big in Hawks’ win; Lakers manage to best Raptors

A. Sharath Kamal is awaiting a final word from the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) on his proposal to have training sessions with his mixed doubles partner Manika Batra ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games.

In the background of Manika declining to join Sharath in Chennai for a camp and also staying away from the national camp held in Sonepat late last year, it remains to be seen how TTFI plans to deal with the Pune-based National champion.

Sharath, a qualifier in the Olympics singles draw as well, has engaged the services of youngsters Manush Shah and Sudhanshu Grover as sparring partners in Chennai till April 18.

Financial assistance

Meanwhile, the Mission Olympics Cell of the Sports Authority of India on Wednesday, approved financial assistance of ₹1.26 lakh (plus local transport) to Sharath for inviting Shah and Grover for 21 days to Chennai. It was also decided to include Olympic qualifier Sutirtha Mukherjee in the TOPS Core team until this year’s Olympic Games.

Elaborating on his plans, Sharath said, “From April 20, I would like to focus on the preparations for mixed doubles with Manika.

“I have suggested to the TTFI to hold a preparatory camp (for the four qualifiers, including G. Sathiyan and Sutirtha).”

When asked about the possibility of sparring with left-handers in the camps, for both singles and mixed doubles, Sharath said, “I plan to add Sanil Shetty to the proposed TTFI camp. Since in our country, we don’t have left-handed women players of good playing strength, we [Sharath and Manika] will practise against male players.”

The recently-elected Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TTFI, Dhanraj Choudhary said Sonepat or Bangalore could be the venue of the preparatory camp.

“We are looking only at air-conditioned facilities to hold the camp and a decision will be taken in the TTFI Executive Board meeting within a week,” said Choudhary.","<p>Nethra Kumanan on Wednesday became the first Indian woman sailor to qualify for the Olympics after she was assured of a top-place finish in the laser radial event of the Asian Qualifiers in Oman.</p><p>The 23-year-old Kumanan has a 21-point advantage over her nearest rival, who also happens to be an Indian -- Ramya Saravanan -- in the Laser Radial Class event with one race to go on Thursday.</p><p>The Chennai-based Kumanan currently has 18 points while Saravanan has 39 on the penultimate day of competitions in Mussanah Open Championship, which is a joint Asian and African Olympic qualifying event.</p><p>In sailing, the athlete who has the least points wins the competition.</p><p>The final race on Thursday is a 20 pointer and Kumanan has already sealed it with one round to go.

Based on William Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the film follows the events in the Kuttappan family after an unfortunate incident.</p><p><br></p><p>Fahadh plays Joji, the youngest son of the Kuttappan family and he has big aspirations. However, his father feels he’s nothing but a loser. The two other sons are also controlled by their father and it’s a family powered by domineering patriarchy. But when the father suffers a stroke and is half-paralyzed, each member of the family has his/her own reason to celebrate. At the same time, the sons also feel that they will lose everything if their father recovers and survives. Joji comes up with a plan and pulls off the perfect crime but what follows snowballs into something messier.</p><p>The film, aided by Syam Pushkaran’s solid writing, beautifully explores the dynamics of a family torn apart by greed and power. Even though based on Macbeth, the story feels highly relatable, and the characters are hard to judge. Joji works effectively as a slow-burning psychological drama as much as it’s about a crime and the events that follow. It’s more of a psychological drama because you’re left to wonder what’s cooking in Joji’s mind after he commits the first crime.</p><p>The slow buildup to the crime is strongly complemented by the haunting score of Justin Varghese and the breathtaking visuals of Shyju Khalid. After committing the first crime, Joji wakes up the next morning and goes for a run and he reaches the top of a nearby mountain. When he stands at the tip of the mountain and looks down upon his house nearby, the visual is both beautiful and chilling.</p><p>Also read: <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/anushka-sharma-attempts-to-lift-virat-kohli-in-new-video-watch-her-happy-reaction-on-pulling-it-off-101617776441884.html"" target=""_blank"">Anushka Sharma attempts to lift Virat Kohli in new video, watch her happy reaction on pulling it off</a></p><p>In what’s easily one of his juiciest performances in recent times, Fahadh breathes life into Joji – a sly, sadistic character with absolutely no remorse. It’s amazing how each of his collaborations with Dileesh and Syam has only resulted in a performance that’s hard to forget. As Joji, Fahadh is unbelievably good, bringing in a very sinister presence with his performance.</p><p>The supporting cast is equally good, especially Unnimaya Prasad as Bincy, the daughter-in-law of the house. Her character is a modern-day version of lady Macbeth, and she’s equally terrifying with a calm presence.</p>",,
"Gets government nod and support of the TOPS scheme

Sania Mirza was one set away from at least a silver medal — with Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles semifinals — in the 2016 Rio Olympics. They lost to Venus Williams and Rajeev Ram and were also denied a bronze by the Czechs, Radek Stepanek and Lucie Hradecka.

After the birth of her son the 34-year-old Sania, ranked 156th in doubles, has now set the Tokyo Olympics as her main target.

When she left the WTA Tour in October 2017, Sania was ranked No. 9 in the world. Quite judiciously, Sania has preserved most of her 12 protected ranking entries to get ready for Tokyo.

She has played six tournaments on her return over the past two years. She won Hobart immediately after getting back and competed in the Australian Open. She availed of wild card entries in Doha and Dubai, conserving her protected ranking entry.

With the rules allowing her an extended period of protected ranking entry till October 2021, Sania will have the option of choosing a doubles partner for Tokyo, ranked in the top-300. A top-10 player gets direct acceptance into the doubles draw of 32, with a partner.

Considering all these facts, the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) has, in its meeting held on Wednesday, drafted Sania back into its fold with adequate government funding.

Sania was part of the TOPS scheme earlier in the current Olympic cycle, but withdrew from the scheme when she left the Tour in 2017.

Sania is busy preparing in Dubai, with India’s No. 1 singles player Ankita Raina, for the Billie Jean King Cup World Group play-off to be played against Latvia on April 16 and 17 in Jurmala.

The onus will be on the Asian Games gold medallists, Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan, to ensure a men’s doubles entry for Tokyo, so that India can field a mixed doubles team for a shot at a medal.","Divij Sharan, seeded third with Matthew Ebden of Australia, was beaten 6-1, 6-4 by Treat Huey and Frederik Nielsen in the doubles pre-quarterfinals of the €408,800 ATP tennis tournament here on Wednesday.

Other results:

€44,820 Challenger, Split, Croatia: Doubles (pre-quarterfinals): Tristan-Samuel Weissborn (Aut) & Purav Raja bt Duje Kekez & Mili Poljicak (Cro) 6-2, 6-3.

$15,000 ITF men, Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt: First round: Sasikumar Mukund bt Timo Stodder (Ger) 6-4, 7-5.","Having good results does make you confident, says the 28-year-old

From Singapore, Lucknow to Dubai, it has been a spring of hope for Yuki Bhambri, who lost two years to a knee injury.

By defeating two of the country’s best players Ramkumar Ramanathan and Prajnesh Gunneswaran in qualifying for the Dubai ATP-500 event, the 28-year-old Yuki showed that he was getting into his groove. He played well against Aljaz Bedene of Sovenia, a top-60 player, before losing in three sets.

After Singapore and before going to Dubai, Yuki had used the time to play doubles in the $15,000 event in Lucknow with Saketh Myneni and won the title.

“Having good results does make you confident,” said Yuki, who will leave for Florida to compete in two Challengers in Orlando and Tallahassee.

“I enjoy playing in the US. I am looking forward to these events as I have not been there for a long time,” said Yuki.

It has been two weeks of solid preparation for Yuki back home in the Capital, as he got to train with Saketh Myneni, Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan and Vijay Sundar Prashanth.

“Got to practice with good players, as the ITF tournament was happening here. I am looking forward to playing tournaments again,” said the wiry Yuki, who has shed a lot of weight and become more athletic.

Yuki is hoping that his body would cooperate for some robust tennis. “I have been relatively okay. Some days my knee does hurt. Am still figuring out all the exercises that need to be done consistently to make sure that I am pain free,” said Yuki.

Looking ahead, Yuki said that as the Grand Slams were nearing, he was keen to do well in the French Open and Wimbledon.","<p>Indian tennis star Sania Mirza was on Wednesday included in the government's Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), four years after she opted out of the programme.</p><p>Sania was selected in the TOPS during the 56th meeting of the Mission Olympic Cell here.</p><p>The 34-year-old multiple Grand Slam winner had opted out of the scheme when she was selected last in 2017 because of an injury breakdown which had led to a lay-off.</p><p>""Yes, Sania has been selected in the recent TOPS list,"" a Sports Authority of India source told PTI.</p><p>Sania has already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics based on her protected ranking before she took a break from the game due to pregnancy.</p><p>Sania is currently ranked 157th in the world but as per WTA rules when a player takes a lay-off from the game longer than six months on account of injuries or pregnancy, they can apply for a ""special ranking"" (also sometimes known as a ""protected ranking"").</p><p>The special ranking of a player is their world ranking after the last tournament they played and in Sania's case, it was the China Open in October 2017. She was ranked world No. 9 at that point.</p><p>So, Sania currently has a special ranking of 9th and has already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics.</p><p>The special rankings were introduced by WTA because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Sania was inactive for two years due to pregnancy and only made her return to the court last year following the birth of her son at the season-opening Hobart International WTA event.</p><p>She partnered Ukrainian Nadiia Kichenok to win the women's doubles title.</p>","<p>The next generation of men’s tennis remains a jumble of unrealized potential.</p><p>With Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer skipping the Miami Open, the tournament was expected to bring the game’s new faces into sharper focus. Instead, the outlook remains fuzzy as the clay season begins.</p><p>Sunday’s match between No. 37-ranked Hubert Hurkacz and No. 31 Jannik Sinner was the first ATP Masters 1000 final since 2003 with two players ranked outside the top 30. Hurkacz became the lowest-ranked champion in the ATP’s top-level series since 2005.</p><p>Meanwhile, for players touted as future Grand Slam champions, Miami represented an opportunity missed. Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev failed to make it even to the semifinals.</p><p>“With the Big Three absent, I think all the NextGen guys were trying their best to play their best game, to compete as hard as they can,"" Hurkacz said. “Hopefully the spectators enjoyed it.”</p><p>But what should fans make of it? Twenty-somethings have been trying to overtake the Big Three for years, and no front-runner for 2021 emerged in Miami.</p><p>Medvedev, seeded No. 1 at a Masters 1000 event for the first time, was upset in the fourth round by Roberto Bautista Agut. No. 2 Tsitsipas exited in the same round with a loss to Hurkacz.</p><p>“I felt like it was my opportunity,” Tsitsipas said. “There was more space for me to show something greater.”</p><p>No. 3 Zverev flopped worst of all, double-faulting three times on break point in a loss to No. 83-ranked Emil Ruusuvuori. No. 4 Andrey Rublev, a Russian who leads the tour with 20 wins this year, reached the semifinals before Hurkacz upset him.</p><p>This all came after Nadal and Federer withdrew before the tournament started due to injuries, while Djokovic decided to stay home in Serbia amid the pandemic.</p><p>For Hurkacz, 24, the title is by far the biggest of his career, and the first for a Polish player in a Masters 1000 event. But he won’t be among the favorites at the French Open.</p><p>In sum, no 20-something appears poised to wrest the mantle from the 30-somethings who have dominated the sport for so long. Dominic Thiem won his first major title at the U.S. Open in September, but he is just 5-4 this year and skipped Miami.</p><p>“The next generation still has to show they can beat the Big Three,” Sinner said. “The next generation is not ready yet to win against them consistently. At some point there will be the moment; I don’t know when. It can be two years or five years, I don’t know. But the moment will come.”</p><p>Perhaps Grand Slam greatness will skip a generation, and it will be someone now a teenager who supplants the Big Three. Sinner, a 19-year-old baseline basher from Italy, took a giant leap in Miami, just his third Masters 1000 event.</p><p>Also making a splash was unseeded 20-year-old American Sebastian Korda, who reached the quarterfinals before losing to Rublev. Korda, the son of former Australian Open champion Petr Korda, is widely considered the best hope to end an 18-year drought in major titles for U.S. men.</p><p>He sounds more patient than some fans.</p><p>“My parents are super big on baby steps,” Korda said. ""You can play tennis for so long if you stay healthy — for 15-plus years. Guys now are playing until 40; it’s incredible. There are a lot of years ahead of me.</p><p>“I’ll always put my head down and keep working, and hopefully one day I could achieve something like what my dad achieved.”</p><p>Korda and Sinner have considerable flair and star appeal, as do Medvedev, Tsitsipas, Zverev and Rublev.</p><p>“The future of tennis looks great, because the generation is changing,” Rublev said. “The NextGen players, they are different. They look different compared with previous ones. I think they have charisma.”</p><p>Charisma, yes, but not yet many trophies.</p><p>___</p><p>More AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports</p><p>___</p><p>Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Steve_Wine</p>","<p>Perhaps the most endearing moment of the ATP Miami Open came across the net after the quarter-final match between Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik.</p><p>""I love you, but you're not human,"" Sinner teased Bublik after beating him as the two shook hands. Bublik, walking towards the chair umpire, teased him back.</p><p>""What do you mean?"" he replied. ""You're not a human, man. You're 15 years old and you play like this!”</p><p>Bublik may have jokingly reduced Sinner's already tender age by four more years, but the point was made. Sinner is 19, but he plays like someone about to make it big on the big stage.</p><p>That the Italian is the most exciting young talent in tennis currently was reiterated at the ATP 1000 Miami Open, where he reached his maiden Masters final after beating higher seeded players in Karen Khachanov (second round) and Roberto Bautista Agut (semi-final). The 21st seed was gunning to become the youngest male champion in Miami but ran into an in-form Hubert Hurkacz on Sunday, the more experienced Polish beating Sinner 7-6(4), 6-4 for his own first Masters title at 24.</p><p>Despite not winning the trophy, Sinner shone in the marquee ATP Masters event deprived of star power this season with Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer all pulling out.</p><p>In the tournament’s 36-year history, Sinner became only the fourth teenager to reach the final. The others? Djokovic (2007), Nadal (2005) and Andre Agassi (1990).</p><p>Most everything Sinner does nowadays puts him in rarefied places: In February this year, he became the youngest man to win two ATP titles since Djokovic in 2006 after he added the ATP 250 Melbourne title to his maiden triumph in Sofia (also an ATP 250 event) last November.</p><p>Yet, it was a couple of months prior to that, at the autumnal 2020 French Open in Paris, that Sinner really gave a glimpse of why there's such a buzz around him. Ranked 75 in the world then, the 2019 Next Gen ATP Finals winner beat 7th-ranked Alexander Zverev to become the first Roland Garros debutant to enter the quarter-finals since Nadal in 2005. His last-eight opponent was the guy he emulated. For even the most seasoned of pros, going toe to toe with the Spaniard on clay is quite a tall order. But Sinner, then 18, did just that for the most part of two sets in their late-night encounter that lasted almost three hours.</p><p>The scoreline may have read 7-6(4), 6-4, 6-1 in Nadal's favour, but Sinner matched the 13-time French Open champion shot by shot from the baseline. In rallies of over nine shots through the match, the 6ft2 Italian won 33 points, four more than Nadal. That’s against a player who thrives on grinding down his rivals with a brutal baseline game. Sinner was serving for the first set and was a break up in the second before Nadal stepped up to take charge.</p><p>“For me it was difficult to pull him out of position,” Nadal said after the match. It’s usually what opponents have to say about Nadal on clay.</p><p>Nadal was stretched—arguably more than in the final against Novak Djokovic—by a teen who most experts believed wasn’t too far away from winning titles on the bigger stages of the professional tour. It didn’t take long for that prophecy to come true.</p><p>Such was the impression Sinner made on Nadal that the 20-time Grand Slam champion picked the Italian to be his training partner for the two-week quarantine ahead of this year’s Australian Open. Sinner spoke of the “big, big” lessons he learnt in those 14 days, none more important than “how to stay on court with the right mentality”.</p><p>That mentality has developed rather quickly after the age of 14, when Sinner switched to tennis full time from being a junior champion in giant slalom and joined Riccardo Piatti’s academy in Bordighera, a seaside town bordering France. His coach believes his skiing days helped develop a maturity that belies Sinner's age.</p><p>“If you ski or you make some race, you understand immediately that you need to be concentrated and if you make a mistake, you are out,” Piatti was quoted as saying by ATPtour.com. “In tennis, he was thinking that was the game. He liked tennis because he can make a mistake and then immediately come back and play again…”</p><p>It’s perhaps why one may rarely see Sinner throw a fit after a tough loss, or engage in over-the-top celebrations after a big win. The teenager's calm body language in that quarter-final against Nadal stood out as much as his all-round game and on-court movement.</p><p>On Monday, Sinner jumped to a career-high ATP ranking of world No. 23 with the Miami show, becoming only the second teen since 2010 to crack the top-25 in world rankings. After his semi-final win, he spoke about how a deep run in one week or one tournament doesn’t mean anything to him; “the road is long”, he said.</p><p>“I think it has been a good week anyway,” Sinner said on Sunday after the final defeat. “But obviously I'm not here for making finals. I'm here to win tournaments. Today was not my day, (I) accept that. But it's going back to work.”</p><p>Yes, Sinner is just 15...no...19.</p>","<p>India's Sumit Nagal bowed out in the opening round of the ATP 250 Sardegna Open, losing a hard-fought three-set match to Slovakia'sJozef Kovalik here on Tuesday.</p><p>Both world No. 136 Nagal and world No. 124 Kovalik came into main draw through qualifying rounds and the Slovak prevailed 3-6 6-1 6-3 in a contest that lasted for two hours and 13 minutes.</p><p>Nagal had earlier won both his qualifying round games in straight sets.</p><p>He won 6-2, 6-1 against Frenchman Maxime Janvier in the second round of qualifiers to make it to the main draw.</p><p>Prior to that, he defeated local player Andrea Pellegrino 6-3, 6-4 in the first qualifying round.</p>"

"<p>Debutant writer-director Madone Ashwin’s Mandela, which premiered on Netflix on Monday, is a political satire that’s both entertaining and extremely impactful, especially in the ways it addresses issues such as caste-based politics. The film makes one realize the importance of a single vote, and why it’s essential to understanding modern-day politics in Tamil Nadu.</p><p>Set in a small village, the film follows events leading up to a local body election, and how two half-brothers won’t stop at anything to win. The village is divided by two prominent caste groups which are led by the brothers. </p><p>Watch the Mandela trailer here</p><p><br></p><p>Yogi Babu plays Mandela, a barber who doesn’t belong to either of the groups and is considered an outcast. He cleans toilets and does all sorts of menial jobs. But when it is learnt that it’s his single vote that will decide who will win the elections, he becomes the centre of attention. From an outcast, he ends up becoming the most important person in the village and his fortune changes overnight.</p><p>You could take this story and set it in any small village in India and the message will still resonate strongly. One of the prime reasons why the film works effectively and mostly stays relevant is because of its comical treatment. Yet, it does strike quite a few emotional chords without getting overly sentimental. Another reason Yogi Babu and his earnest performance. Mostly used to play silly comical characters in films, Mandela allows Yogi Babu to truly showcase his potential and he plays the titular character with so much sincerity.</p><p>First-timer Ashwin’s writing deserves a lot of praise. Without ever making a mockery of the caste-politics, he deals with the issue with a lot of maturity. His understanding of how the oppressed are seen and treated as per everybody’s convenience is on point, and it never goes overboard in its representation. </p><p>The film feels slightly long-drawn in the second half but the way it ends leaves a strong impact. It gives us a front row seat to the times we live in, and it works like a charm. If there’s one film you need to watch before you cast your next vote, this is it.</p><p><strong>Mandela</strong></p><p><strong>Director</strong>: Madone Ashwin</p><p><strong>Cast</strong>: Yogi Babu, Kanna Ravi, Sheela and GM Sundar</p>","<p>Tamil actor <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/entertainment/tamil-cinema/master-movie-review-vijay-delivers-a-largely-entertaining-star-vehicle-101610526080773.html"" target=""_blank"">Vijay</a>, who was recently seen in Master, on Tuesday rode a bicycle to the polling booth to cast his vote as part of the Tamil Nadu assembly elections.

In Purnea University, however, Pro-V-C RS Yadav is the acting V-C. </p><p>The vacancies at the top are likely to affect Bihar’s quest for certification of its colleges by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). NAAC has already set 2022 deadline for certification of all colleges in the country.

Once these units are established, the park will have <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>300 crore of additional investment. This means that the mega food park will have an investment of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>400 crore ( <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>103 crore from Centre and state and remaining through investments) and it will generate opportunity for 5000 people.”</p><p>The proposal to develop the park was prepared by BIADA under the guidance of chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar and it will be developed in 78 acres. “The total cost is <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>103 crore, in which <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>50 crore will be provided by the Centre,” said Hussain. “This food park will definitely generate employment opportunities and go a long way in opening the doors for industrialization.

Out of this, 19 MFPs are operational. As per the scheme guidelines, each fully operational food park will provide direct/indirect employment to about 5000 persons. </p><p>The scheme has the primary objective of providing modern infrastructure facilities for the food processing along the value chain from the farm to the market. It will include creation of infrastructure near farm (i.e. collection centres and primary processing centres), transportation, logistics and centralised processing centres etc. This will have an impact on increased realization of farmers, reduction in wastage and creation of an efficient supply chain backed by collection centres, primary processing centres and logistic infrastructure.</p>","<p>Bihar has been witnessing a spike in the number of daily Covid-19 infections in the past few weeks.

Nearly 800-1000 Covid-19 positive cases are being reported in Bihar after the resurgence of the disease in the past few days. </p><p>Citing the recent study on factors for ambient air pollution, Ghosh said that neighbourhood or outside boundary sources were the major contributors for deterioration in AQI in Patna. “Domestic pollution, which is mainly caused due to biomass burning, is another major issue that the government should step in to address,” added the chairman. </p><p>He said department of transport and industries were no longer contributing to the worsening AQI. “The Board has embarked up on a major drive to install state of the art air quality monitoring stations across the state to know the source of pollutants and take corrective steps to check them at the source,” said Ghosh. </p><p>Chief executive officer of the Centre for Environment and Energy Development (CEED) Ramapati Kumar said that the prevailing scenario necessitated framing of city-based micro level planning to ensure smooth implementation of the clean air action plan. “The district level officers should be sensitised about strategy and implementation process of the plan. Apart from this, the government shall act on achieving low-hanging fruits such as replacing solid fuel with cleaner sources,” said Kumar. </p><p>After strengthening the network to monitor AQI in Patna, the BSPCB has initiated steps to install air quality monitoring stations in 24 districts, besides Patna, Gaya, Muzaffarpur and Vaishali, this year. The board earlier proposed to set up air quality monitoring stations in all 38 districts, but availability of fund from both the Centre and the state government, restricted the plan to 24 districts of Valmikinagar, Siwan, Chapra, Buxar, Ara, Sasaram, Motihari, Bettiah, Muzaffapur, Aurangabad, Gaya, Rajgir, Begusarai, Bihar Sharif, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Muger, Saharsa, Bhagalpur, Katihar, Purnia, Araria and Kishanganj. </p>","<p>In another setback to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), its only member of legislative assembly in Bihar, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the Janata Dal United JD(U) on Tuesday in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Earlier in February, the party’s only member of legislative council (MLC), Nutan Singh joined the BJP. Now, the LJP has no representation left in the state legislature. </p><p>Raj Kumar Singh, an MLA from Matihani constituency in Begusarai district, was served a show cause notice by the LJP last month for voting in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for the post of deputy Speaker. </p><p>The switch comes in the backdrop of the assembly campaign in the run up to November 2020 assembly elections, which saw the LJP continuously target the JD(U) and chief minister Nitish Kumar, while being friendly to the BJP, which was in alliance with the JD(U) in the state. Though the LJP only won a single seat, the party’s 143 candidates badly hurt JD(U) candidates’ prospects on many seats, analysts say. </p><p>Chirag Paswan-led LJP has seen heavy defection with over 200 party leaders and office bearers joining the JD(U) recently. Singh first sparked speculations of jumping the ship to the JD(U), following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister last month.</p><p>The LJP was founded in the year 2000 by former Union minister and Dalit icon Ram Vilas Paswan, who died on October 8, 2020 ahead of assembly elections in Bihar. Under senior Paswan, the party won 29 assembly seats in the 2005 Bihar assembly polls and emerged as a major force in the state. However, it saw a continuous decline ever since as its number of MLAs came down to 10 a few months later in 2006, when elections were held again in the state. In 2010 elections, the party could only win 3 seats. Later, in 2014 general elections, it won 6 of the 7 Lok Sabha seats it contested in alliance with the BJP. However, in assembly elections held a year later, it could only win two seats. </p>"

However, the roads leading from Rajiv Chowk and Mayfield Gardens, running north to south, have four lanes, with a right-of-way ranging from 30-36 metres. Due to the differences in the width of carriageways, the junction is not aligned. As a result, it takes more time for motorists travelling from Subhash Chowk and Huda City Centre to cross the junction, leading to congestion and snarls.</p><p>The GMDA official cited above said that the flyover will help commuters to avoid the traffic signal at the Bakhtawar Chowk. “At present, commuters have to stop at Subhash Chowk and then again at Bakhtawar Chowk, but with the flyover, commuters will be able to avoid one signal and go straight. The flyover will be double lane and so, movement will be easy both up and down,” the official said. </p><p>The cost of construction has been estimated at over <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>60 crore and construction will start soon after approval. Officials said that the flyover should be functional by April 2022. </p><p>Along with the flyover, work will also be undertaken to develop service lanes under the flyover and making left turns free at the intersection. </p><p>For easing traffic congestion, the GMDA has already installed a smart traffic signal at Bakhtawar Chowk along with six other places in the city. A smart traffic signal is an automated one that takes into account the volume of traffic on a realtime basis. </p><p>Officials will also put forth a proposal for extending GMDA’s coverage to the entirety of the Gurugram district in the meeting.

However, the RTA could not provide information on the number of e-rickshaws currently operational in the city.</p><p>“The commuters will not be hit by this decision as we are not only phasing out diesel auto-rickshaws but also replacing them with e-rickshaws so that last-mile connectivity is not affected,” Yadav said.</p><p>However, experts expressed concern over diminishing last-mile connectivity options, as the city is heavily reliant on the shared diesel auto-rickshaws, which are easily accessible and cost comparatively much less than cab services or private auto-rickshaws.</p><p>Sewa Ram, head of the department of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) in Delhi, said that it is a good decision to introduce e-rickshaws provided they are integrated with the bus connectivity so that people do not have to bargain and pay digitally once they step out of the bus.</p><p>“The department has to ensure the last-mile connectivity is in place and the fares are fixed. The facility should be from point to point so that the drivers cannot deny passengers any route. There should be two models, one which is driven at a fixed speed and only four people can board, and another where speed is not a constrain,” he said.</p><p>He said that e-rickshaw rides will cost commuters more than diesel auto-rickshaw rides, as an e-rickshaw can only accommodate four passengers, compared to eight in diesel auto-rickshaws. Also, there will be problems if e-rickshaw drivers refuse long commutes and that the onus is on the authorities to ensure this does not happen.</p><p>Officials familiar with the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar will inaugurate the e-rickshaws on April 9 in the city.</p><p>“The process of registration and driving licence for these e-rickshaws will be done on priority at the RTA office. We will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates within 72 hours of applying. Charging stations have already been set up and more will be put up according to the rising demand. We are helping drivers with the chief minister’s subsidy and MCG subsidy along with <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>12,000 from scrap. Finance schemes have been worked out so that drivers hardly need to pay any extra amount,” Yadav said.</p><p>Yadav said that more than 100 charging stations have been set up in Udyog Vihar, South City and Golf Course Road.</p><p>Palash Roy Chowdhury, co-founder, chairman and managing director of SmartE, an e-rickshaw manufacturer that has tied up with the RTA, said, “The project will provide safe, convenient and affordable last-mile services to citizens of the Millennium City while increasing the daily earning of the drivers. Plus, it will save tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions.”</p><p>Chowdhury said that an electric vehicle will cost nearly <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1.75 lakh, including registration cost. He said that a finance scheme was worked out, wherein a driver can <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>400- <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>450 per day.</p><p>Auto-rickshaw drivers, however, were unhappy with the move and said they will not invest in e-rickshaws as they are not confident that the department will set up enough charging stations. They alleged that auto-rickshaw stands that were promised long ago are yet to be created and that the move is an eyewash.</p><p>Yogesh Sharma, the state general secretary of the Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, said e-rickshaws are not a feasible option as they are not suitable for long distances. “This e-rickshaw will be used for a short distance and if any passenger wants to go to Manesar, it will take more than three hours in these rickshaws,” he said, adding that they are not supporting this initiative and it is not welcomed by the drivers.</p>","<p> The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), in a bid to check pollution levels and phase out diesel vehicles, will introduce 2,000 e-rickshaws in Gurugram, officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, even as the road transport authority (RTA) announced an initiative to replace banned diesel auto-rickshaws older than 10 years with e-rickshaws.</p><p>The MCG’s executive engineer, Devender Bhadana, said that the civic body will hold a meeting with diesel autorickshaw owners and drivers at the John Hall in Civil Lines on Wednesday. They will be sensitised about the environmental harms caused by operating diesel auto-rickshaws and will be explained the MCG’s policy, including monetary aids, for switching to e-rickshaws.</p><p>MCG officials said that traffic police and RTA officials will also attend the meeting. “The main purpose of the meeting is for generating awareness among diesel auto-rickshaw owners and drivers. The MCG will explain to them the environmental damages caused through running auto-rickshaws on diesel and the long-term economic benefits of e-rickshaws due to considerable lower running and maintenance costs,” said Bhadana.</p><p>Bhadana said that the MCG will be providing a grant of around <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>50,000 to diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners, while around <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>30,000 will be given as scrap costs, provided the diesel auto-rickshaw is scrapped by an agency authorised by the Haryana government.</p><p>“The purchaser concerned can procure any e-rickshaw of their choice. We are aiming to launch all 2,000 e-rickshaws within the next three months,” said Bhadana, adding that the RTA will provide e-rickshaw owners registration certificates (RC) within 72 hours of applying.</p><p>Bhadana said that the MCG will be the regulatory body for all the 2,000 e-rickshaws and will also determine a fixed fare, based on point-to-point distances.</p><p>Bhadana said that the MCG has also finalised a contractor for assisting diesel auto-rickshaw drivers and owners with all the necessary documentation to procure loans for purchasing e-rickshaws.</p><p>In September last year, HT had reported that the MCG floated a tender to select a contractor for this task and that the civic body is looking to introduce 2,000 new e-rickshaws in the city. MCG officials said that the 2,000 e-rickshaws are being launched in the first phase of the project and once the conversion figure is attained, they will roll out 5,000 more e-rickshaws.</p><p>In September 2016, the then MCG additional commissioner, Amit Khatri, came up with a plan of launching 1,000 app-based e-rickshaws in the city along with an app-based company for last-mile connectivity to residents from areas located near rapid metro stations.This plan, however, never came to fruition, and the same company launched 500 e-rickshaws a year later at stations of the Delhi Metro in the city.</p><p>MCG officials privy to the matter said that Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar may also launch a batch of new e-rickshaws in the city on Friday, as the RTA seeks to replace banned autos with e-rickshaws.</p>","<p> A 35-year-old man was arrested for allegedly bludgeoning his brother-in-law to death with a grinding stone in Sector 47 on March 27. </p><p>The suspect, identified as Jahrul alias Chhotu of West Bengal, worked as a construction supervisor and lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 46.

His brother-in-law also refused to intervene and even stopped talking to him.</p><p>Sangwan said on March 27, Chhotu called his brother-in-law for drinks at a ground in Sector 47. After a few drinks, the suspect questioned him about his wife, only to be allegedly told that she wouldn’t come to back to him or return his money.</p><p>“The victim had told the suspect that his sister had spent nearly <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1 lakh and given him his share of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1.25 lakh. He also made fun of the suspect and said he deserved to live without his wife and money as he often fought with her. The deceased started laughing, following which the suspect got furious. He picked up a grinding stone lying near the spot and smashed his face and head repeatedly,” said Sangwan. </p><p>He then allegedly hid the stone near the spot and fled from the ground. “Fearing police action, Chhotu did not return to his rented room and was living at different areas,” said Sangwan. </p><p>A driver who used to park his car in the ground informed police control room that a body was lying in a pool of blood, following which a team reached the spot and found a mobile phone ringing at the spot.

"DC tells officials to draw up plans

Consequent to back-to-back floods and landslides that affected Kodagu in recent years, the district administration there is bracing ahead of time for any eventuality during monsoon.

At a review meeting held in Madikeri, the Deputy Commissioner Charulatha Somal directed the officials to prepare for any contigency that may arise due to floods after the arrival of the south west monsoon in June.

The Deputy Commissioner said there were heavy rains in the month of August in 2018, 2019 and 2020 which caused widespread damage including landslides resulting in loss of life and property. Hence vulnerable places prone to such incidents should be identified and precautionary measures should be in place.

She stressed upon the imperatives of information gathering pertaining to weather and timely dissemination to the public so that they could also be forewarned of any impending eventuality. The Agriculture Department was vested with the task of collating all information pertaining to weather and sharing it with the district administration. She said advance information pertaining to weather conditions could help prevent or minimise damage.

Calling for preparations at the taluk and hobli levels Ms.Charulatha Somal and directed the local officials to conduct review meetings to assess their level of preparations to handle any exigency. A task force will also be constituted to oversee the preparations to handle any natural disasters and it will comprise all officials drawn from various departments including Revenue, NDRF, SDRF, Fire Force, Police, CESC, Forest, and PWD. She also called upon the staff to prepare a list of safety and rescue equipment that will be required to handle any natural disaster and submit the same to the district administration within 10 days.","The number of COVID-19 cases reported in Hassan district crossed 30,000 on Wednesday.

The indefinite strike by the employees of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) that began here on Wednesday was total as none of the buses operated by the two divisions (urban and rural) hit the road.

Nearly 545 buses belonging to the rural division and about 450-500 buses of the urban division stayed put in the depots.

Private buses and other private transport vehicles came to the rescue of passengers as they ferried them to their destinations early this morning from the KSRTC’s mofussil bus terminus. The private bus operators were authorised to operate on several routes, including Bengaluru, Madikeri and Hassan, to deal with the inconvenience caused to passengers and ease the situation though not fully.

Unlike the previous strike, the Transport Department appeared to have been prepared fully to handle the situation as the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) had talks with the private operators in advance and arranged alternative modes of transport.

Besides private buses, mini-buses and tourist vehicles were also operated. However, there were no services on long-distance routes. The services of the RTCs of Kerala and Tamil Nadu on certain routes came in handy.

However, the intra-city operations were badly hit with nearly 450-500 buses operated on the routes across Mysuru keeping off the road. The city bus-stand was wearing a deserted look. The local commuters picked auto-rickshaws and taxis to reach their destinations.

Not all were aware of the strike as many were found waiting for buses in the early hours of Wednesday at the mofussil bus terminus.

Unable to get buses, the passengers were expressing their ire at the corporation for causing hardship to the public at a time when the State was in the grip of COVID-19 crisis.

Sources in the KSRTC here said employees did not report to their respective depots with all of them joining the strike unmindful of the government’s appeal to reconsider their decision in view of COVID-19 crisis.

From the Mysuru rural division, nearly 5,000 trips operated daily, with over 1,000 trips to Bengaluru alone, had to be cancelled.

“Services normally start daily from 4 a.m. but we could not operate even one bus as no driver and conductor reported for duty,” a senior KSRTC official said.

Many police personnel had been deployed at the bus terminus to deal with any untoward incidents triggering from the strike.

KSRTC Divisional Controller (Rural division) K.H. Srinivas told The Hindu that the alternative transport arrangements made by the RTOs will continue from the mofussil bus terminus.

Complaint

Some commuters complained of private transport operators charging twice the normal fare citing various reasons, including rising fuel prices and insurance premium.

In Kodagu, Chamarajanagar and Mandya, private operators pitched in to ferry commuters with the district administrations permitting their operations on several routes.","They caught two women red-handed while handing over a month-old baby to undercover women police personnel

While probing the theft of a newborn from a BBMP maternity hospital in Chamrajpete an hour after its birth in May 2020, a police team uncovered an inter-State child trafficking racket. Two women, who are allegedly part of the racket, were arrested on Monday.

The accused, Devi Shanmugam from Wilson Garden and Ranjana Devidas from Hongasandra, were caught red-handed while handing over a month-old baby, Kajol, to undercover women police personnel.

Sub-Inspector Srinivasa K.R. from Talaghatapura, who led the operation that busted the gang, said they had been alerted that the women were selling a baby girl. An undercover team approached Devi seeking to buy the child. Devi reportedly claimed that she could get them a child from Mumbai for a price of ₹3 lakh. She asked them to come to Majestic railway station with the cash on Monday.

The police filled the bag with currency notes and old newspaper bundles. When they met Devi at the station, she asked them to wait for a few minutes. Soon, a couple walked towards them and handed over the baby.

Srinivas and his team immediately caught the couple, Shankar Damodar Nayar and his wife Sunitha Nayar. “They hail from Airoli in Thane and work as labourers. They claimed to have three children, and Kajol was their fourth child. They were living in poverty. Ranjana approached them with an offer. She promised them money if they gave her Kajol. She promised them that the baby would be taken in by a rich couple in Bengaluru and had a bright future ahead of her,” said Srinivas. Ranjana convinced the couple and brought them to the city to hand over Kajol to Devi.

Sunitha and Kajol are currently at the State Home for Women while her husband has returned to take care of their other children. “They are victims, too, and will be counselled,” said the police.

Devi and Ranjana have been taken into 10 days’ custody for further investigation.

“The probe revealed that the duo have been running this racket for some time and have sold many children. They also arranged for women from Mumbai as surrogate mothers. We are questioning them to ascertain the extent of this racket,” Srinivas said.

The police are yet to find the newborn stolen from the hospital at Chamrajpete.","The Indian Railways Infrastructure Providers Association has urged the new General Manager of South Western Railway Gajanan Mallya to clear the payment of bills for various railway projects that have been kept pending since long and he has responded positively.

The police on Wednesday arrested a 26-year-old woman for allegedly killing her three-year-old daughter and dumping the body at a construction site in Annapoorneshwari Nagar. According to the police, the accused, Sudha, was angry with her daughter, Vinutha, for always taking her father’s side. She pretended her daughter was missing and joined her husband Eeranna in searching for her.

When Eeranna couldn’t locate her, he filed a missing person complaint on Tuesday with the Jnanabharathi police.

Sanjeev Patil, Deputy Commissioner of Police (West), said that the couple along with their daughter lived in a rented house at Mallathalli. While Eeranna worked at a private firm, Sudha was part of the housekeeping staff at a granite shop and worked there from 9 a.m. to noon. She would often take her daughter to her workplace.

On Tuesday, after picking up his wife and daughter from the granite store, Eeranna switched on the television to watch the news. When Sudha objected, Vinutha told her not fight with her father.

Enraged, Sudha allegedly took the girl out late in the evening while Eeranna was at work and murdered her. When Eeranna returned home, the door was locked. He called his wife on her mobile phone. She informed that Vinutha went missing while she was buying snacks for them at the chaat shop.

Worried Eeranna and Sudha, along with a friend, searched for the girl before filing a complaint with the Jnanabharathi police. On Wednesday morning, the Annapoorneshwari Nagar police found the body at the construction site. There were ligature marks on the neck.

When the police questioned the parents, they realised that something was amiss in Sudha’s statement. “She said she was in a chaat shop when her daughter went missing. However, during the course of the investigation, we found that she had not visited the chaat shop. Instead, she was placed near the area of the construction site with her daughter. We have CCTV footage of them,” said a senior police officer.

Sudha claimed that the child would always take her father’s side in any argument and would report on her movements to him. “She claimed that Vinutha often humiliated her and called her names. Enraged by this, she decided to kill her,” Mr. Patil said.

The police are trying to ascertain if there were other reasons for the murder.","<p>The Karnataka government on Wednesday issued an order banning the use of swimming pools, gyms, party halls and other such shared spaces with immediate effect in view of the rising cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), news agency ANI reported. </p><p>In wake of the Covid-19 situation in Bengaluru, restrictions under Section 144 CrPC will be imposed in the city from today, the order said.

Jain says, “We aimed to make sure that clean water is available for drinking to all the animals around us, be it domestic or wild. This, we realised, was possible by creating a network of volunteers and more awareness among the masses.”</p><p>In Bengaluru, a 25 member strong team distributes cemented pots in two sizes — small size pots for birds that are suitable to place on the terrace and balcony and large size pots for stray dogs and cows, which can be placed near the entry gate of houses. Praful Maun, one of the volunteers with this group, explains how the collective operates: “We have four modes of distribution. First, we have a collection point from where people can pick up the pots. Second, many of our volunteers conduct door to door distribution of the water pots. We then do community drives in multiple areas. And lastly, we partake in institutional or corporate drives. Our volunteers conduct camps in schools, colleges, and even police stations to create awareness on the importance of water and water pots.” </p><p>The group is presently catering to around 25 centres in Bengaluru, including Vijaynagar, Cottonpet, Hosur, Domlur, HAL Basavanagar, Ulsoor, HSR Layout and HBR Layout; each centre has volunteers investing their time and effort for the noble cause. The latest feat has been the distribution of 225 water pots at St Joseph’s College in the city. “Our mission is to make water conservation, distribution of water for strays and planting of trees a part of school curriculum,” adds Jain.</p><p>Tina P Fernandes, a Bengaluru resident who has been distributing these water pots in the city, feels elated at the response of Bangaloreans, and says, “I initially joined the group because I thought I’ll take a few pots for my area, but later I started encouraging my family and friends to keep water for the voiceless. We now have a volunteers’ group where we coordinate for the distribution of pots... Even during the lockdown last year, I distributed close to 50 water pots in a day, from Koramangala to Bannerghatta road. People came till the main road junctions to collect these pots so that they could at least ensure clean water for the stray animals and birds.” </p><p><b>Author tweets <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">@bhagat_mallika</a></b></p><p><b>Follow more stories on <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">Twitter</a></b></p>","<p>Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar on Tuesday appealed to the Union Government to provide more doses of COVID vaccines to the state in order to control the pandemic.</p><p>He also explained about the need to increase in availability of oxygen for the patients and uniform Covid guidelines across the country.</p><p>Sudhakar on Tuesday participated in the Union Health Minister's VC with the Health Ministers of 11 states/Union territories.</p><p>The Minister explained the measures taken in the state including speeding up of testing to control the second wave in the state, his office said in a release.</p><p>Speaking on the Covid guidelines, Sudhakar insisted that there should be uniform guidelines across the country regarding cinema halls, inter-state travel, meetings and other public gatherings.</p><p>This will help in more clearer instructions and easy to follow.</p><p>Therefore, all affected states should have a uniform guidelines to make people aware of the seriousness of the situation, he said.</p>","<p>Covid-19 cases continue to spike in Karnataka as the state reported yet another record high of over 6,000 cases on Tuesday, the highest this year.

"With election over, pace expected to pick up

Though the State has begun an aggressive vaccination campaign against COVID-19, trying to vaccinate as many people as possible in the 45 years plus age group in the next 45 days, the lukewarm response is raising concerns.

While the response in districts such as Thiruvananthapuram, which has been administering over 20,000 doses a day, is encouraging, some vaccine hesitancy and lack of trust in the new vaccines are in evidence in Idukki, Malappuram, and Kasaragod, officials said.

When vaccination was opened up for the 60 plus age group on March 1, the response had been phenomenal, with people thronging the sites. “We expected a similar response when vaccinations were opened up for all above 45 years on April 1. But there is no urgency amongst people though cases are climbing,” an official said.

However, some district health administrations said the lukewarm response last week was because of the polls. With the election over, vaccination would pick up. “There is no crowding because it has now been made available right from primary health centres upwards and in a lot more private hospitals,” a district official said.

“We need the whole-hearted involvement of LSGI officials to take vaccination ahead. All of last week, they were involved in the poll affairs. And people were reluctant to take the shots fearing that they might be laid up with fever or other side-effects and miss participating in the election activities. We hope vaccination will pick up pace in a week,” K. Sakeena, district medical officer, Malappuram, said.

Media reports about even vaccinated people getting COVID infection have created confusion among the public and some sceptical questions on why one should get vaccinated if it is not to free people from a restricted life are questions health officials are facing in the field.

For the public, weary of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, messages that they should continue to wear mask regardless of their vaccination status have been quite confusing.

“The messages on how vaccines can change the course of the pandemic and what should be expected after vaccination should be conveyed more lucidly to people. No vaccine gives an assurance that it can prevent all infections. But all vaccines give 100% assurance against serious disease, hospitalisation, and death. There have been very few infections in people who completed at least three weeks after their first vaccine dose. Though a few infections were reported in fully vaccinated healthcare workers, these were all mild and asymptomatic infections,” a health expert said.

The pandemic could be prolonged if people refuse to get vaccinate. If vaccination pace does not pick up and reach at least 70 % of the population, disease transmission may not reduce and will lead to the emergence of more mutant variants.

‘Less infectious’

Scientists still do not know for sure if a vaccinated person can transmit infection to others. But there are research studies which suggest that even if a vaccinated person contracts COVID-19, he may be less infectious.

A research study from Israel reported that people who had been administered Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and who contracted COVID afterwards, had lower viral loads than unvaccinated people who caught the infection.

Lower viral load indicates that the person is less contagious and with sufficient coverage in the population, vaccination can reduce transmission, it is hoped.","LDF sees no anti-incumbency, UDF senses political drift in its favour

The emergence of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as a third force in Kerala politics appeared to have introduced an element of unpredictability into the post-poll calculations of the United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF).

Congress and Communist Party of India(Marxist) campaign managers strived to read the runes in 140 constituencies on Wednesday. The BJP factor loomed in the background.

The LDF sought reassurance in the estimation that the government did not face an enfeebling anti-incumbency factor. The ruling front believed that its governance record and manifesto moored to welfarism and development had improved its chances for a second consecutive term in power.

However, the LDF seemed unsure how the Nair Service Society’s poll day spotlighting of the Sabarimala issue would impact Hindu voters.

By some accounts, the LDF hoped to retain most of its seats in Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur districts. It expected to increase its tally in Thiruvananthapuram and defeat the BJP in Nemom.

The coalition has put much stock in the Kerala Congress (M) to make gains in Kottayam and Idukki. It believed the “apolitical” Twenty20 collective would eat into UDF votes in Ernakulam.

The LDF hoped to dominate the Malabar region and foray into the Indian Union Muslim League bastions in Malappuram.

Like the LDF, the UDF also hoped to win a ruling majority with a clear margin. It has sensed a political drift in its favour. Sabarimala had billowed its sails. The LDF’s alleged attempt to open the seas to foreign trawlers had manifested as a powerful headwind. Rahul Gandhi’s campaigning would tip the balance in favour of the UDF.

The Congress has tried hard to make a comeback in Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur. It expected a surge in its popularity in Kozhikode, Kottayam, and Idukki.

The BJP has narrowed down its victory chances to less than five constituencies. However, it felt it had emerged as a decisive third force and made significant inroads into the Christian community’s electoral bastions in central and southern Kerala.

The National Democratic Alliance has high hopes for Nemom, Kazhakuttam, Konni, Malampuzha, and Manjeswaram.

At least two pre-poll surveys had accorded an electoral advantage to the LDF. However, the the UDF and the BJP had rubbished the opinion polls.","Part payment of ₹1,978.96 cr. for land acquisition

Kerala has given another ₹585.53 crore to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as its 25% share against the expenditure incurred for land acquisition for six-laning of National Highway 66 from Kasaragod to Kazhakuttam in the capital.

The amount has been made available to the NHAI from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) that has been authorised to provide the funds for meeting the 25% cost of land acquisition.

The amount has been transferred to the NHAI on the basis of a letter from the Regional Officer, NHAI, on March 18 seeking ₹585,53,04,650 as part payment towards the 25% cost of land acquisition as per a tripartite agreement reached between the NHAI Principal Secretary, PWD, and the Chief Executive Officer, KIIFB, official sources told The Hindu.

As per the pact inked to overcome the rising cost of land acquisition and expedite the six-laning of the NH 66 corridor from Thalapadi on the Kerala-Karnataka border in Kasaragod to Kazhakuttam, the State has to give ₹1,978.96 crore to the NHAI. The State has given ₹604.90 crore and ₹525.70 crore — in three tranches — to the NHAI already in addition to the ₹585.53 crore now.

The NHAI had recently awarded the works for six-laning of 39 km from Thalappadi to Chengala to the Uralungal Labor Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) paving the way for the commencement of the much delayed NH development. The ULCCS had bagged the works for the first stretch from the State border for ₹1,704.125 crore.

The tender process for 11 stretches from Thalapadi to Kodungalloor and three stretches from Paravur in Alappuzha to Kadampattukonam in the State capital for the six-laning of NH 66 are on.","The victim was sexually assaulted

A police team probing the alleged murder of a five-year-old girl by her stepfather has confirmed sexual assault of the victim.

Officials said the preliminary post-mortem examination report attributed the death to multiple injuries on head, chest, and stomach caused by a knife. “She was also subjected to sexual assault and we have registered a case against her stepfather under IPC Section 302 [punishment for murder], Protection of Children from Sexual Offences [POCSO] Act, and the Juvenile Justice Act,” an official said.

The accused was produced before the Konni Judicial First-Class Magistrate Court and remanded in custody.

The girl, daughter of a couple based in Tamil Nadu, was found dead at their rented home near Kumbazha recently. Alex, the stepfather of the victim, was arrested.

Escaped from station

The accused had made a couple of attempts to flee custody and even escaped from police station once. Police, however, could apprehend him during a search operation.

A police officer has been suspended in connection with the incident.","KPCC working president K. Sudhakaran has demanded re-polling in the Taliparamba constituency, where he said, the CPI(M) had captured booths and indulged in violence.

Speaking to mediapersons here on Tuesday, Mr. Sudhakaran said that the UDF was demanding re-polling after considering the fact that polling had not taken place in many panchayats in a fair manner.

The Taliparamba UDF candidate, P.V. Abdul Rashid, had written to the Election Commission demanding re-polling in the constituency, he said.

Mr. Sudhakaran said that while there was booth capturing and violence in Taliparamba, there was widespread use of fraudulent votes in Dharmadam where the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was contesting.

He said the CPI(M) had captured all the booths in Malappattam and Pariyaram panchayats in Taliparamba constituency.

He accused LDF candidate M.V. Govindan of instigating the capture of booths in Taliparamba. He said the presiding officers had colluded in carrying out such bogus voting.

In Dharmadam, a large number of people were denied the right to vote, he said.","The active COVID-19 caseload in Kozhikode district has been steadily going up in the past few weeks after registering a decline some time ago.

A 20% government rebate is available for handloom products. A coupon will be provided for every purchase above ₹1,000 and the mega prize is a washing machine.

The expo will be open from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. until April 13, a press release said.

The Karali showroom at Muthalakkulam, a unit of Handicrafts Development Corporation of Kerala, is hosting Vishu Expo till April 13 from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. The expo features an exclusive collection of Aranmula metal mirrors and Krishna idols.

The expo is being held with an aim to help the craftsmen of Aranmula, who are facing a severe financial crisis in the wake of the pandemic. The mirrors will be sold at a discounted rate of 10% to 20%. Artefacts in wood, jute, brass, and other materials are also available at the expo, a press release said.","Final tally puts voting percentage in district at 74.98

A day after the polls, leaders of the three political fronts have expressed their hope of registering a resounding victory in the district.

CPI(M) district secretary P. Gagarin said that the LDF was in for a historic win in the three Assembly segments in the district. The decline in the polling would benefit the Left Democratic Front (LDF) as a huge number of United Democratic Front (UDF) voters had kept away from voting owing to internal issues in the Congress, Mr. Gagarin claimed.

In Sulthan Bathery segment, nearly 7,000 voters failed to cast their votes but the number of voters in Mananthavady and Kalpetta segments were almost equal comparing with the 2016 polls, Mr. Gagarin said.

UDF convener N.D. Appachan said that the poll verdict would be a befitting reply to rumours propagated by LDF. The anti-incumbency factor against the government was reflected in the poll, Mr. Appachan said. The active participation of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in the poll campaign would benefit the UDF, Mr. Appachan said. A slight decline in the polling percentage would not affect the UDF as borne out by the fact that the front had won the three segments even when the voting percentage had fallen to 72% a few years ago, he said.

The issues related to debt-ridden farmers, the alleged negligence of the LDF government towards the health sector, increasing man-animal conflict and the stance of the government in fixing eco-sensitive zone around sanctuaries would also be reflected in the results, he said.

BJP district president Saji Sankar said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) would reap the rewards for its hard work. The people wanted a change in the government and it would reflect in the results, he said.

According to the final tally, 74.98 % of the voters had cast their ballots in Wayanad district.

The percentage in the Kalpetta constituency was 74.34 %, in Sulthan Bathery 74.29 % and in Mananthavady 76.43 %.

In the 2016 Assembly polls, 78.01 % of voters had cast their ballots in the district. The percentage in the Kalpetta constituency was 78.48 %, in Sulthan Bathery 78.32 % and in Mananthavady 77.67%. However, the total percentage of votes declined from 78.01% to 74.98 % this time a dip of 3.03%.","The COVID-19 graph is rising in Ernakulam district too which recorded 504 new cases on Wednesday.

There were just 125 recoveries.

There were 80 new admissions to FLTCs/hospitals on Wednesday. Testing has been ramped up in the wake of a spike in cases and 11,358 samples were sent from private and public hospital laboratories in the district for testing on the day.","Effort part of green protocol in electioneering

With the din and dust of the month-long electioneering settling down, a few candidates, who were in the fray, have decided to clean up the constituencies in which they contested by removing their publicity materials.

P. T. Thomas, the UDF candidate in Thrikkakara constituency, retrieved his publicity materials from different parts of the constituency as part of the efforts to follow the green protocol in electioneering. The cleaning-up drive began at Panampilly Nagar on the day.

The UDF workers will fully remove the materials from the constituency within a fortnight, said election committee chairman Joseph Alex.

Besides taking back the boards and banners, posters pasted on the walls will also be removed, he said.

In the Kalamassery constituency, the LDF workers too removed the campaign materials. P. Rajeev, the LDF candidate, led the workers in the campaign.

In Ernakulam, the LDF candidate Shaji George Pranatha began the clean-up drive at Vaduthala. The family members of the candidate too participated in the programme.","Cricketer Robin Uthappa was presented the National Excellence Award for his remarkable contribution to the field of cricket by the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode (IIMK) here on Wednesday.

This is the third edition of the award, presented annually to eminent personalities for their contribution to the world of sports, and to commemorate the IIMK’s iconic Calicut Half Marathon which is now into its 12th year. The event, which is going completely virtual for the first time, is scheduled from April 9 to 11.

Prof. Debashis Chatterjee, Director, IIM-K, gave away the award to Mr. Uttappa. The National Excellence Award is a replica of the IIM-K’s inspirational mnemonic - the “Arise Arjuna” statue.

Presenting the award, Prof. Chatterjee recounted Mr. Uthappa’s immense contribution to cricket and how he ably carried his team forward by demonstrating resilience, focus, and determination - a quality that resonates with the legend of Arjuna. He also fondly recalled the iconic moment when Mr. Uthappa tipped his cap and saluted the crowd after hitting the stumps in.

The award was instituted two years ago, with the first recipient being Para-Olympian and Arjuna awardee Dr Deepa Malik. Ms. Babita Kumari Phogat, renowned wrestler, also an Arjuna awardee, was conferred the award last year.

Mr. Uthappa expressed his gratitude about his cricketing career and relived the days when he shared the stage with cricketers such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, and Virendra Sehwag among other Indian cricket legends.","With SSLC exams beginning today, students and parents should be more mindful about protocols

Now that the Assembly polls are over, the State will intensify COVID-19 containment measures from Thursday and focus on vaccinating as many people as fast as possible.

On Wednesday, a meeting of the core committee headed by Chief Secretary V.P. Joy said that the State needed to be more vigilant about containment, now that new cases were on the rise and a more intense second wave of COVID-19 was sweeping across other States.

The State police have been asked to enforce protocols strictly in public spaces and to ensure that none violated the mask rule. Crowding has to be avoided at all shops and public places. The sectoral magistrates would be aided by the police in enforcing the protocols.

Cases were expected to surge in Kerala too after the Assembly polls and with the SSLC examinations beginning on Thursday, students and parents needed to be more mindful about the protocols.

The meeting decided to intensify the current vaccination drive for 45 plus age group in the State in the next three days, with the active involvement of local self-government bodies. It also issued an advisory that polling officials, polling agents as well as all party workers who actively took part in the election activities to be more careful in the coming weeks and to get themselves tested immediately if at all they develop any fever or other COVID-related symptoms.

The seven-day quarantine for people coming from other States would be strictly enforced.

Students appearing for the SSLC examinations should ensure that they wear the mask at all times, on their way to the examination venue and inside the hall. They should take care not to stand together in groups with other school mates. Parents have been asked not to accompany the students.

Students should not share their stationary supplies with other students. Any student with any symptoms such as fever or respiratory illness should inform the authorities at the examination centre ahead of the examination."

Officials said that farmers in the area are accustomed to the occasional sight of leopards, especially around this time of the year. The farmers immediately altered the district forest office, who in turn roped in rescuers with Wildlife SOS, which runs a leopard rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar.</p><p>“While harvesting their sugarcane crops, local farmers stumbled upon three tiny leopard cubs huddled together amidst the tall, dense fields in Vadgaon Sahani village... The cubs were brought to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Center for a brief medical examination. Identified as two males and one female, the cubs were estimated to be about fifteen-days-old,” Wildlife SOS said in a statement.</p><p>Veterinarian Dr. Nikhil Bangar, who examined the cubs for ticks and injuries, found them to be in good health. An initial attempt to reunite the lost cubs with their mother on the weekend remained unsuccessful. However, the cubs were placed in a box and left in the same field where they were found late Monday night.</p><p>“After a long night of waiting, the mother leopard was seen slowly approaching the field at dawn. Relieved to be reunited with her cubs, the leopard quickly knocked over the box and took her precious babies away to a safer location,” said Dr Bangar. The operation was captured with a camera trap placed nearby.</p><p>Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Harvest season in Maharashtra often coincides with leopard cub season, which puts both humans and these elusive wild cats in a rather sensitive and conflicting situation. We are grateful to the villagers who took the right step by informing the Forest Department.”</p><p>Yogesh Ghodke, Range Forest Officer in charge of the area, explained that the Junnar region has a significant leopard population, which -- due to rapid loss of forest cover -- are being forced to seek safe refuge in tall, dense sugarcane fields, leading to such encounters. </p>","<p>Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to procure Rs1 crore worth of Remdesivir injections.

They had to change their profession for survival and now fresh restrictions have left them with uncertainties. </p><p>With no permission for stage shows throughout the year, artistes explored various options for financial support. </p><p>Prasad Kulkarni who is known for his magic tricks across Pune was left with no work in 2020 due to restriction on public shows. Along with colleagues, he started Kulkarni vada pav centre on Sinhgad road in May 2020. </p><p>“We sold one vada pav for one rupee during the first three days to attract customers. It worked as people started visiting our shop regularly. With people liking our quality, financially things began to fall in place for us,” said Kulkarni. </p><p>With restrictions imposed again, Kulkarni and his colleagues are in a spot, again, apprehensive about the future of their vada pav centre. </p><p>“With only the parcel system allowed, the business had definitely hit and it is the same for all eateries. We changed our profession to survive, but if this also does not allow us to earn then it will become difficult to survive,” said Kulkarni whose video online on problems faced due to the lockdown got viral. </p><p>“Actually the video was to only portray the difficulties people are facing and there was no political motive against the state government. Many people took it the wrong way and now I am getting calls asking for explanations about the video. Breaking the chain of Covid transmission is a must, but total lockdown will hurt the economic condition badly,” Kulkarni said. </p><p>Another artiste, Chaitali Majgaonkar Bhandari, who is a stand-up comedian from the city was left with zero income for seven months (March-September, 2020) before she started selling puppets online. </p><p>“Before the lockdown, I had a monthly income of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1 lakh which went to zero. From October I started to sell puppets which brought me stability. I used to conduct online shows, but it is completely different then performing in front of a live audience. </p><p>“Thing were getting normal and I did many shows between December-February. Now activities are again on halt due to the lockdown and it will make things difficult for many artistes,” said Bhandari. </p><p>“Artistes are creative people and many find ways to survive, but some will not cope with another long lockdown,” she said. </p>","<p>Pune: For the second consecutive day, on Wednesday, shops in commercial areas like Bajirao road and Camp, opened in defiance of the newly imposed strict restrictions on non-essential stores remaining closed in the city. </p><p>Several non-essential shops opened on Wednesday, and even the police were on the backfoot with no major action taken. </p><p>The Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) has given an April 9 ultimatum to the state government to allow the opening of shops, or else, on Friday, all shop owners in Pune will open their shops at 10.30 am. </p><p>A protest has been planned on Thursday, from 11 am to noon, where traders and shop owners will walk along Laxmi road, from Vijay Talkies to Quartergate chowk. </p><p>“Due to these new strict restrictions imposed by the state government, traders are very angry, not only in Pune, but across the state. A meeting was held of all the trader associations across Pune district and it was unanimously decided to protest against this injustice. All the shop owners and traders will be protesting on Laxmi road with social distancing and holding banners in hand. On Friday if the new orders are not given, then all non-essential shop owners will open up their shops from 10.30 am till 6 pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of the association. </p><p>Kiran Baheti, a shop owner on Tilak road said, “I cannot afford to keep my shop closed for even a single day, as I am paying <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>30,000 rent per month.

We protest against it.”</p>","<p>Pune: The state government’s decision to give temporary powers to the chairpersons and secretaries of housing societies to allow them to ensure that Covid patients are quarantined in their homes and do not leave the societies, has come in for some criticism. </p><p>State urban development minister Eknath Shinde, at a meeting on Tuesday, directed divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and chief executive officers of nagar panchayats and municipal councils, to implement the government order strictly, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Bombay Police Act. </p><p>However, society members allege that the temporary powers could be used to settle scores with opponents and impose unilateral decisions leading to internal fighting. </p><p>A section of the housing society office-bearers, however, have supported the move and said it would curb the surge in Covid-19 cases. </p><p>Dhananjay Patil, an resident of Kalpvriksha Housing Society in Narhe, said, “There is no society in the city where there is no clash between society residents and office-bearers. We have seen that in otherwise normal situations, there is always a game of one-upmanship between society members and office-bearers. This power might be misused by society office-bearers and hence, the decision must be rescinded.” </p><p>Sanjay Sharma, secretary, Tulips and Turnips Society in Yerawada, said, “The decision to empower the chairperson and secretary to keep Covid-19 patients indoors is welcome. It will ensure that residents don’t break the law and follow the health protocols, as it is in the interest of society.” </p><p>Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) director Sanjeev Kumar Patil said, “Currently, the residents need to be disciplined as they are violating the protocols and guidelines with impunity.” </p><p>BJP state vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “This decision to designate the society chairperson and secretary as special police officers will trigger internal conflicts.

Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return of his promise of payment of a high ransom and an annual tribute. However, this was not paid and the Yadava kingdom’s arrears to Khalji kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by Malik Kafur, accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. Their huge army conquered the weakened and defeated forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor in return for a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in South India. Ramachandra’s successor Simhana III challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri in 1313. </p><p>Simhana III was killed in the ensuing battle and Khalji’s army occupied Devagiri. Thus, the mighty Yadava Empire was completely annexed by the Khalji sultanate in 1317. </p><p>Malik Kafur conquered most parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, thus bringing the significant Deccan territory under Islamic rule.</p><p>In the year 1320s, the Tughluq Dynasty occupied the Delhi throne and shortly after in 1327, Muhammad bin Tughluq’s shifted his capital from Delhi to Deogiri.</p><p>This period was the most productive period in the work and ideology of the early Sufi Shaikhs, who also became the guiding factor for later mystics and rulers.</p><p>Propagation of the Sufi sect in Deccan was greatly supported by spread of political powers. It was around the same time, mysticism movement in Islam in the form of Sufism started growing and many Sufi saints travelled with their disciples for propagation of the sect. </p><p>The devotional mysticism of the Bhakti movement in Deccan provided an ideological overlap with the Sufism, which led to syncretic practices accepted by Dakkhanis.</p><p>Deccan provinces provided fertile grounds for development of medicine, astrology and trade, some of the primary Sufi interests. </p><p>It was during this time, Shaikh Nizamuddin Avaliya with his 700 followers descended south to propagate the Sufi sect. One of his followers, Sheikh Sallauddin Gazi Chisti, alias Sheikh Salla (son of Sheikh Abdulla of Ghor), came down to Pune with his four followers from the Middle East and settled on the banks of the river Mutha near present day Shaniwar peth. </p><p>Pune Pet Kafiyat, a Maratha period manuscript discovered by Dr Uday Kulkarni documents a rather peculiar tale related to Shaikh Sallauddin. The saint Sallauddin was camping in the Masjid gardens (now absent) near Kumbhar Ves. The Saint performed the miracle of raising the dead bullocks belonging to the grief-stricken gardener of the temple named Divekar. The delighted gardener informed the keeper of the fort Kondhana (then Sinhagad), Annaji Shirke about the astonishing miracle and invited him to visit Shaikh Avaliya. Ailing son and limbless daughter of Annaji were healed completely by Shaikh Avaliya’s touch and recitation of verses. This incident helped build the trust of locals in the immigrant group of Sufis. </p><p>Shaikh Sallauddin’s death in the year 1358 was commemorated by his followers by forcibly converting the Yadav period Narayaneshwar temple into his memorial dargah.</p><p>This dargah lies to the left of Shaniwanwada, along the river Mutha, and is popularly known as Thorla (senior) Shaikh Salla Dargah. </p><p>When the temple of Narayaneshwar was demolished, the Vedic Brahmin priest of the temple Shyambhat Rajarshi (Kulkarnis of Pune) converted to the Islamic faith and became disciples of Shaikh Salla Avaliya. He requested his teacher to grant him religious rights as per Islam and Avaliya arranged for him to be appointed as Kazi of the town of Pune. </p><p>The Kazi of Pune and Pirjadye of the Shaikh Salla dargah are the successors of Shyam Bhat. Further, Shyam Bhat was conferred Inam of Mauje Erandwane and Mauje Kalas villages for the management of the Sheikh Salla Dargah. </p><p>The main tomb, which has a plain doorway, is approached by a flight of steps. The space inside is very uneven and is now a regular burial ground with numerous graves around the central tomb, which is a circular domed room. The ruins of the original Yadava period Narayaneshwar temple are still scattered about to the south-west of Sheikh Salla’s tomb. They consist chiefly of stone columns and lintels, some in their places and others strewn over the ground. </p><p>A few years later, Sayyad Hisamuddin Kattal Zanjani (a religious advocate belonging to the sect of Makhdum Mit Ashraf Samnani), came to Pune and settled on its banks near Kumbhar Ves. </p><p>Saint Hisamuddin died in 1390. Punyeshwar Temple on the banks of Mutha near Kumbharwada was brought down and converted into the memorial dargah of Shaikh Hisamuddin. This led the fleeing of priest of Punyeshwar with the Shiv-linga to the base of Purandar fort.</p><p>Behind the mosque, a flight of steps lead from Punyeshwar’s temple to the river bed. Pillars of this temple match the pillars of Kasba Ganpati temple. In the front courtyard to the left is a tiled building where a bier or tabut is kept and where congregations are held for prayer.</p><p>The domed structure on the tomb was added later.

As the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what is known as bilateral crackles: typical sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. A Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia had set in on the third day.</p><p>“Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said that their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage.</p><p>As Mumbai grapples with a surge on account of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, doctors across the city say that CT scans of positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly turning to severe.</p><p>Given their age, the couple was an ideal candidate for hospitalisation. But they could not find a bed in a private hospital. They were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication at home and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are coming with early lung infections. During the last wave, only some of the immunocompromised patients would turn up with such early infections, he said.</p><p>Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” said Dr. Bajan, adding that the CT scans of these patients are deteriorating faster, within one or two days of admission.</p><p>A CT-scan severity score, ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection.</p><p>“I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that younger people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Bajan.</p><p>From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped exponentially to 2866 cases per day in March. The surge continues further this month with the city reporting an average of 9500 per day in the first five days. The active cases in the city have jumped by over 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5.</p><p>According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical.</p><p>“Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said physician Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said.</p><p>However, experts also said that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster.

On March 11, a serial dog rapist was arrested by the DN Nagar police for raping at least eight female dogs only after the video of the crime was submitted to the police. On March 4, a five year old community dog was beaten to death by a few locals at Chandivali, following which, an FIR was registered at the Sakinaka police station under Section 429 (mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless an animal) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) but no arrests were made, in spite of a recorded video of the violent act. On October 20, 2020, a nine year old female dog was raped, brutally injured by pushing a wooden stick in her private part and left to die near Galleria mall at Hiranandani Gardens in Powai. The police registered a case of rape and attempt to murder against an unidentified man who is still at large. </p><p>These are just a few instances reported to the police where people have acted worse than the animals during the post lockdown period - starting from April 2020. According to animal activists and NGO workers, the number of animal abuse cases has increased drastically and at an alarming rate post lockdown. </p><p>Vijay Mohnani, of the NGO Bombay Animal Rights and the Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA), said the frustration of losing jobs and inflation is also one of the reasons for incidents of animal abuse doubling in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2018. </p><p>Data collected by the NGOs reveals that in the first two months of 2021, at least 8 animal abuse cases were registered in Mumbai every day, as compared to 3 or 4 cases in 2019. Last year, despite the lockdown, 886 cases were registered, with maximum cases registered after September 2020. </p><p>Out of the 480 cases recorded in the first two months this year, 266 were accidents and hit and run cases, while the rest were brutal murders, rapes, assaults and harassment like starving the animal or death due to abandonment. </p><p>“Before the lockdown we used to get around 2 to 3 complaints of hit and run and accident cases of stray animals but after the lockdown these numbers have increased to 7 to 8 cases in a day across the city,” said Mohnani. </p><p>Police and activists say some men consider it a sport to harm and abuse defenceless animals by beating, kicking, torturing, throwing acid or boiling water, amputating part of the body, attacking with a knife or a blunt object. </p><p>Lata Parmar, Mumbai unit head of the People For Animals (PFA) said since the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) doesn’t keep animal violence data, it becomes difficult for the government and police to gauge the problem. “This data is collected by the reports that reach us but there are so many cases that go unreported,” said Parmar. </p><p>BJP Member of Parliament and animal rights activist, Maneka Gandhi, who was also the chairperson of PFA, advocated for stricter punishment and penalties for offenders. </p><p>Parmar said insensitivity towards animals and ignorance of law are the main causes of animal abuse cases. “Many do not know the law and others do not care as punishment for injuring an animal is rare, which makes them fearless,” said Parmar. </p><p>Police officers said no separate data on victimised animals was available. From 2010 to 2020 nearly 20,000 cases have been recorded by the police with the help of NGOs and activists but just a few arrests have been made. “We register a case and investigate it and even make arrests,” said Navinchadra Reddy, deputy commissioner of police (zone 10). </p><p>The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 punishes all kinds of crimes against animals but the fine ranges between just <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>10 to <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>100. Moreover crimes against animals are put on the back burner by the police. “This is proof that crimes against animals are not taken seriously,” said Dr Radha Chaudhary, a veterinary. </p><p>Increasing cases and lengthy and costly procedures to register a police complaint was taking a toll on the activists now. Mohnani stated that there was just one government run hospital for animals in Mumbai but it was not free and the person who reports the crime is handed over the bill for treatment of the injured or abused animal. </p><p>Mohnani said that once a rescuer spots an injured animal, he immediately calls the BMC helpline which is not answered. If the rescuer gets hold of an official, he is asked to contact the nearest NGO or a veterinary doctor. The rescuer then has to pay for the ambulance to get the animal to the hospital in Parel or elsewhere. If the animal survives, the rescuer is asked to pay for its treatment or if it dies he has to pay for the last rites. He then has to spend time and money at the police station to register a complaint. </p><p>“It’s expensive and time consuming, so these days if the animal survives, we avoid filing an FIR due to which many crimes are not registered with the police,” said Mohnani. </p><p>During the lockdown, activists had to fight with several residential societies to allow pet owners to take them outside for their daily walks, “Animals do not understand lockdown, they need to relieve themselves but many residential societies banned the owners to do so. We had to register many police complaints for harassment to animals,” said Mohnani. </p><p><b>WHAT THE LAW SAYS</b></p><p>Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act makes all animal cruelties a criminal offence. Fines and imprisonment are both provided for. The Indian Penal Code has similar provisions. Under Section 506 of the IPC, it is a crime to threaten, abuse or harass neighbours who feed animals.</p><p>IPC Section 428 and 429 prescribe severe punishment of up to five years imprisonment to people resorting to dislocation, abduction and acts of cruelty towards community animals or pets and in such cases the police can arrest any offender without a warrant.</p>","<p>The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday announced fresh set of curbs for Mumbai, which has been battered by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.

We are grateful to the forest department for making the rescue a success. The startling increasing rate of habitat encroachment has resulted in decreasing prey base, territory and water sources for predator species like leopards that are then forced to come out into human habitation. Since these elusive cats usually prefer to move around at night, it is common for them to fall victim to uncovered wells.”</p><p>Yogesh Ghodke, regional forest officer, said, “We suspect that the leopard had fallen into the well at night while on the prowl for food.

Though NCP had decided not to drop Deshmukh (an NCP legislator) from the cabinet, the latter had to put in his papers after HC remarked how the Mumbai Police could probe allegations against the head of their department.</p><p>When the state government announced probe by a retired judge into the allegations against Deshmukh on March 30, it was assumed that he would be asked to resign. This was necessary to ensure a fair probe and to send a message to people that the government was serious about the corruption allegations. According to party leaders, the NCP top brass did not want any action against Deshmukh immediately, though there was unanimity about shifting him out of the home department at a later stage. However, the HC order and the remarks made by the court forced NCP to ask Deshmukh to resign. The delay on their part or the assumption that HC would not have ordered a CBI probe has led to an embarrassment for the party.</p><p>But then it has been a pattern with the MVA government and the NCP in the series of unexpected events ever since a vehicle with gelatin sticks was found outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani on February 25.</p><p><strong>Series of goof ups </strong></p><p>It began with a flip-flop over police officer Sachin Vaze. The government took its own time to shift him out of Mumbai Police’s crime intelligence unit, which was initially probing the case, even as Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis made direct allegations against him. While the Fadnavis-led Opposition launched a full-scale attack on the government following the death of trader Mansukh Hiran, the MVA’s response was confused, and lacked coordination. Vaze was suspended only after he was arrested. The same pattern was seen after allegations were made against Deshmukh over corruption, first by Fadnavis and then former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh.</p><p>A reason for the same was the differences between chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar. According to MVA leaders, Thackeray wanted NCP to drop Deshmukh from the cabinet following the allegation made by Singh. The NCP leadership on the other hand did not want to react immediately without understanding the political moves of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is also ruling in the Centre.</p><p>“There was clear lack of coordination between the allies. The approach to handle the issue seemed casual. There was no reason for the government to delay the announcement for probe. And once the probe was announced, they should have asked Deshmukh to resign or kept him away from the home department. It is hard to understand why a seasoned politician like Pawar did not do so,” opined political analyst Hemant Desai.</p><p>“With the entry of the CBI, things would no longer remain in control of the MVA government, as the central agency will conduct its own probe into the issue. And we have seen how the non-BJP parties have been accusing BJP of using central agencies against them for political purposes,” he added.</p><p>A senior Congress minister pointed out: “NIA is already probing the Antilia explosives case. Now CBI will probe the corruption allegations against Deshmukh. It is just a matter of time that the Enforcement Directorate too joins them in probing the [alleged] dealings of Vaze, and those whose names have been cropping up in this controversy. Imagine what will happen if they find links to any of the top MVA politicians.”</p><p>The fallout of the CBI probe is that the central agencies have now got something to put some of the key MVA leaders under the scanner. It could lead anywhere and affect the stability of the MVA government if any of their top leaders find themselves in trouble.</p><p>“If something like this happens, the political stability of the government could get affected. There seems to be tough times ahead for the Thackeray-led government,” said Desai.</p><p><strong>Options before MVA</strong></p><p>It has been a month of damage control for MVA leaders, and they are far from succeeding in it. With HC’s order on Monday, things could become more complicated.</p><p>“Our immediate plan is to challenge the court order on CBI probe. Why is there a need for a parallel probe when a retired HC judge is probing the allegations,” said a senior NCP minister.</p><p>The MVA will take a call on whether to challenge the decision in the Supreme Court as a government, or let Deshmukh appeal against it.</p><p>The three parties will also have to come together and plan a joint strategy, which does not seem to be the case as of now.</p><p>“It’s a three-party government and whatever happens, all the partners will have to face the consequences. However, the Vaze-Deshmukh controversy was treated as NCP’s matter. NCP consulted CM because they had to, but didn’t bother to seek our opinion. If it is a political battle, then all the three parties need to fight it together,” pointed out a senior Congress leader.</p><p>“The MVA’s problems are unlikely to end with Deshmukh’s resignation. In fact, they would begin now,” he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fadnavis on Monday said that some more names will come to light for their “involvement in the extortion case” during CBI investigation.</p><p>“As per the information I have, there are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation of the case. I would not name them now, but a lot more information will come to the fore soon. The alleged involvement of the [former] home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavy weights from the ruling parties are involved into the entire case of extortion. If there is money laundering or other money trail found to be involved, ED may also come into the picture,” he said.</p>","<p>Ahead of Class 10 and 12 board exams in Maharashtra, teachers across the state requested the education department to give them Covid-19 vaccine on a priority basis.</p><p>Teachers said that since it is important for all teachers on supervision duty to be virus-free, it is important to get them vaccinated soon. “Teachers should be vaccinated at special centres which should be set up in various schools. This way, teachers and non-teaching staff who will work for board exams will be safe to work,” said Shivnath Darade from Shikshak Parishad, a teachers group which wrote to the department recently.</p><p>As per the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released on the conduct of board exams, teachers and non-teaching staff have to be vaccinated before the conduct of board exams in the state. Similarly, staff members who will be on exam duty have to get negative RT-PCR report 48 hours before exams.</p><p>Teachers said the government should arrange for mass testing and vaccination for teachers. “If teachers have to get tested in such a short window, the government should set up centres in their respective schools. This way, it’ll be easy to cover the entire supervision staff at various centres,” said a teacher from a suburban school.</p><p>While HSC (Class12) exams will be held between April 23 and May 21, SSC (Class10) exams will be conducted between April 29 and May 20.

Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad can be covered in a matter of three weeks, for the population of above 45, if 1.5 crore doses are made available to the state by the government of India.”</p><p>He also stated that Maharashtra is the number one state in the country in terms of number of doses administered. “As of Sunday, 4th April 2021, we have administered 76.86 lakh doses of Covid vaccine, which is highest in the country,” Thackeray wrote. He also apprised Modi of the “break the chain” initiative taken by the state government to curb the spread. The state government Sunday issued directives for a partial lockdown in the state from 8pm on Monday to April 30, owing to the alarming increase in cases. Besides a complete lockdown on weekends, a strict night curfew of 11 hours, and prohibition of gatherings of more than five people during the day, the state announced shutting down of shops and establishments dealing in non-essential commodities, restaurants, eateries, malls, theatres, multiplexes, and religious places.</p><p>However, the decision is being opposed by many shop-owners in the city. Viren Shah from the federation of retail traders welfare association said that the members had detailed discussion on Monday regarding the notification. “We oppose the decision of closing down non-essential shops without any subsidy being offered. Our representatives will be meeting all government authorities to register our protest in the next few days,” Shah said. </p><p>However, experts said the health infrastructure in the state is already burdened and the measures will help contain the spread. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state-appointed task force, said that the directives should help in improving the situation in the next two-four weeks. However, it depends upon enforcement of the guidelines at the local level and co-operation by citizens.</p><p>“There is still a large invisible pool of suspected and asymptomatic Covid patients in the state. These measures are to identify these patients and ensure micro-containment so they do not become super-spreaders. Our health infrastructure is already burdened. People have to co-operate by following appropriate Covid behaviour,” Dr Joshi said.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state government has issued a new notification, putting some more services as essential — petrol pumps, data centers, fruit vendors etc. Also, the people coming or going to airport or railway stations for outstation travel, too, are exempted from the night curfew.</p><p>Moreover, the Central government has constituted 50 high level multi-disciplinary public health teams, highest so far, to be deployed to 50 districts across Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab owing to the ‘recent very large numbers of daily new coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and daily mortality being consistently reported by these States’. “The teams are being rushed to 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 districts of Chhattisgarh and 9 districts of Punjab to assist the State Health Department and local authorities,” said Union health ministry in a statement issued on Monday.</p><p>The teams are ordered to reach their respective allotted states latest by April 7, and before that the centre has also scheduled an orientation session on April 6.

Singh filed a criminal PIL on March 25 seeking a CBI probe into the alleged malpractices by Deshmukh. </p><p>The bench conducted a marathon hearing that lasted over six hours on Wednesday, March 31, wherein it heard not only Singh’s PIL but also two other PILs seeking similar action against Deshmukh as well as against Singh. The bench also heard Dr Patil’s petition. She sought an independent inquiry as well as directions to the Malabar Hill police station to register an FIR against Deshmukh. Dr Patil approached the high court after the Malabar Hill police station did not take action on a letter she had written on March 21 seeking registration of a complaint against Deshmukh. </p><p>The state had opposed Singh’s PIL on the grounds that his allegations were made after his transfer order was passed on March 17, which indicated that the PIL was a personal vendetta against Deshmukh. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni had further submitted that the allegations that police officers were directed by Deshmukh to indulge in extortion were not substantiated by the officers through any statement or affidavit and hence Singh’s claims could be construed as hearsay and the PIL was not maintainable. </p><p>Singh’s complaint regarding Rashmi Shukla was also refuted by the state. The Maharashtra government’s senior counsel Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that a high-level inquiry was conducted in September last year by the highest authorities, and after it was found that there had been no transfers or postings in that period, the inquiry was closed.</p><p>Kumbhakoni submitted that Patil’s letter to Malabar hill police station required an inquiry which is permitted for 15 days upto six weeks under the Code of Criminal Procedure, hence seekinga transfer of investigation to CBI would not be valid before the police have an opportunity to inquire into the issue. </p><p>After hearing the submissions, the bench observed that prima facie, Singh’s PIL was not maintainable as no FIR was registered. The court said that the basic premise of transferring an investigation could be held when an investigation was underway, however, in the absence of any FIR, as no investigation was going on, the court could not pass orders for transfer. </p><p>The court asked Singh as to why he had not registered an FIR against the home minister when he saw an offence being committed. The court also asked Singh why he had not exhausted his remedy of filing an FIR against Deshmukh by approaching the magistrate before approaching the court. </p><p>On Monday, while passing its judgement, the court observed that the high-level committee ordered by the state through a government notification led it to believe that there was no need for interference. It, however, held that it found substance in the arguments of Singh’s counsel, senior advocate Vikram Nankani and Upadhyay’s advocate Subhash Jha that it was an unprecedented case and as Deshmukh was the home minister and led the police, an independent investigation was required. The court then directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry and conclude it within 15 days but restrained it from registering an FIR immediately or to take up Patil’s complaint. </p><p>Thereafter the court observed that it was conscious that it had reserved its order on March 31 on the aspect of admissibility, however, in light of ts new order, the concerns raised in the petitions did not survive and hence they were being disposed of. The court also observed that Singh was at liberty to submit his grievance, if any, before an appropriate forum. </p><p>After the high court passed its order, Bharatiya Janata Party leader Atul Bhatkhalkar said the party welcomed the ruling “In the light of the high court’s ruling, the home minister himself should resign from the post. If he fails to do so, it is the duty of the chief minister to sack him from the post. The political leaders involved in the scam of transfer of police officers and the alleged ‘extortion racket’ should be punished,” he said.</p><p>Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis demanded Deshmukh’s resignation. “The CBI inquiry has been directed after the Bombay high court felt that the Mumbai Police failed to take a complaint into allegations by the former Mumbai Police commissioner. The CBI will now probe into the allegations of extortion and the involvement of the ministers and other heavyweight leaders of ruling parties. Taking moral responsibility, Deshmukh should resign. If he fails to do so, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should sack him,” he said. </p><p>Fadnavis added that it was unfortunate that the chief minister was conspicuously silent days after the “very serious allegations” came to the light. </p><p>Maharashtra Congress’ general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said the verdict set an unfortunate precedent. “The intention of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh was malafide while levelling allegations against the home minister. This has been stated by Bombay high court too in its observation. The officer was duty-bound to take action against the alleged corruption when it was revealed to him by his subordinates, instead, he chose to remain silent. The orders of preliminary inquiry by the CBI is uncalled for as the state government has already constituted a panel to probe the entire case.”</p><p>The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said that they were open to an investigation into the allegations against Deshmukh and a probe by a retired high court judge was already underway. Deshmukh is an NCP leader. </p><p>“The NCP or Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi [the Maharashtra government] has never denied any investigation into the allegations. In fact, the state government has already instituted an inquiry by a retired high court judge, which was upheld by the Bombay high court.

Sachin Vaze, a Mumbai cop, has been named as prime suspect in both cases, and two men have been arrested for Hiran’s murder. Several people have been questioned over the weeks, and the investigation is still ongoing as new evidence is unearthed.</p><p>Here are nine questions pertaining to the two interlinked cases that still remain a mystery.</p><p><strong>1. Why was the SUV abandoned near Ambani residence, Antilia? </strong></p><p>Senior NIA officials believe that Vaze, the former head of the Crime Intelligence Unit (CIU) of the Mumbai Crime Branch and the first lead investigator of the case, orchestrated the security scare outside billionaire industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, as a ploy to restore his reputation as a successful cop and regain lost glory. “He wanted to prove to Mumbai Police brass that he is still as good by solving a bomb conspiracy so he planned this whole episode to plant explosives outside Antilia. He wanted the limelight again,” a Delhi-based NIA officer has said.</p><p><strong>Also Watch | </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/news/watch-sachin-vaze-s-brother-reacts-to-nia-custody-extension-ambani-bomb-scare-101617470018879.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sachin Vaze’s brother reacts to NIA custody extension</strong></a></p><p>However, it still unclear as to why the Ambanis were targeted at all — from the car being parked outside the road across Antilia, to the threatening note to the industrialist, to the fact that the vehicle bore the number plates of Ambani’s security detail. The explosives were not assembled into a bomb, nor was a detonator or a timer found in the vehicle. Meanwhile, Vaze has denied his role in this case.</p><p><strong>2. Did suspended Mumbai police officer Sachin Vaze work alone in allegedly planning the security scare? </strong></p><p>The NIA has questioned several persons and recorded the statements of about 35 witnesses in connection with the Antilia security scare case, but the agency has only arrested one person so far: Vaze. However, on February 26, a Telegram channel was created by “jaishulhind” [Jaish-ul-Hind] and a message claiming responsibility for parking the vehicle outside Antilia was posted from that channel. A message seeking payment in bitcoin, a crypto currency, was also sent out on this channel, which reportedly had 10 members. The identity of the members is not immediately known as the maker of the channel closed the group the following day.</p><p>During the course of their investigation, the NIA discovered the Telegram message and traced it to the Tihar jail. The jail authorities also questioned an inmate, Tehsin Akhtar, the last known chief of the now dormant home-grown terror outfit Indian Mujahideen (IM), after two smart phones were recovered from his barrack in Tihar’s jail number 8, one of which reportedly sent out the message. However, officials are sceptical about this so-called terror outfit, and say that it’s unlikely such a group exists.</p><p><strong>3. Where were the 20 sticks of gelatin procured from? </strong></p><p>Gelatin sticks are cheap explosive material used typically in quarries and can be stored easily. They cannot explode without a detonator and are easily available in the grey market. It is, however, not clear as to where the 20 loose gelatin sticks found in the green Scorpio were procured from. The gelatin sticks found in the SUV were manufactured by Solar Industries Limited, Nagpur, a leading manufacturer of commercial explosives. The manufacturing, sale and use of gelatin is regulated under provisions of the Explosives Act, but the regulations are not strictly implemented. However, it’s still unclear where these sticks were bought, when and by whom.</p><p><strong>4. Why was Mansukh Hiran murdered? </strong></p><p>This crucial question still remains unanswered almost a month after the 48-year-old businessman’s death. Hiran knew Vaze for years; according to his wife’s statement to the ATS, Vaze had even borrowed the Scorpio from Hiran for four months and returned it to him on February 5. Hiran’s older brother, Vinod, was in touch with Vaze on the night Hiran went missing after leaving his home at 8.30pm.</p><p>Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said that one likely reason was that Hiran may have known too much of the accused in the explosives case. That explains why none of his belongings were found on him when his body was recovered from the creek.</p><p><strong>5. Where are Hiran’s belongings? </strong></p><p>When Hiran’s body was recovered from the creek in Thane district, his face was masked and his mouth had several handkerchiefs stuffed inside it. All his personal effects, including a gold ring, a wristwatch, a wallet, and the mobile phone — which he had on him when he left home at 8.30pm on March 4, according to wife Vimla’s statement to the police — were missing. The investigators have searched several places, including a godown allegedly belonging to Vaze located at Majiwade junction, as well as the houses of Shinde in Kalwa. Even Vaze’s house in Thane’s Saket Complex, has been searched a few times. However, Hiran’s belongings are not reported to have been recovered as yet.</p><p><strong>6. Why did Hiran meet Vaze on February 17?</strong></p><p>Based on the statement that Vimla, Hiran’s wife, gave to the ATS, we know that Hiran had taken the Scorpio on February 17 because he had some business in south Mumbai. We also know that Hiran left the car on the side of the road at Vikhroli, because the steering jammed. He then hailed a private taxi and went towards his destination.</p><p>According to CCTV camera footage captured outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), Hiran met Vaze outside the Crime Intelligence Unit office; the two sat in Vaze’s Mercedes for a short while, and then Hiran left. The following day, according to Vimla’s statement, Hiran reportedly went to the site where he had left the Scorpio and finding it missing, registered a stolen vehicle report. What did the two talk about in the car?</p><p><strong>7. Who is the woman discovered in the CCTV footage of Trident hotel where Vaze stayed in February 2021? </strong></p><p>The NIA has recovered a CCTV grab from Trident hotel, where Vaze stayed in February 2021, capturing a woman in her early 30s speaking to Vaze in the hotel corridor and carrying a currency notes counting machine in her hand. Another grab showed the woman leaving the hotel the next morning. NIA traced the woman and recorded her statement. Her identity is still a mystery.</p><p><strong>8 Was the stolen Maruti Eco involved in the entire episode? </strong></p><p>On March 28, the NIA recovered from Mithi river one laptop, one printer, two hard discs, two Central Processing Units, two Digital Video Recorders etc. which were allegedly damaged and thrown in the river. Besides this rich evidentiary haul, the federal agency also recovered a set of number plates of a Maruti Eco that was stolen from Aurangabad in November 2020. The vehicle was owned by Vinay Nade, who reported the vehicle stolen from Aurangabad on November 20, 2020. The question still remains: did the vehicle have anything to do with this crime?</p><p><strong>9. Do former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations regarding the Home Minister and Sachin Vaze have any bearing on the case? </strong></p><p>On March 20, Singh, who had recently been transferred out of his post, wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that Anil Deshmukh, the state’s home minister, had set a target for certain police officers, including Vaze, to collect <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other establishments in the city. Deshmukh denied these allegations and said that the investigators had probably come close to unearthing Singh’s role in the Antilia scare conspiracy.</p><p>A one-person committee to be headed by retired justice KU Chandiwal has been constituted to probe Singh’s allegations. The Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party alleged that senior politicians were protecting Vaze; but CM Uddhav Thackeray has said that the probe by investigation agencies will reveal the truth and no guilty party will be spared.</p>","<p>Bollywood actor and former ""Bigg Boss"" contestant Ajaz Khan, who was arrested by the NCB last week in connection with a drugs case, has tested positive for the coronavirus, an official said on Monday.</p><p>Khan's medical examination was conducted on Sunday following which his report came out positive for the viral infection, the NCB official said, adding that the actor will be shifted to a hospital.</p><p>Officials involved in the probe against Khan will also undergo test for Covid-19, he added.</p><p>Last Tuesday, Khan was initially detained by the NCB's Mumbai zonal unit after he landed at the city airport from Rajasthan.</p><p>His name had cropped up during the interrogation of arrested drug peddler Shadab Batata, the official said.</p><p>Accordingly, Khan was questioned by the NCB at its office in south Mumbai and his statement was recorded.</p><p>After examining his role in the crime, he was placed under arrest and later remanded in the NCB's custody by a local court, the official said.</p>","<p>Summer is here and so are the restrictions. Covid numbers are showing a massive spike every passing day in Pune, and in parts of Maharashtra. The second wave has set in amid anxious worries about how far it will go.</p><p>The dashboard prepared by city administration showed on Sunday morning there are no ICU beds available in Pune. </p><p>The situation is a chilling reminder of August last year, when many died in the absence of oxygen support or access to ventilators. </p><p>The Jumbo Covid unit restarted by state government has also been completely occupied and people are scrambling for beds. </p><p>It’s been more than a year since Pune saw Maharashtra’s first case. Prior to the pandemic, PMC hospitals in the city did not even have a single operating ventilator. Did the local and state authorities ramp up health infrastructure in the past one year?</p><p>Among the few things the Pune Municipal Corporation did was to convert its Baner facility into a 300-bed hospital, using Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) measures. </p><p>The facility currently has 312 beds for critical care, including 270 oxygenated beds, 26 ICU beds and 16 ventilators. The hospital is currently dedicated for Covid-19 patients, but will eventually be opened for other ailments once the pandemic comes to an end. </p><p>Besides Baner, the state government created a Jumbo facility, which had to be closed in Decembe,r and resurrected by March whenCovid numbers began to surge. </p><p>One of the oldest medical facilities, Sassoon General Hospital, also saw a major upgrade after 11 years. </p><p>On the whole though, neither PMC, nor the district administration utilised the past year to permanently create some robust health infrastructure that will last for years to come. </p><p>In fact, around 42 per cent of the operational ventilators under new additions in most of the public hospitals in Pune and a few private hospitals were donated by the Pune Platform for Covid Response (PPCR), created by industry body MCCIA. </p><p>Through donations from corporates, PPCR donated 263 ventilators and 107 High Flow Nasal Oxygen units to various hospitals in Pune.</p><p>All this help is very useful, but not adequate to tackle a pandemic such as this, when the daily caseload of Pune district on Saturday went up to 10,800; a scary figure. </p><p>When cases are rising substantially and health infrastructure is falling short, many countries have opted during the past one year to stop the movement of people. </p><p>Curbs have its cost, but benefits may overweigh these, provided the government takes a humanitarian approach and offer financial assistance.</p><p>During the period of restrictions when people’s movement is affected, rigorous testing and tracing of contacts has shown that the surge can be controlled effectively. </p><p>During the last week of February and early days of March, two districts of Maharashtra – Amravati and Yavatmal – startled everyone when the positivity rate reached around 50%. </p><p>Families after families tested positive in these two cities as the virus had penetrated most localities. The authorities then started testing all possible close contacts to trace infected people. </p><p>By March third week, the positivity rate of Amravati and Yavatmal came down to at 12% and 9%, respectively, and by April, it showed a further dip. </p><p>In Pune, the positivity rate during the past week crossed 32 %. On Saturday, it touched 34.70 %. Despite the high rate, sample testing hasn’t increased as much as it should have, neither has contact tracing happening on a mass level. Most housing societies declared as micro-containment zones have been failing to strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. If people are not following norms, the government has little choice, but to go for restrictions. </p>","<p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dilip Walse Patil will take over as Maharashtra's new home minister after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray accepted Anil Deshmukh's resignation on Monday evening. Deshmukh, also an NCP leader, resigned over allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.</p><p>In the resignation letter sent to Thackeray, Deshmukh said he doesn't find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the order of Bombay high court, which earlier on Monday ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary investigation against him.</p><p>The high court observed that there can no independent probe into the allegations of corruption against Deshmukh if the investigation is handed to Mumbai Police, which is headed by the state home minister. The court order came on a petition by Singh and others which claimed that Deshmukh was running an ""extortion racket"". Singh's accusations came after he was transferred to the Home Guards for improper handling of the Ambani bomb scare case. Singh alleged that the former state home minister Anil Deshmukh appointed suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>100 crore every month from various establishments in Mumbai.</p><p>The claims were first made by Singh in a letter to Thackeray. He also approached the Supreme Court, which directed Singh to move the high court against Deshmukh.</p><p>After the Bombay High Court's order, a meeting was held between the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar at Sharad Pawar's residence Silver Oak in south Mumbai where the issue was discussed in detail. </p><p>State rural development minister Hassan Mushrif will be taking over the labour portfolio while deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar will take over the excise department. </p>","<p>With no connectivity, issues with the transport system and no Covid-19 vaccination centre in their villages –residents of Paud and 28 other villages in Mulshi taluka were clueless on how to get vaccinated until Ankush More – an activist decided to arrange a free bus ride service to the vaccination centre.</p><p>A resident has to travel a minimum of 50 kilometres to get vaccinated at the village Male or Ambavane. More and other activists came out with the plan and now everyday 100 residents (senior citizens and 45 plus) are getting vaccinated since March 30. Until now 400 residents have been vaccinated.</p><p>Most of these villages are in the back side of the Mulshi dam which makes transport connectivity a problem. There are 600 active Covid-19 cases in Mulshi taluka.</p><p>“Last Friday, the vaccination centre had few issues so we did not take the villagers for vaccination otherwise the process is going smoothly. Most of the senior citizens in villages are living alone as their children are in cities so we are making sure that these people do not suffer and get vaccinated,” said Ankush More an activist and working president of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Mulshi taluka.</p><p>The total population of these villages are around 23,000. Near these villages there are also 42 small hamlets where most of the people work in farms.</p><p>“We will be covering these people as well under the vaccination. Our members are reaching out to them personally and explaining the importance of vaccination,” said More.</p><p>The buses will continue to provide service for two more months. Prior to a day before going to the vaccination, activists collect the list of members and submit it to the vaccination centres and accordingly everything is organised at the centre.</p><p>“The bus system was a must otherwise these villagers might have ignored the vaccination process because state transport buses are not that frequent. This initiative is giving good promotion to vaccination drives and senior citizens who are taking vaccines are also promoting it nicely so villagers who were afraid to take vaccines are now coming in big numbers. Two days ago, we vaccinated 170 people in a day,” said Dr Sambhaji Satpute health department head, Ambavane.</p><p>“The main purpose of starting the centre at Mulshi Khurd and Male was to reduce distance so more people come for vaccination,” added Satpute.</p><p>Even before the rise of Covid-19, these activists used to run free ambulance service for villagers.</p><p>“Our main aim was to get more and more people to get vaccinated. Once we are providing them transport service for free, they are getting ready to get vaccinated,” said Mahadeo Kondhare, president of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Mulshi taluka.</p>","<p>As the daily caseload in Pune district has been on the rise, the district administration is emphasising on early detection of cases in rural parts of Pune district. </p><p>The rural administration is also focusing on the early management of a Covid case to prevent further deterioration of the patient. Pune Zilla Parishad claimed that this policy has become instrumental in ensuring the availability of the ventilator beds and the low mortality rate. </p><p>“We have focused on the early detection of the cases with the help of Asha workers. Our challenge is to detect the onset of any sort of distress in 48 hours. Currently, our rate of detection is around 97 per cent. Only three percent of the cases are coming to us after 48 hours. Now, our goal is to detect these 97 cases in 0-24 hours,” said Ayush Prasad, CEO, Pune Zilla Parishad. </p><p>On Sunday, Pune district recorded 12,472 Covid positive cases in a single day and 2,844 were reported from the rural parts. As the urban parts have been experiencing shortage of critical care beds, the Pune dashboard indicates the availability of the beds in rural parts. </p><p>Ayush Prasad explained how the administration has been ensuring the availability of the beds in rural areas. </p><p>“In Covid-19, generally the time window is of five to six days until the patient needs a ventilator. So, we are following very strict norms during this period. We are insisting on comprehensive blood tests and other tests. We are calculating the new score. It gives us an idea whether the condition of the patient will deteriorate. If it comes to this then we refer the patent to DCH from CCC and where efforts are taken to improve the patient’s condition,” said Prasad. </p><p>He also claimed that if early management of Covid patients is properly done then the need of a ventilator could be avoided. </p><p>On the other hand, rural police claimed that there has been a good response from rural parts to the adherence to the new restrictions and 12-hour curfew. </p><p>“We have continued our action on the violators of Covid norms but in rural areas many are following the rules of restrictions by their own. The new heights of the Covid positive patients have reached the villages and people have become cautious,” said Milind Mohite, additional superintendent of police, Baramati Division. </p>","<p>The restrictions announced in Pune last week has spiralled many businesses into unexpected losses, and the most affected are beauty parlours, and gymnasiums who feel that it is injustice to close down a place where residents can build better immunity to fight Covid-19. </p><p>Jitendra Shirodkar was looking forward to his regular workouts at the Gold’s gym in Aundh when the mini lockdown was announced, which now have disturbed his daily exercise routine. </p><p>“The government is stressing on lockdown and closing down gyms. This is totally wrong if they want people to build immunity, they should allow gyms to remain open,” Shirodkar said. </p><p>ABS fitness downed the shutters on all their gyms in the city as soon as the announcement was made. </p><p>“It is indeed very sad that we have to close the shutters once again, just when we had opened them a few months back. Last year was a complete loss and now just when we have opened up, the government calls for a lockdown. Gyms in fact are the safest place with all precautions in place. In the last two months, we have had no Covid positive cases at all of members coming in for exercises. The lockdown is going to not just affect the business but also the health of the people. If people don’t exercise, how will they gain immunity against such diseases,” said Shekhar Sable, founder, director, for ABS fitness. </p><p>HIIT80, a boutique gym in Balewadi has found a way to reach out to its members while maintaining lockdown restrictions. </p><p>“It is true that one needs to be healthy to maintain immunity and hence with the lockdown announcement, we have taken up giving online lessons to our members using social media. We are not making any money, but health comes first,” said Crispin Lamont, owner, HIIT80. </p><p>The Tilak swimming tank which brought joy to several people who looked at respite from the heat also shut down. </p><p>“Last year was a major loss and during the month of May we tend to have a good number of members, taking our earnings to around <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>60 to 70 lakh, but we are not sure of making up for the losses. What worries us more is that our coaches are suffering the most, for some of them, coaching is their livelihood,” said, Tilak tank secretary Amit Golwalkar. </p><p>The malls wore a deserted look, with only the housekeeping staff going about for the last time before locking the doors. </p><p>Westend mall in Aundh closed the doors from Sunday as soon as the lockdown was announced. </p><p>The beauty parlours in the city are still unsure about the dates of closing shops. </p><p>Sakhee beauty parlour owner Shaila Nagpure said, “We are open today, but unsure of how the day will be. We will be closing from Tuesday following the orders but this lockdown will affect us very badly and not sure if we will recover from losses.” </p><p>Similarly, another beauty parlour Maria’s salon in Koregaon park too was operational. </p><p>“We are closing from tomorrow but today there are not many clients walking in. This lockdown will be bad for us,” said Jenny, one of the hairdressers. </p>","<p> The new restrictions imposed in Pune by the district administration has made life difficult for office-goers like Dipti Mohite. </p><p>“Our office timings were 10 am to 6 pm earlier which were changed to 9 am to 5 pm by the office administration, but I travel by the public transport bus daily from home to office. As my husband also works in another private company and his timings are almost the same, I have to manage to go to office either by a private auto rickshaw or now looking for share rides with another office colleagues,” said Mohite. </p><p>Thousands of officegoers, workers working at market shops and small factories all around the district are facing a similar situation </p><p>Vipul Alekar, a businessman in Hadapsar said, “In our factory there are 15 workers and we have called them in two shifts for work after the new restrictions were given. As most of them stay nearby, they come walking or travel on bike but continuing work in these changed timings is really costing us financially as well as the business has gone down by almost 50 per cent.” </p><p>At Laxmi road and Tulshibaug market, shop owners call workers early in the morning and at around 5 to 5.30 pm shops are closed before the night curfew starts at 6 pm. </p><p>From 5 pm to 6 pm, there is a massive crowd seen across city roads, as there is a rush to return home before the restrictions begin. </p><p>Most officer goers stop on the way home to buy vegetables, groceries and other household items. </p><p>Archana Somavanshi, branch manager at one of the courier services on Tilak road said, “As ours is a service oriented work, we need to keep our shop open for the public. Our regular office timings have now been changed to 8.30 am to 5.30 pm. I manage my household works of cooking food for kids and other preparations early in the morning, and then return back home at around 6 pm.” </p>","<p>Around 38 per cent of the students of Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) and its affiliated colleges remained absent on the first day of the mock tests. In a bid to spread awareness about the online examination software to students, the mock tests are going to be held starting from April 5 to 9. </p><p>While on its first day, a total of 1,10,017 students from Science and Engineering streams were expected to appear for the exams, of which only 68,470 students appeared which is 62 per cent of the total number of students. </p><p>While students who appeared for the mock test today faced some technical issues, some didn’t receive their username and password and students faced other issues while giving the online mock test exams. </p><p>Madhukar Kulkarni an SPPU student said, “Even after selecting the answer it was not saved in the system, while there was connectivity issue and questions were not loading properly despite having a good internet connection. My timer remained running when I had called to the call centre for getting the solution on my technical issue and no one received my call from the call centre as I called thrice.” </p><p>Last year, from October 12, 2020, SPPU started its final year exams for 3,300 subjects for which 2.5 lakh students enrolled. From the first day onwards both online and offline students faced a lot of issues while appearing for the exam and it even continued in the results. For the offline exams, 113 centres were identified where physical exams were conducted in Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. These exams were 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) for a one-hour duration. </p><p>Now the students have started preparing for the examination which is starting from April 11, and there are a total of 3,700 subjects for which the examination will be conducted through online mode. </p><p>Rekha Mirashe, another student said, “It was quite a good experience to appear for the mock test examination today, there was not much problem while appearing for the test compared to last year.” </p>","<p>Kavita Reuji Phadtare (37), a resident of Krushna Park was killed after she was run over by a speeding Leyland container near Hotel Marathe Shahi near Jambhulwadi on April 4. </p><p>The deceased was crossing the road when a speeding tempo came and hit. She died on the spot and sustained head and abdominal injuries leading to her death. </p><p>Police constable Ajit Kokare lodged a complaint against an unidentified driver at Bharati Vidyapeeth police station. The police have invoked charges ranging from rash and negligent driving to sections of the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA). </p><p>Bharati Vidyapeeth police station officials said that they visited the spot immediately after the accident and the statement of eyewitnesses have been recorded.

The letter dated March 31 emphasised that Air India group flew over 2.9 million passengers through the pandemic as frontliners, yet since April 2020, an “illegal pay cut” has been forcefully implemented upon them which no other public sector undertaking (PSU) has undergone.</p><p>“…effective April 2020, a unilateral and illegal pay cut has been forcefully implemented upon us...throughout the pandemic no other PSU has undergone such a drastic pay cut. Air India awarded a 70% pay cut to the very section of employees who during Covid times reported for duty, putting themselves as well as their near and dear ones at risk of getting infected. At the same time the management gave themselves a paltry 10% cut while effectively being cocooned in the safety of their own homes,” the letter stated.</p><p>The pilots had written to their management on March 23 highlighting factors such as the airline management’s decisions to remove pre-flight Covid testing and cancel or curtail pilot leaves. They also questioned the government on not rolling back their pay cuts despite seeing a rise in domestic travel.</p><p>Air India did not comment on the matter.</p><p>A pilot said, “In our recent letter to our CMD Shri Rajiv Bansal dated March 23, we highlighted several factors such as the Air India management’s decisions to remove pre-flight Covid testing, cancel or curtail pilot leaves and, the most recent one, to discontinue providing all meals to pilots in rooms at domestic hotels. These strategic and intentional decisions of the management are a clear indication that they believe that the worst is behind us.”</p><p>They pointed out the steady return of the aviation sector towards normalcy, despite which their wages continue to be paid out with the 70% pay cut.</p><p>“We strongly urge you to intervene and roll back this unilateral and illegal pay cut enforced on the licensed category of Air India’s employees as of January 1, 2021 in line with other Indian airlines. At this crucial juncture of the government’s efforts to privatise Air India, we reach out to you with a lot of apprehensions about our arrears, wages and service conditions which have not been addressed since 2006. We request you to grant us an audience at the earliest,” the letter concluded.</p>","<p>At a time when colleges are gearing up for summer session examinations, first-year law students are only now beginning their academic year. With admissions to first-year law courses in both three-year and five-year courses still underway, colleges are now worried that they will end up with two first-year batches in 2021, leaving them unable to handle the same.</p><p>“As per the recent announcement by the examination department of the University of Mumbai (MU), first-semester law exams are scheduled to take place in the second week of June, so the second semester exams will only take place in September or October, by when the next academic year admissions will begin. How are colleges supposed to handle two different first-year batches at the same time?” asked the principal of a suburban law institute.</p><p>He added that this fear is affecting teachers who have been working non-stop since September last year, when MU asked colleges to start online lectures. “Last year, they started work with second- to fifth-year law students, now they’ll start lectures for first-year batches and also conduct two rounds of examinations between May and June 2021. And by the time the first-year batch is ready to graduate, the next academic year will begin,” he said.</p><p>Admissions to most professional courses were delayed by a few months this year, first due to the lockdown and then due to a petition filed in the Bombay high court for clarity on the status of the Maratha quota. In December, the registration process for most professional courses including law, engineering, architecture and pharmacy had to be delayed by a few weeks to give students time to make necessary changes to their admission form after the state government decided to continue admissions without the inclusion of the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota.</p><p>After much delay, the first lists of the three-year and five-year law courses were scheduled to be released in the first week of February, but the same had to be postponed again after the state common entrance test (CET) cell received complaints of error in student information. At present, the institutional round of admissions is underway and law colleges will start regular lectures soon.</p><p>While the university has declared dates of commencement of exams, the department has also asked teachers to conduct extra lectures to complete the curriculum. “Law is a course which needs to be taught at length. And since classes are being conducted online, we’ve requested teachers to conduct extra classes on weekdays and weekends to ensure that students are not at a loss of academic time,” said AK Singh, dean, law department at MU. </p><p>He further added that due to the fallout of delay in the 2020-21 academic year, it is likely that admissions to the next academic year could also get delayed. “Hopefully colleges will not need to face the problem of two first-year batches studying together,” added Singh.</p><p>Meanwhile, Students Law Council has approached the vice-chancellor and director of examinations and evaluation of MU, requesting them to allow the 2020-21 first-year law students to study and appear for exams together with the 2021-22 batch. “This way, students as well as teachers will get time to breath, and there will be no need for repetition of syllabus in the same year,” said Sachin Pawar, president of the council.</p>","<p>The Bombay high court (HC) on Monday struck down the decision of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) general body to disqualify BJP-nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat as a standing committee member. HC has ordered the civic body to reinstate him as a member of the standing committee of the civic body.</p><p>Shirsat had approached the HC after the chairman of the standing committee had disqualified him on October 21, 2020. </p><p>A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni had concluded hearing of Shirsat’s petition last month and had reserved its order. During the hearing, advocate Amogh Singh for Shirsat had informed the court that the rules relied upon by the BMC standing committee to disqualify Shirsat was not as per the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, and hence it was “illegal” and in “colourable exercise of power”. </p><p>The standing committee had based its disqualification of Shirsat on the fact that a member was required to be an elected member, and Shirsat’s disqualification was justified as he was a nominated member. </p><p>BMC had opposed Shirsat’s petition on the grounds that he had not challenged the rules, which the HC had accepted and directed him to pay <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1 lakh to the civic body for “wasting BMC’s time”. </p><p>Thereafter, Shirsat had sought permission to amend the petition which was allowed and he challenged the rules that the civic body had relied on while disqualifying him. On October 23, the day when the civic body had held an urgent general body meeting to ratify the decision of the standing committee, the HC had granted interim relief to Shirsat to continue as a member of the standing committee until his plea was heard. </p><p>While passing its order, the bench observed, “The act of removal of petitioner does not have statutory support and does not have legal ground. Petition stands allowed.”</p>","<p>Struggling to bring coronavirus positive cases under control, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Monday issued a fresh order notifying that barring the essential services shops, other establishments and markets in Pune city will remain closed till April 30.</p><p>All private offices will also remain shut except the offices of cooperative, public and private sector banks, insurance companies, telecom firms, IT &amp; ITes firms and other offices related to lawyers, CAs and financial entities, it said.</p><p>As per the order, a curfew (barring essential services) will be imposed in the city from 6 pm on Fridays to 7 am on Mondays as part of the weekend lockdown.</p><p>""As per the state government's direction, except for the essential services shops, all the shops and markets in the city will remain closed till April 30.

Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said that one more minister from the state government will resign in the next eight days.</p><p>Speaking in Pune on the occasion of the BJP’s 41st foundation day, Patil said that there are at least seven ministers with criminal records in the MVA government. He said that the ministers’ offences are very serious in nature and claimed that the state government will fall on its own.</p><p>“There are 6-7 ministers in the state cabinet who are facing serious criminal charges. One of the ministers is facing imprisonment for beating up a policeman, while another has recently revealed his relationship outside wedlock. One of the ministers’ son-in-law is in jail in connection with a drug case, while another is facing charges of beating a party worker. We are not interested in taking the resignation of any minister, but it is going to happen naturally. Like in cricket, the first few wickets bat for a longer time, but the tail-enders fall quickly. Similarly, the next resignations from MVA ministers will come at shorter intervals,” he said.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-political-interference-in-police-administration-maha-s-new-home-minister-101617702778952.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Patil starts stint as Maharashtra home minister with a promise and appeal in SC</a></b></p><p>Patil said that while the list of wrongdoings of some ministers from the MVA government has already been in the public domain, a few more names will be added to it in the next few days. “The MVA government will collapse under its own deeds. There is no need to put in special efforts to topple it. The BJP will fight the elections on its own and form the government without joining hands with any other party,” Patil said.</p><p>On Monday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that a few more names will come to light for their involvement in the “extortion” case during the CBI investigation. “There are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation of the case. The alleged involvement of the home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavyweights from the ruling parties are involved in the entire case of ‘extortion’,” he said.</p><p>According to the BJP leaders, the state unit has decided to go become more aggressive against the MVA government over issues such as corruption and lockdown.</p>","<p>We are entering the 50th year since the 1972 United Nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm, which was the first global conference to make the environment a major issue. It was also in 1972, that a group of young researchers at MIT, USA, presented their report called “Limits to Growth”, with the key message that unlimited economic growth on a finite planet is impossible. </p><p>Over the last few decades, questions have been asked in relation to that message, and especially with greater understanding of climate change and globalisation: who is growing - is it transnational corporations? What does “growth” mean – is it the well-being of people, or do we mean GDP growth, even counting pollution clean-up as growth? What is the impact of economic growth on people and the environment – does it lead to a better life for all, or profits for some and poverty for many?</p><p>Economic growth, especially in the last 50 years, has certainly led to increasing carbon emissions, and the prospect of dangerous climate change. We only have about a decade to get our act right.</p><p>While India seems on track with renewable energy targets, the new discussion is: can India set itself more ambitious targets of carbon emission reduction?</p><p>While the average carbon footprint per person in India is not high, globally, we still have the third largest collective footprint as a country. Growth in food, education, healthcare, infrastructure, has led to many gains over the past few decades. But, now we need to check our growing carbon footprint.</p><p>The Climate Collective Pune (https://www.climatecollectivepune.org/) formed by a few like-minded individuals in 2018 has been deliberating upon the idea of carbon neutrality.</p><p>Suggestions submitted to the environment minister include: very large increases in distributed solar power, including rooftop systems for domestic use; improving energy management and doing away with diesel gen-sets; complete (or maximal) shift to electric vehicles; and extensive ecological restoration and greening to sequester carbon.</p><p>The Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC), developed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, has provisions for how to make buildings more energy efficient. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have already adopted it. </p><p>MEDA and the Urban Development Department have key roles to play. </p><p>Since electric cars and bikes are still cars and bikes, occupying road space and using energy currently still generated from dirty coal, we do need to change the way we travel. Reducing private motorised modes will improve road safety, make more efficient use of road infrastructure, and make active travel realistic and safer for those who do choose to walk and cycle. </p><p>Last week, Climate Collective Pune launched Eco Fusion, an e-magazine to reach out to Punekars with ideas for becoming more environmentally responsible and climate resilient. In his article, Dr Chirag Dhara, a scientist with IITM, Pune, suggests that we must go beyond renewables and electric vehicles.</p><p>We need a close look at growth and consumption such as private vehicles, fashion, junk food, fuelled by planned obsolescence and advertising leading to “manufacturing of desires”! These cause extravagant use of fossil fuels, minerals, fresh water which are in limited supply. Chirag suggests that we must engage with the idea of “de-growth”, and aim for a conscious change from profligate consumption.</p><p>Ashish Kothari, a founder member of Kalpavriksh, suggests we should go further than de-growth, which is an idea emerging in the developed world. We need to listen to “ecological democracy” voices emerging in the grassroots movements in India.</p><p>The key ideas of ecological democracy pertain to living within ecological limits, as well as with equity. There is no single right answer, but communities may evolve their own local solutions in a convivial way, fostering social justice using direct democracy methods. This itself can make life more meaningful.</p><p>Alternatives Forum, or Vikalp Sangam (https://vikalpsangam.org/) has been documenting many such inspirational grassroots movements from across India.</p><p>What is ecological democracy in the urban context, and in the urban-rural-regional context? Could urban movements engage more consciously with and benefit from the ideas of ecological democracy? Is it possible to start at a neighbourhood - or city-scale in Pune?</p><p>The pandemic has increased economic recession and large-scale distress among urban poor and informal economies. How can we “decarbonise” as well as make life better, especially for the poor?</p><p>These are among the most important conversations we must have. </p>","<p>The woman who alleged she was harassed by Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren has informed the Bombay high court that she does not want to pursue the petition seeking the registration of an FIR against Soren anymore.

The administrator informed the court that he had been writing to the BMC and fire brigade about shop owners in the mall not abiding by safety rules but no action was taken which resulted in the fire and hence he should not be held responsible. </p><p>A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale while hearing the petition filed by Sahasrabuddhe through advocate JS Kini was informed that his client was an officer of the court and was appointed as an administrator of Dream Mall by the NCLT in August 2018. Kini submitted that Sahasrabuddhe had been submitting a monthly report to NCLT on implementation of various orders passed by the tribunal from time to time. </p><p>The bench was informed that after the fire broke out the police registered an FIR on March 26 wherein Sahasrabuddhe has also been named and as he apprehended arrest, he had approached the HC seeking interim protection from arrest and quashing of the FIR. “I am an officer of the court and cannot be expected to run from pillar to post seeking anticipatory bail, hence I have approached the court,” said Kini on behalf of Sahasrabuddhe. </p><p>Public prosecutor Aruna Pai for the police informed the court that Sahasrabuddhe was not named as an accused in the case and hence had no need to apprehend arrest. However, on instructions from DCP Dhakne, Pai assured the court that the administrator would not be arrested till April 8. </p><p>After hearing the submissions the court accepted the assurance and issued notice to the civic authorities and the fire brigade and posted hearing on April 8. </p>","<p>htmetro@htlive.com</p><p>Mumbai</p><p>It seemed a normal work day for Bhaskar Sawant, manager of an optician’s store at Parel in central Mumbai, till a police constable walked in. “The policeman told me there was a mini lockdown due to surge in Covid-19 and I needed to close down my shop till April 30,” rued Sawant. Sawant was under the impression that there would be a complete lockdown only on Saturdays and Sundays, while on other days, he would have to close by 8pm considering the night curfew in place. “How can we survive with such lockdowns? We could hardly survive last year somehow and any new one means massive losses,” rued Sawant.</p><p>Similar confusion was witnessed in the adjoining Hindmata market. On being asked to down the shutters, the shop owners reached the Bhoiwada police station, but were told sternly that a mini lockdown was in place and only essential items are allowed.</p><p>Across the state, traders resorted to sloganeering and protesting against the mini lockdown. The wholesale markets across the states however had announced the closure and many even closed their main shutters.</p><p>Protests were held across the state at various places like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Satara where traders were seen holding placards and sloganeering against the government.</p><p>By afternoon, a majority of Mumbai wore a deserted look as shops were closed down and there were hardly any people on the streets. The wholesale markets which are normally full witnessed hardly any citizens.</p><p>Nirmal Nahar, a cloth wholesaler from the Mangaldas market at Kalbadevi, who says that lockdown has come at the wrong time. “This is a wedding season and even Ramzan festival is arriving next week. This complete closure means total loss for me,” said Nahar. “The problem is if we shut shop, our consumers will buy from Gujarat.”</p><p>On the streets, the citizens were also worried about the fall out of this mini lockdown. “We faced huge problems during the last lockdown and still we were not able to contain the Covid-19 virus. There are many things one needs apart from medicines and groceries. The government cannot deny us these,” said Mehboob Sayed, a resident of Pydhonie in South Mumbai.</p><p>The state government’s decision to ensure 50 percent attendance in government offices and allow only companies with financial dealings to function in private officials witnessed a significant drop of commuters in trains and buses. “There was a noticeable dip in train passengers,” said a senior official of the central railways.</p><p>The bus conductors refused to take standees which resulted in many of the passengers not being taken inside.</p><p>Rahul Sharma, who travels from Shivaji Park to Byculla for work, said he could not take three buses as all seats were full. “I had to go to Mahim depot to get the bus. It was quite a comfortable travel as usually buses used to be fully packed,” said Sharma.</p><p>Many running financial institutions also did not come to work as they have been asked to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated fully or else have a RT-PCR negative Covid-19 test result every 15 days. Nitin Nikalje, owner, Gati Investments which deals in stocks and insurance, said it was better to skip work. “How can I force my employees to take the test every 15 days? They will not agree to it,” said Nikalje. </p>","<p>The Maharashtra revenue and forest department on Monday notified the Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary, which will be spread over 269 square kilometres in Chandrapur district. This takes the state’s total tally of wildlife sanctuaries to 50. The move comes eight years after the proposal was first tabled in April 2013, with officials attributing the delay largely due to resistance from the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which had large-scale logging operations in the area.</p><p>The move to notify the area as WLS under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) — which received the chief minister’s assent during a meeting of the state wildlife board in December 2020 — will enhance protection for the area’s tiger population (20 tigers including cubs), and also give legal sanctity to this key wildlife habitat falling in the tiger corridor between Tadoba tiger reserve in Chandrapur and the Kawal wildlife sanctuary in Telangana’s Mancherial district.</p><p>“The tiger population in Chandrapur has grown considerably over the last 10 odd years, and the area which has now been notified is a known tiger breeding area/ corridor that facilitates dispersal of the population from one protected area to another, between Tadoba and Kawal,” said state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe.</p><p>The benefits of this move, Rithe said, would not only help to reduce human-tiger conflict in the region (which has seen over 150 human deaths due to tiger conflict in the last 13 years), but will also give an impetus to wildlife tourism and education measures. “There is a chance now to provide gainful employment to members of the local community, but also generate revenue for the state,” Rithe added.</p><p>Of the 269 sq. kms, which have been notified on April 5, about 18 sq. kms. come under the Central Chanda forest division, while 251 sq. km. comes under the control of the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which will no longer be allowed to harvest timber in the area. Instead, officials said, the state government would compensate the FDCM, which has sought allocation of alternate 250 sq kms of productive forest land. The FDCM has also sought employment for van majdoors as part of the Widlife Sanctuary.</p><p>The area, which Rithe said is one of the last remaining tracts of primary forest in Maharashtra, boasts a rich biodiversity, including leopards, sloth bears, wild boar, wild dogs, jackals and gaur. “It is all the more important to bring the area under protection because it is a pristine forest. Even though a the forest area has been affected due to commercial forestry and timber extraction by the FDCM,we still have natural old trees and natural forest composition, which you rarely find in other parts of the state,” he said.</p>","<p>

</city>n addition to the state government’s guidelines on lockdown, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday ordered that all beaches in the city shall remain shut till April 30. The BMC chief also reiterated that every housing society with more than five cases shall be declared a micro-containment zone, and a police personnel shall be deployed outside the gate of the society. </p><p>According to the circular issued by the BMC, every society being declared as a micro containment zone will have to display a board at the gate of their society and have to deny entry to visitors. Supply of essentials and from that of e-commerce will not be restricted, however, the society will have to develop a mechanism to ensure delivery to the individual flat owner. The BMC has also stated that housing societies that violate the rule of micro-containment zones will have to pay a fine of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>10,000 on first instance and <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>20,000 on subsequent instances. </p><p>On Tuesday, the city reported 10,040 cases and 32 deaths, taking the tally to 472,600 and toll to 11,832.

Of these, 35,978 were citizens between the age of 45-59, 12,260 were senior citizens above the age of 60 years, followed by 1,803 frontline workers and 553 health care workers.</p><p>Further, the BMC has also directed private laboratories to ensure 24-hour turnaround time for declaring results of Covid-19 positive patients, further asking laboratories to ensure the reports shall be first given to the BMC and to the patient on subsequent day. The BMC chief has also directed private hospitals to undertake tests using rapid antigen kits only on symptomatic patients, and also ensure that no tests are done using the rapid antigen kits without taking permission from the BMC. </p><p>In a separate order issued on Tuesday, the BMC has also revised the standard operating procedures (SOP) to handle passengers arriving from the UK, Brazil, Europe, South Africa and Middle-East. Passengers arriving from these countries are quarantined in hotels for seven days, however, there have been instances where such passengers go missing from hotels. Hence, the BMC has revised guidelines, making it mandatory for their officers to visit the hotels twice during the stay of a particular passenger and maintain a weekly report of such visits. </p><p>Chahal said, “Tuesday was the first day of lockdown, and I am sure that if citizens will follow Covid-19 guidelines, cases will start coming down in the city.” </p><p>Meanwhile, amid the rising need for beds in hospitals in the backdrop of cases increasing in the city, the BMC on Tuesday once again appealed to citizens to call 1916 or ward control room for bed allotment rather than visiting making rounds to every hospital. According to BMC’s dashboard, of the total 17,178 beds, 4,130 beds are vacant. </p>","<p> The Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials has arrested builder Yogesh Deshmukh, an associate of Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik, in the Rs5,500-crore National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) money laundering case, a senior ED official has confirmed.</p><p>The alleged case is pertaining to certain plots in Guruwali, Titwala in Thane district. </p><p>These properties (plots) were allegedly purchased by Sarnaik, who is being inquired by ED in connection with the money laundering case linked to security service giant, TOPSGrup.</p><p>The plots in question are around 78 acres.

According to BMC's April 6 data (which has details till April 5), there are 73 active containment zones in the city, which includes slums and chawls, while 740 buildings remain sealed. The number of containment zones in the city is likely to go up as the civic body has decided to create micro containment zones consisting of one housing society having more than five active Covid-19 cases.</p><p>The KW ward has the 196 actively sealed buildings, the highest in the city, followed by the D ward which has 116 sealed buildings.</p><p>According to the new rules in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic, police personnel will be deployed at the entry gate of sealed buildings and no visitors will be allowed at the society which has more than five active Covid-19 cases.

We have urged the Centre to provide adequate stock and, if needed, they can delay supplies of the stock in other states as the daily cases have breached the 50,000 mark in Maharashtra,” Tope added.</p>","<p>Pune: Medical labs are seeing a rise in people seeking Covid tests following new restrictions in place which makes it mandatory for workers to get a negative RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) report. The huge demand for tests is causing delay in furnishing reports which in some cases is almost 36 hours. </p><p>While it may not lead to any delay in treatment of critical patients, it delays isolation of Covid positives and asymptomatic patients continuing to spread the infection in the community, according to public health experts. </p><p>As of March 30, Pune has 36 RT-PCR and 56 RAT (rapid antigen test) laboratories in the district. As per the presentation by the district collector to the chief secretary, government of Maharashtra, the district has conducted 2,839,453 tests, of which 519,600 are positive which takes the positivity rate to 18.3%. Of this RT-PCR has a positivity rate of 19.29% and RAT of 16.73%. </p><p>The collector in the presentation had highlighted that RT-PCR test capacity for the district needs to be increased as National Institute of Virology (NIV) and other central government labs has reduced their RT-PCR testing for district. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently made it mandatory for those in essential services to either get vaccinated or submit a negative RT-PCR report every 15 days. </p><p>Pallavi Jain, managing director, Krsnaa Diagnostics Ltd, said, “The new restrictions in place in Pune and also the surge in Covid cases are definitely leading to more demand for testing in the city. Since the sample is collected it takes between 18 and 24 hours. Also, we have been strictly asked by the administration to first provide information, including address in case of positive report, to them before sharing it with the patients. Hence, it takes another six hours. In case of critical patients, we alert the hospital. However, until the SMS is not sent through and the detailed address is not in, the sample testing is put on hold which further delays it. Shortage of staff and the cost capping by the government has further added to the delay.” </p><p>Another private city hospital lab manager said, “We have prioritised home sample collection of those bed ridden or critical patients who cannot visit us. We mostly request suspected patients to visit our nearest branch and submit the samples. We have advance booking for two days for home collection for samples and the reports come in by at least 36 hours. We have 2,200-2,300 samples pending for testing.” </p><p>Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospitals, said, “There is definitely a delay in submitting reports. In case of critical patients based on the HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) we decide the treatment line without awaiting the report. However, in case of asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms, if the results come in late then they continue to spread the infection and the chain of infection continues to grow.” </p>","<p>PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has sought the help of the Indian Army to provide beds for Covid patients in the newly constructed Southern Command hospital at Wanowrie, off Kondhwa road. Union minister Prakash Javadekar, who hails from the city, is in talks with the Army authorities as Pune is seeing record rise in virus cases. </p><p>Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said, “The city’s health infrastructure is struggling with the spike in Covid cases during the second wave. We have requested Javadekar to ask Army authorities to get beds at the new command hospital.

However, I feel at an individual school level, schools should continue taking tests so that the child builds confidence, and the doubts of the student will be clarified. This will also ensure that students know how much they have understood the syllabus as class 9 is important for concepts that are later taught in class 11 but now that the burden of exams are over, students can start focusing on Class 10 and Class 12,” said Kulkarni. </p><p>Archana Kakade, Pune-based parent whose son is in Class 11 this year said that the colleges have just started, and the first online unit test is scheduled in April. </p><p>“There is a lot of confusion and especially among Class 11 students.

In the past two months, more than 8,455.2 hectares of forest land has been destroyed due to the fire. </p><p>Himachal Pradesh frequently witnesses forest fires during the dry weather as pines shed resinous needles that are inflammable. February recorded a rain deficit of 82% and March witnessed a deficit of 62%. “Two months have been dry, and the incidents of forest fires have increased as there is less moisture on the ground and temperatures have begun rising,” state forest minister Rakesh Pathania said. </p><p>“We have roped in the fire department but dousing the blaze in the remote areas, particularly those inaccessible by road, is a challenge.

The shortfall in payment from the government to the power corporation against the power subsidy bill touched a whopping <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>6,414 crore last fiscal, which is expected to increase further in the election year (2022). </p><p>The Punjab government is giving free electricity to agricultural tubewells, 200 units of free power to Scheduled Caste (SC) families and some weaker sections of society, besides giving subsidised electricity at <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>5 per unit to industry. </p><p>As per the data compiled by the PSPCL for the 2020-21 fiscal that ended on March 31, Punjab government had paid only <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>9,986 crore against the power subsidy bill of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>16,400 crore decided by the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC), leaving a gap of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>6,414 crore. </p><p>The government paid <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>6,743 crore in cash and the remaining were book adjustments in lieu of interests of Uday Bonds, infrastructure development fee, and electricity duty that the government collects. </p><p>“Though, the government has paid more than the previous years, but it has defaulted almost 40% of the subsidy amount. For the last seven years, the default is increasing every year, forcing the PSPCL to take loans for working capital,” said a power engineer on condition of anonymity. </p><p>Officials said PSPCL chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) A Venu Parsad has taken up the matter with the finance department repeatedly, but the issue is yet to be resolved. </p><p>In fact, the arrears of last six fiscals, which amount to <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>6,500 crore (approx), had put the state government and subsequently the PSPCL under a financial stress. The power regulator had even given liberty to PSPCL to discontinue free power supply if the state government fails to pay up. However, the PSPCL never challenges the government on this account as the power subsidy is a political issue in the state, said an official. </p><p>Every year, the default amount is passed on to the next fiscal. If <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>6,414-crore arrears of this year is passed on to the next year, the power subsidy bill will stand at approximately <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>17,000 crore.

Only 30% of the cases are from rural areas which are hubs of farmer protests.” </p><p>Also, the infection positivity rate in urban areas is 2.5% while it is 1% in rural pockets. </p><p>The districts considered the hubs of farm protests, particularly those in the state’s south-west Malwa region, have the lowest cases in the state. For instance, Mansa and Barnala, which are witnessing a large number of protests and movement of farmers to Delhi, 510 and 368 cases were recorded from March 1 to April 4, much less than what many other districts are reporting in a single day. </p><p>In south-west Malwa, only Bathinda district saw more than 100 daily cases on few occasions over the past one month. </p><p>However, some doctors said testing in the villages of the belt has been inadequate as farmer unions have given call to boycott health department teams. </p><p>Dr Bhaskar denied such reports. “Testing in all districts is being monitored as they are being given targets according to the number of cases. If the spread is slow, contract tracing will be less and so will be sampling,” he said. </p><p>On Monday, 667 samples were taken in Mansa and 780 in Barnala. </p><p>Districts like Ludhiana, Mohali, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Patiala are recording the highest surge in the state. Here too, most cases are being reported in the urban areas. </p><p>Punjab Covid-19 management group head and former PGIMER, Chandigarh, director Dr KK Talwar said, “The likely reason behind less cases in rural areas is that the protests are being held in open areas. Virus is more likely to spread in indoor gatherings. In open areas, the chances of infection are less if you are in a small gathering and are wearing a mask,” said Dr Talwar. </p><p>The health department data also shows not even a single super-spreader case has surfaced at farm protests in the state in the last 3 months. The urban pockets have seen many such incidents at marriages and funerals. </p><p>In the Malwa belt, Mohali, Ludhiana and Patiala are the worst-hit districts but here too most cases were reported in urban areas, the figures show. </p>","<p>BATHINDA The Muktsar police on Monday arrested five more people for their alleged involvement in the March 27 assault on Abohar MLA of Bharatiya Janata Party, Arun Narang.</p><p>MLA Narang was gheraoed and assaulted by the activists of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) in Malout where he was to address mediapersons.</p><p>In a statement, Muktsar senior superintendent of police (SSP) D Sudarvizhi said Lakhanpal Sharma, block president of BKU (Sidhupur), who was the main leader and organiser of the protest at Malout, was among those arrested on Monday.

"They backed out upon being informed that they had to wear PPEs

Blame it on the stigma attached to the pandemic, but not a single COVID infected person came forward to cast their vote for the five Assembly constituencies here on Tuesday, for the fear of being seen in a PPE. COVID infected persons in Dharmapuri also did not cast their right to vote for the fear of stigma of being seen in a PPE.

While the disabled, and the very aged struggled their way to the polling stations to exercise their franchise, COVID patients quarantined in their homes failed to turn up at the polling stations, even as they had expressed their interest to vote. Many patients had expressed their desire to vote and had reached out to the 108 ambulance service to be picked up at the designated hour. However, they backed out at the 11th hour upon being informed that they had to wear their PPEs, says Raman Kani, District Manager, 108 GMR ambulance services.

If the home quarantined were recovering from COVID infection, their desire to vote in an election that came once in five years was trumped by perceived shame and stigma attached to the PPE and the fear of being seen in one in their neighbourhood.

For instance, in Harur, there were initially 11 COVID patients in home quarantine, who had expressed interest to vote. Later it scaled down to one person, who was supposed to be picked up at 5.30 p.m to be taken to a nearby booth at the allocated time of 6 p.m to 7 p.m for COVID infected voters. However, the patient refused at the last minute.

All polling stations were prepared to accommodate to polling of COVID patients between 6 p.m and 7 p.m and the polling staff were also clad in PPEs at the appointed hour.

“Infact, our ambulances were equipped with PPEs and our drivers were ready to pick up those interested from their homes at the appointed time. But then, they refused once they were told that they would have to wear the PPEs, which we were ready to provide,” said Mr. Raman Kani.

“For instance in Krishnagiri, we were told unofficially that there may be some 200 people interested. Then, 11 persons contacted from Krishnagiri and Hosur to be taken to the polling station. But only three persons in Hosur finally cast their votes, while seven others in Krishnagiri and Kaveripattinam refused our services,” says Mr.Kani.

The response has been different in a semi-urban Hosur, while in the rest of the rural pockets of Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri, COVID infected would rather forfeit their right to vote than to wear a PPE.","Krishnagiri only sees a marginal fall from the poll percentage of last elections

Once again, the highly literate Palayamkottai Assembly constituency, housing large number of middle, upper middle and upper class families with members drawing bulky salary from the government and private sector undertakings, failed to cast their votes and brought down the district’s poll percentage.

The Tirunelveli district recorded an overall poll percentage of 66.54 in the Assembly polls held on Tuesday. While the affluent Palayamkottai Assembly segment registered a poll percentage of just 57.76, the rural segment of Ambasamudram recorded a decent percentage of 72.05, the highest among all five Assembly constituencies of Tirunelveli district.

Other Assembly constituencies – Tirunelveli (66.90%), Nanguneri (68.60%) and Radhapuram (67.94%) – recorded a relatively decent poll percentage though not an impressive one.

Despite the ‘cent per cent polling awareness programmes’ organised by the district administration in a sustained manner and the residents of the Palayamkottai Assembly constituency have once again earned the dubious distinction of being the segment with pitiable voter turnout.

In the previous elections also – let it be 2011 Assembly election or 2016 Assembly polls - Palayamkottai Assembly constituency effectively played spoilsport in bringing down Tirunelveli district’s poll percentage.

After registering a not-so-impressive poll percentage of 68.71% in 2011 Assembly polls, Palayamkottai’s figure fell sharply to just 59.90% in the 2014 Parliamentary elections. And, the poll percentage stood at 60% in the 2016 Assembly polls. The poll percentage, the constituency has recorded in the April 6 Assembly poll is the lowest in a decade as it has registered only 57.76%.

“Even though the Tirunelveli Corporation has provided them with better basic amenities while compared with people living in Tirunelveli area, the residents of Palayamkottai Assembly constituency still keep away from this democratic process. Poll percentage in affluent areas like Maharaja Nagar, Perumalpuram, NGO Colony, Rahmath Nagar etc. is much lesser than the voter turnout in areas like Manakaavlanpillai Nagar, Samadhanapuram, Shanthi Nagar, Market areas etc. So, it is evident that it is the literate and affluent group that exerts pressure on the government always for their comfort and better amenities but who fail to cast their votes,” says Mahesh, a builder from Palayamkottai.

In Tenkasi, all the five constituencies with rural background have registered relatively good voter turn-out to take the district poll percentage to a decent 72.58. Interestingly, all the five segments have recorded 70-plus percentage voter turn-out though these constituencies house a major chunk of farmhands and beedi rollers. Alangulam, having farm labourers and beedi rollers as its electorate, has recorded a poll percentage of 77.40, which is 7.28% lesser than the previous Assembly polls held in 2016 wherein this segment recorded an enviable poll percentage of 84.68."
"The Civil Services interview (personality test) will be held from April 26 and are likely to be completed by June 18 during which 2,046 aspirants will be interviewed.

The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Wednesday announced the schedule for the personality test to be conducted for the candidates who have qualified at the Civil services Main examination.

According to the notice, 2,046 aspirants will be interviewed. Initially the interviews will be conducted for about 45 candidates daily and numbers will be progressively increased towards the concluding day. The marks scored in the interview will be added to the marks scored in the Main and the final merit list would be announced.

The allocation of services would follow after the list is announced based on the vacancies that exist in different categories.

Usually the UPSC declares the date of the commencement of the interviews along with the result. However, this year they have declared it after 15 days after the announcement of Mains results.

The dates for the interview are allocated in a random manner to achieve objectivity. The allocation is done on a variety of parameters which include reservation status, proximity of the residential location of the aspirant to Delhi among others. Gopala Krishna, Director, Brain Tree says that candidates should not harbour any doubt regarding their performance in relation to the day allotted to them for the interview. “The UPSC has a time-tested system in place and such apprehensions are unfounded. All aspirants should prepare in earnest, keeping such fears aside.”","The continuing stoppage of local suburban trains including MMTS trains from the lockdown of last year made the Suburban Train Travellers Association approach senior South Central Railway (SCR) executives to immediately start the services taking into consideration the needs of daily wage earners, vendors and general public on Wednesday.

Association general secretary Noor Ahmed Ali submitted memoranda to Assistant General Manager Arun Kumar Jain and senior officials of works, electrical and operations departments, bringing to their notice the woes of suburban passengers living in Medchal, Bolarum and Malkajgiri areas due to lack of a proper public transport system for many years.

It was pointed out that even 'DEMU' services were withdrawn from Jan.1/2019 and the MMTS Phase Two continues to be a non-starter due to the financial constraints and the government not releasing its share of the amount. Even passenger services on these sections have either been converted or cancelled with as many after considerable amounts have been spent on station buildings, extension of platforms, drinking water and toilet facilities.

In this context, Mr. Ali pointed out that Malkajgiri had been an important station right from Nizam State Railway. Many South-bound trains originate in the morning and terminate at the Kacheguda station. But, it is very difficult to reach Kacheguda as there are no connecting local trains from any corner and passengers have to depend on private transport, he said.

Railway authorities can consider running DEMU trains on Medchal-Malkajgiri-Secunderabad section or ‘modify’ the track at Sitaphalmandi to ensure that the trains are run between Sitaphalmandi-Bolarum to avoid waiting at outer signal. The plea was also to arrange halts to Ajanta, Rayalaseema, and Repalle-Kacheguda Express trains at Malkajgiri, the newly converted Kacheguda-Guntur Express can also be considered to be extended up to Medchal.

He also requested running of MMTS trains from Lingampally to Umdanagar to connect to Patancheru and Hyderabad. The demands should be considered sympathetically on humanitarian grounds for providing better, safe and fast public transportation system services for weaker section people.","Major bridge with six lanes opposite Marriott Hotel is part of the proposals

The Strategic Nala Development Plan (SNDP) wing established under the GHMC has prepared detailed proposals worth ₹858 crore for development and maintenance of storm water drainage system in the city in order to address the deficiencies and prevent flash floods.

Construction of a major bridge with six lanes on the Tank Bund opposite Marriott Hotel with an expenditure of ₹25 crore, and fixing of gates to the Hussainsagar at a cost of ₹41 crore are part of the proposals.

The State government has issued orders according administrative sanction to carrying out the works, 48 in number, divided into 15 packages.

Funding for the project may be partly borne by the government and partly financed through loans, highly placed officials informed.

The Strategic Nala Development Plan was established in the aftermath of the devastating floods during October last year when the city experienced heavy rains and breach of nalas and lake bunds.

Natural drainage

Restoration of natural drainage in the Fox Sagar lake system in Kukatpally zone is the most expensive component among the proposals, with a cost of ₹95 crore.

The works include restoration of surplus course channel of Fox Sagar, repairs to the sluice gate, and restoration of drainage between Coal Kalva and Chemical Nala, via Vennela Gadda lake.

Balkapur Nala restoration involving ₹56 crore and Afzal Sagar Nala at a cost of ₹12 crore have been proposed.

Nagamaiah Kunta nala, another critical bottleneck, will be widened from Padma Colony up to Tilaknagar Bridge via Fever Hospital with an expenditure of ₹39 crore.

Besides, bridges have been proposed between VST and Vidyanagar road, on Nagamaiah Kunta near Vegetable Market Road, at Ranigunj, near Buddha Bhavan, and on Kalasiguda Nala between Tank Bund Road and Kawadiguda.

Kalasiguda Nala will be widened up to the Hussainsagar surplus weir near Marriott Hotel with a cost of ₹20 crore, while Picket Nala will be remodelled with ₹10 crore through construction of a bridge on it at S.P.Road.

The proposals include enhanced rain water drainage on several stretches, at times requiring fresh construction too, in all six zones of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and surrounding municipalities/corporations including Meerpet, Badangpet, Jalpally, Pedda Amberpet, and Nizampet.

Storm water drainage improvement proposals include Modukula Kunta to Kotha Cheruvu in Kukatpally zone, Mansurabad Chinna Cheruvu to Bandlaguda Cheruvu and from there to Nagole Cheruvu, Bandlaguda Cheruvu to Musi river, Bathula Cheruvu to Injapur Nala, Ramanthapur Pedda Cheruvu to Ramanthapur Chinna Cheruvu up to Irrigation Canal, and four stretches in and out of Saroornagar lake up to Chaitanyapuri in Lal Bahadur Nagar Zone, Shah-Hatim Lake to Langar Houz, Nadeem Colony to Shah-Hatim lake, Masjid-e-Abubakr to Shah Hatim lake in Khairatabad zone, Errakunta to Kotha Cheruvu, and Singareni Colony to Saroornagar lake, Appa Cheruvu to Mulgund lake to Eesa River in Charminar zone, Neknampur Nala to Musi river, Eerla Cheruvu to National Highway 65, Rayasamudram to Nakka Vagu, and AG Colony to Sanath Nagar Nala in Serilingampally zone, among several others.","Affected people are from areas close to Musi river

On Tuesday, dozens of men raising slogans against Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation barged into the south zone office of the civic body. The men waved mosquito-swatting bats and demanded action against the nightly aerial menace that’s bedevilling large swathes of the city. “We cannot read, we cannot watch TV, we cannot entertain guests. Our whole focus is on killing mosquitoes and not getting bitten by them,” says Raza Abbas Zaidi, a resident of Noor Khan Bazaar, who led the protest. “We have peace only for a few hours in the daytime. Between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. we cannot step outside. We thought a new mayor will bring about some change but nothing is happening so we protested,” said Mr. Zaidi, who runs an NGO.

The complaints about mosquitoes stretch the length and breadth of the Musi river and in areas abutting lakes and nalas.

“Earlier, GHMC would carry out fogging activity every alternate day. Now there is nothing. I live near Salar Jung Museum. The whole area is covered in a cloud of mosquitoes in the evening. I think it is due to the garbage that is not being cleared regularly,” says Hyder Ali, who joined the protest on Tuesday. “Malakpet, Chanchalguda, Gowliguda, Dar-ul-Shifa, Dabeerpura and most areas in the Old City are affected by the mosquitoes,” says Mr. Ali

According to GHMC officials the unseasonal spread of mosquito menace is due to stagnant water, both indoor and outdoor. “We have 185 lakes and domestic drainage is flowing into them. We are getting complaints and we are trying to redress them. The community should take charge. If apartments and households don’t release their domestic waste into water bodies the problem can be solved,” says an entomologist of GHMC.

“We have deployed 11 drones, are cleaning up lake edges of water hyacinth, releasing gambusia fish into water bodies, desilting nalas and cleaning river Musi,” said the official listing measures of the civic body to control the menace.

The stifling heat of summer and the mosquito menace has meant that citizens cannot even keep doors and windows open.

“It's actually the first summer when the menace is this bad in the area. The mosquitoes appear to be some mutated species because no repellent is killing them. Can't even keep the doors and windows locked all the time because in this heat wave we do need some ventilation. And there's only so much relief we can find using bats,” says Maleeha Fatima, a resident of Hussaini Alam."

However, due to some technical glitches, the Co-Win portal remained open on Sunday and over 500 people reached different vaccination centres after their registration. However, they realised that it was not the fault of district health department and agreed to be vaccinated on Monday,” he said. </p><p>Tyagi further said that due to beneficiaries’ registration on Sunday and Monday, as many as 10,327 people received their jabs on Monday. “It is the highest number of vaccination in a day so far. To avert an overcrowding situation and longer waiting time, we had increased the vaccination centres in the district from 75 (on Saturday) to 83 today that included 42 government hospitals,” he said. </p><p>The last time GB Nagar had crossed the 10,000 vaccinations was April 2, when 10,111 beneficiaries were inoculated.</p><p>Meanwhile, the district, which was left with only about 8,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, received 15,000 vials of vaccines on Monday, the officials said. </p><p>GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY on Monday directed that the monitoring of all the containment zones should be intensified. “As per the new state guidelines, if one Covid-19 case comes on a floor of a multi-storey building, the entire floor will be declared as a containment zone. If more than one floor comes under scrutiny, then the entire building will be converted into a containment zone,” he said. </p><p>As per the state government’s order, containment zones are redefined for the purposes of “medical surveillance activity”. In such areas, medical teams shall track contacts of Covid-19 patients and symptomatic persons for the purposes of testing and isolation (of positive cases), so that chain of infection is broken, the officials said.</p><p>“There shall be no sealing or stopping of movement of persons. However, it is advised to the residents living in containment zones/areas to exercise self-restraint and to follow all Covid protocols,” said the DM in a statement released on Monday.</p><p>Expressing satisfaction over the work being done by home isolation cell in the integrated Covid-19 control room in sector 59, the DM said that the cell is keeping round-the-clock monitoring of health conditions of the home isolated persons. “The home isolation cell has 21 operators, four doctors and a nodal officer. They are keeping a close tab on the persons, who have recently travelled to foreign countries in the recent past. As per the cell’s records, there are altogether 283 international travellers in the district, including 236 from the United Kingdom, 26 from South Africa, 13 from Dubai, seven from Brazil and one from the USA,” Suhas said. </p><p>The additional chief medical officer, Dr Lalit Kumar, who is the nodal officer of the home isolation cell, said that at present, the district has 250 Covid-19 positive patients, who have been granted home isolation. “We call them at least thrice in a day to know their temperature, oxygen level and other symptoms. Besides, the cell receives at least 150 in-bound calls from different persons about the symptoms of Covid-19 and criteria to get permission for home isolation,” he said.</p>","<p><b>Noida:</b> Inspired by Delhi’s ‘Waste to Wonder’ theme park, the Noida authority has installed imitations of Taj Mahal, Sarnath Stupa and the river ghats of Benaras along the Mahamaya Flyover in the city. The imitations are made out of waste and are part of the ‘Waste to Art’ project of the authority, officials said. </p><p>“The authority often conducts encroachment drives across the city’s footpaths and other public places, which result in the generation of a lot of waste. All such pieces of wood shards, metal bolts and other such things have been used to create the installations,” said Anand Mohan Singh from the Noida authority’s horticulture department. </p><p>The installations were recently inspected by the authority’s chief executive officer, Ritu Maheshwari. “Some finishing touches are required at the installations. The platform of the Sarnath Stupa installation needs to be raised. I have also instructed officials to increase the number of lights that have been put inside the structures,” said Maheshwari. </p><p>The aim of the ‘Waste to Art’ project is three-pronged, said Maheshwari. “Our first aim is to project Noida as the gateway of Uttar Pradesh, so we are trying to display heritage places of the state through these structures. Secondly, we want to attract tourists to Noida and project it as an upcoming destination for investors. Thirdly, we want to promote the habit of recycling and waste management which everyone should follow in their daily lives,” she said. </p><p>She added that these installations have been designed by the same artist who created Delhi’s Waste to Wonder park. “The installations have been created as part of a company’s corporate social responsibility project,” Maheshwari said, adding that a waste to wonder park in the city is also in the pipeline. </p><p>“We are planning a theme park in Noida which will have artifacts of UP’s heritage sites made out of waste. However, the project is still in its initial stages and will take another two-three months to materialise,” she said. </p><p>The Noida CEO added that 10 more such installations are being planned along the Noida-Greater Noida expressway as well. “We have planned 10 more such installations depicting tourist and heritage sites of UP to be installed along the Noida expressway. We are looking for firms to come forward and take those up as part of their CSR,” she said. </p>","<p><b>Ghaziabad:</b> Thousands of commuters are facing a tough time for the last two days as a stretch of the CISF Road in Indirapuram has got overflooded due to the damage to a Ganga water pipeline in the area. Officials of the Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) said that the repair work is in progress and likely to get over by Tuesday. </p><p>The CISF Road helps commuters from Vasundhara and Mohan Nagar reach NH-9. </p><p>The carriageway from Vasundhara to NH-9 is already dug up due to a 2.5km pipeline laying project undertaken by the UP Jal Nigam since February last year and the road relaying work is likely to get complete by end of May. </p><p>“Commuters were already facing issues with the dug-up road, and now they are suffering due to damage to the Ganga water pipeline which has overflooded a stretch of about 400 metres. As a result, residents of our high-rise have no exit left while vehicles often get stuck up on the flooded road,” said Kapil Tyagi, president of apartment owners association at Divyansh Pratham, a high-rise in Indirapuram. </p><p>Residents said that the dug-up road and the recent damage to the water pipeline have compounded their problems. “We are not able to understand why the dug-up road is not being re-laid for over a year now. The water pipeline damage has further compounded problems. Thousands of vehicles are forced to use the other side of the CISF Road, resulting in snarls during peak hours,” said BK Pandey, a resident of Vaishali who works in Indirapuram. </p><p>Under the Jal Nigam’s project, the newly laid pipeline will take the treated water from three sewage treatment plants in Indirapuram to river Hindon. </p><p>Officials of GDA said that they have deployed teams to repair the damaged Ganga water pipeline. “It is likely that we will repair the damaged water pipeline by Tuesday morning. The damaged pipeline, however, has not hampered the water supply in the area,” said AK Chaudhary, executive engineer of GDA. </p><p>Officials of the UP Jal Nigam said that the work for repair of the dug-up road is held up due to pending payments. “The payment is pending on account of share of local body which is the Ghaziabad municipal corporation. However, we have asked the contractor to get the road re-laid,” said Keshav Kumar, chief engineer of UP Jal Nigam. </p><p>When asked, MS Tanwar, municipal commissioner, said, “The decision has been made about the payment to the Jal Nigam’s pipeline project at CISF Road. The payment will be released soon.”</p><p>The project has been taken up under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme and proposed for laying pipeline of about 2.5km in length. </p>","<p>GREATER NOIDA: Expediting the process to acquire land for the second phase of the Noida International Airport at Jewar, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration decided to notify Section 4 of the Land Act on Wednesday, which initiates the social impact assessment.</p><p>The provisions of the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, state that the concerned agency can take two-six months to carry out the survey and submit the report.

Once the assessment is done, Section 11 of Act will be implemented, inviting objections from the public, after which the government will implement Section 19 and compensation will be decided and distributed to land owners, as per rules.</p><p>To be used for the third runway and commercial MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul work of airplanes) centre, the six villages for which the survey will be taken up are Karauli Bangar, Dayanat Pur, Kureb, Ranhera, Birampur and Mundera as part of the second phase of construction. About 1,185 hectare of private land has to be acquired from these. Under the first phase, 1,334 hectares was acquired on which the work is likely to begin at the ground by mid-2021.</p><p>“The state-owned Gautam Buddha University, which has conducted the assessment in the past, is likely to start the survey work this week. The study is a mandate under the Act in order to find out how many people will be losing their agricultural land, properties and livelihood. The assessment team will also have to ascertain how many people will lose livelihood in an indirect manner due to the acquisition,” said Balram Singh, additional district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.</p><p>The acquisition will require almost <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,891 crore, for which the administration has already received <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,084 crore from Uttar Pradesh government. The remaining amount has to be arranged by the Noida, Greater Noida, and Yamuna Expressway authorities.</p><p>Out of the 1363 hectare of land needed for the second phase, 1,185 hectare which is to be acquired is privately owned. The remaining land is already owned by the state government.</p><p>Besides this, the Uttar Pradesh government has approved <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>22 crore for the construction and development of religious and other recreational structures which will be displaced due to the acquisition under phase 1.</p><p>Officials said farmers are shifting into a newly-developed airport township at the Jewar Bangar area. They said the farmers, who are getting residential plots in this township, had been demanding religious and cultural places. The land, on which almost 30 religious structures stand, across communities, will be acquired once construction activity begins under phase 1. Apart from temples and mosques, multiple small religious shrines, Eidgah, Ambedkar sthals and one madarsa will be developed.

The issue had come to the fore on March 25 after a video purportedly showing starving or dead cattle went viral on social media, after which several animal rights activists had rushed to the shelter with fodder and medical supplies. Activists alleged that the officials arranged food and medicines only after “being exposed”.</p><p>Activists who had visited the shelter, which is run by the authority, had alleged that starvation and absence of proper medical facilities were the main reasons behind the animal deaths. They had also alleged that at least 20 bovines died between March 24 and 25, and that dozens had died earlier and their bodies were disposed of. However, authority officials had claimed that only six bovines had died due to injuries, or due to polythene consumption.</p><p>The authority also named a vet and an engineer, and the in-charge of the shelter and a compounder, of the authority in the case filed under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections 201, 409, 429, 34 and 120B, and relevant sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.</p><p>The arrested persons were identified as Sheetal Prakash Tiwari, supervisor, Satendra Kumar, compounder, Dr Prem Chand, vet, and Ramesh Chandra, engineer.

The sequence began with a three-day visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Azamgarh in eastern Uttar Pradesh in December.</p><p>During these visits, he has addressed cadre training camps, kisan mahapanchayats, public meetings and press conferences. He has also gone to temples, besides Muslim and Buddhist places of worship.</p><p>At all the districts, Akhilesh posted pictures of him amid the dense crowds on his social media accounts. Most of them were road trips but he did use an aeroplane on a couple of visits, including one to Chitrakoot.</p><p>In Etawah, he addressed a gathering from atop a tractor. He also stood on the roof of his rath (a luxury election campaign bus) at his Aligarh kisan mahapanchayat. In Rampur, he not only flagged off the 350-km-long Samajwadi Cycle Yatra to Lucknow, but also pedalled the first 10 km of the route along with party workers. He even travelled on a UP roadways bus on the way to Etawah.</p><p>“The way crowds are gathering indicates how restive the people are to vote the BJP out and bring back the Samajwadi Party,” said SP state spokesperson and former minister Rajendra Chaudhary.</p><p>The tours have also quelled the criticism that he earlier did not hit the streets the way his father and party founder Mulayam Singh Yadav did when he led the party.</p><p>Keeping his attack focused only on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Akhilesh Yadav never spoke about any other rival political party, be it the Congress or the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).</p><p>Among his political rivals, BSP chief Mayawati has not travelled across the state at all, while Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited a few districts such as Saharanpur and Mathura. She is likely to go to four eastern UP districts to address kisan mahapanchayats in Varanasi, Mirzapur, Sonbhadra, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur this month.</p><p>“It is good that Akhilesh Yadav is doing such hectic tours and engaged in taking on the BJP much ahead of the polls. There is no other way, if he and his party have to fight the BJP and aspire to win back power. As of now, it is only his party and he who are in a position to take on BJP well. Such hard work and some strategic alliances, if he does them, would certainly help in the fight,” said Prof SK Dwivedi, a political analyst and former head of the department of political science, Lucknow University.</p><p>Dwivedi added: “Before this, his solo Kranti Rath tour of the state in 2011 shortly before the 2012 UP assembly elections is still etched in public memory.”</p><p>Mulayam had credited Akhilesh Yadav and his Kranti Rath campaign for making the SP win a full majority for the first time in its electoral history.

The lack of clarity over the interest rates meant that homebuyers could not get their flats registered. </p><p>“Now we may take the proposal (of new rates and affidavit) submitted by the developers on board for a decision. And we will follow the directions taken in the board in future,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority. </p><p>Builders welcomed the order.</p><p>“Following the SC order, it will benefit around 20,000 flat buyers, and developers,” said RK Arora, Uttar Pradesh president of national real estate Developers Corporation.</p><p>On July 10, 2020 the Supreme Court, while hearing petitions in a matter regarding the Amrapali Group, directed Noida Authority to only charge an interest rate of 8.5%, as per the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) on land cost, fixed by the Reserve Bank of India, on land dues of developers. The order came in response to Noida-based developer ACE Group, through a plea, demanded that the “unreasonable” interest rate on group housing land should be looked into. ACE Group’s plea was clubbed with the Amrapali case. However the authority is yet to settle the financial issues of the developers in the light of the SC order because it has challenged the SC order in the Apex court. The SC will hear the authority plea challenging decision on interest on April 12. The developers had requested that the authority should calculate financial dues as per SC order with 8.5% until further decision is taken by the SC. The Noida authority had sought approvals from the UP government on this demand.</p>","<p> Four villages in Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area said they would oppose the Ghaziabad administration’s attempts to divert Delhi-Kaushambi traffic through their area. Residents there say that the plan would further pollute the villages.</p><p>The plan was drawn up in response to a Supreme Court (SC) directive last month on the plea of Kaushambi residents. The court had then ordered the formation of a nine-member committee whose nodal officer would be the Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) Ajay Shankar Pandey. The committee had members from the district administration, district police and Delhi officials.</p><p>It proposed that the traffic, including UP Roadways buses, be diverted through Saur Urja Marg.</p><p>The four-laned Saur Urja Marg is about 7-8kms stretch and connects near Kaushambi ISBT to Vasundhara intersection and passes through Sahibabad Site IV Industrial Area, which the central pollution control board had identified as an air pollution hot spot.</p><p>But residents of four villages, Kadkad Model, Maharjpur, Sahibabad and Jhandapur, feel that the plan would affect them badly.</p><p>Sushil Raghav, a city-based environmentalist and resident of Kadkad Model, said, “The industrial area is already polluted, and diversion of buses and vehicles will further intensify the problem. It is just an attempt to give relief to Kaushambi at our expense. We have sent representation to UP chief secretary and other officers and we will move Supreme Court if traffic is diverted through our area.”</p><p>“The industrial area already has vehicles which remain parked on roads and if the plan is cleared, more vehicles will be diverted here and compound the issue. This will also increase risk of accidents for cyclists, children and daily commuters,” said Haji Arif, resident of Maharajpur one of the four villages . </p><p>The four villages together have a population of around 300,000 to 400,000.</p><p>“The latest plan including suggestions from UP and Delhi is only a draft and not a final plan,” said district magistrate Pandey. “Saur Urja Marg is proposed for diversion of buses. However, if residents have any issues, we will give them time and invite public objection for resolution of their issues.”</p><p>In the plan, the authorities have also proposed enforcement against illegal buses and autos, removal of encroachment, regulation of permits of autos and e-rickshaws besides diversions and other traffic infrastructure measures in order to decongest and abate polluted surroundings at Kaushambi. They have also proposed parking spaces and a multi-level parking at Kaushambi metro station. </p><p>The Supreme Court’s March 24 order was in response to Kaushambi residents welfare association (Karwa) that said the pollution in their area, which is close to two inter state bus terminals, had to be controlled. </p><p>VK Mittal, president of Karwa, said that he could not comment over the issue of Saur Urja Marg. </p><p>“If the residents of four villages have plan, they can move court with their issue. It is up to the court to decide their issue. Regarding the latest plan, we have issues and will submit our comments before the court,” he said.</p>","<p><b>Greater Noida:</b> A 25-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly killing his friend after an argument over some issue almost two weeks ago in Dankaur. </p><p>The suspect was identified as Bunty, a resident of Junedpur in Dankaur.

We further investigated the matter and found that Omveer was Bunty’s friend. He was then picked up for questioning,” he said. </p><p>During interrogation, Bunty revealed that he, along with his accomplice Shaukeen and Omveer, were consuming liquor in the jungle. During the drinks, they had an argument over some issue, police said. </p><p>“Bunty and Shaukeen strangulated Omveer to death with a towel and then dumped his body. They also fled on the victim’s motorcycle and parked it somewhere else,” the additional DCP said, adding that police have launched a search for the absconding suspect. </p><p>Anil Kumar Pandey, station house officer of Dankaur police station, said Bunty and Omveer had no personal enmity. “It appears that he committed the crime under influence of alcohol. Police have recovered the towel used in the crime.

UP government in consonance with the central government took a holistic approach towards addressing the crisis, the study said. </p><p>Besides providing buses and train services for stranded migrants, the state government also arranged transportation facilities for within-state travel and made efforts to publicise the schemes of the government that can help migrants in the time of such crisis. </p><p>The state government collaborated with Indian railways and arranged 1604 trains and brought back over 21 lakh migrants through Shramik trains i.e. 80 percent of the total migrants who returned to the state. </p><p>The state government managed to bring back thousands of migrant workers from Delhi within a time span of 24 hours after the borders were sealed on March 28, 2020. Also, round-the-clock free buses were made available for migrants wanting to travel within the state. </p><p>The state government followed a three-step approach for outbreak prevention – thermal screening, quarantine, and isolation. The health department formed more than 90,000 screening teams to screen the migrants and other persons, their relatives, and acquaintances if they came in contact with them. </p><p>The state government also set up as many as 18140 quarantine facilities as per the guidelines issued by National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and a total of 15.15 lakh migrants were quarantined at different points in time. The third step was isolation and testing of the migrants with suggestive symptoms. </p><p>The state government developed two types of ration kits: 15-day ration kit and 7-day ration kit for the migrants. Over 20.67 lakh families availed of these benefits out of which 16.35 lakh were provided with the 15-day ration kit. It established community kitchens. </p><p>Also, a total of <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>1,51,82,67,000 has been transferred to 15.18 lakh migrants’ account. </p><p>The state government devised a three-tier system (L1, L2, and L3) to deal with suspected and positive cases of COVID-19 in the state. By June 23, 2020, a total of 403 L1 hospitals, 75 L2 hospitals, and 25 L3 hospitals had been fully set up in the state. </p><p>The state government also formulated long-term plans to build economic opportunities for migrants closer to home using existing schemes as well as by signing new MoUs.

"<p>Taking suo moto cognisance of the alarming forest fires in the state, Uttarakhand High Court on Tuesday summoned principal chief convertor of forests (PCCF) Rajiv Bhartari to explain the preparedness of the state forest department and measures that have been taken over the years. The PCCF has been directed to attend the meeting on Wednesday through video-conferencing. </p><p>Dushyant Mainali, an advocate, said he had mentioned the raging forest in the state before the HC on Monday, following which the court took cognisance and heard the matter on Tuesday. </p><p>“The court said it understands that measures are being taken now, but what about the preparedness and measures taken before the forest fires to check them. The PCCF will have to explain this to the court at 10 am during the hearing on Wednesday through video-conferencing”, he said. </p><p>Mainali said he also submitted various documents and media reports, including one by HT, before the court. “The court also expressed its concern over the smoke that is emanating from the forest fires and affecting the locals, especially during Covid times when many patients face breathing problems,” he said. </p><p><b>Also read: <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-forest-minister-posts-video-fighting-forest-fire-with-twigs-slammed-101617711799524.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Uttarakhand forest minister posts video fighting forest fire with twigs, slammed</a></b></p><p>Mainali said he also raised the issue of the 2004 state government order that had talked about community participation on a major level through van panchayats for checking forest fires in the state. </p><p>This is not the first time when the courts have expressed their concerns about forest fires in the state. Taking cognisance of the raging forest fires in the state in 2016, when over 4,400 hectares of forest land had been damaged, the HC had directed the state to appoint at least 10,000 fire watchers to keep a tab on forest fire incidents and check them.</p><p>In May 2018, the HC while taking suo moto cognisance of the forest fires in the state, directed the state government to submit the details of the forest fires, the kind of damage and the steps taken by the government to prevent them. In its response, the state government informed the HC that 90% of the forest fires in the state were “manmade”. Surprised, the HC remarked, “We were very shocked to hear the reply of the government. How is it possible when people have migrated from thousands of villages, they have a role in 90% of the forest fires in the state”. </p><p>In June 2019, a public interest litigation (PIL) on forest fires in Uttarakhand highlighted that forest fires were wiping out entire species of birds, small insects and animals. The PIL, filed in the Supreme Court by a Tehri Garhwal-based advocate, stated that carbon dioxide emitted from the fires was causing heat in the hills resulting in a faster meltdown of glaciers, besides causing pollution and ecological imbalance. </p><p>The PIL sought urgent steps to protect/safeguard the forests, wildlife and birds from the forest fires in Uttarakhand and also efforts to ensure the right to a healthy environment. </p><p>Since the beginning of this year, Uttarakhand has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents that have damaged around 1,540 hectares of forest land. Till Monday evening, there were over 85 forest fires raging in the state’s hill districts, that damaged over 165 acres of forest land in the previous 24 hours. Of the 1,130 forest fire incidents reported, the maximum (269) were reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, data provided by the state forest department states. </p><p>From 2000 to April 5 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires. </p><p>Forest fire activity is generally reported from February to June, with a peak in fire incidence in May and June. Besides man-made, other reasons for forest fires in the state include lightning, friction from falling rocks, among others. </p>","<p>At least 85 forest fires are raging in Uttarakhand, and have destroyed 165 acres of land in the past 24 hours to 48 hours, forcing the state to seek the Centre’s intervention — two helicopters of the Indian Air Force were pressed into service Monday, and they flew several sorties to spray water over the fires — even as it became clear that the state, with a forest cover of 71% of its area, still does not have an effective strategy to deal with forest fires.</p><p>Since 2000 to April 4 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires. And, the first few days of April 2021 has seen the worst forest fires in the past one decade with the state government grappling to control the damage.</p><p>Major forest fires are raging in at least 40 places in the state even as chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat said that around 12,000 forest workers were deployed and 1,300 fire crew stations were set up to douse the flames, which have so far claimed six lives and led to death of several animals.</p><p>Forest department officials on Monday said that the fires were spreading to new areas because of the hot weather conditions and strong winds. According to India Meteorological Department, Uttarakhand has received 70% less rainfall than normal in March and there has not been a single rainy day in April, thereby providing perfect dry conditions for the fire to spread.</p><p>Since January, the state has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents, which in total ravaged 1,540 hectares of forest land, the highest since all of 2018.</p><p>On Sunday, in an emergency meeting, Rawat admitted the need for a long-term plan to check fires. He directed the officials to seek the help of van panchayats and local people in checking forest fires, and set up fire control rooms and fire stations at tehsil and block levels.</p><p>At the ground level, when a forest fire occurs, there are three ways in which it can be doused. Using water, soil, or beating the forest fire with branches. As water is not available on hill slopes where forests catch fire and it is not practical or even possible to collect soil, the only way available to locals and forest officials is to beat the advancing forest fires with tree branches.</p><p>But when the forest fires are raging, such methods are not of much help. There are also fire lines or spaces created in forests, which helps to check the spread of fires. But given the huge area under forests in the state, such lines also prove ineffective in most cases. Uttarakhand has a forest area of over 38,000 sq km, which constitutes 71% of the total geographical area of the state.</p><p>Experts say the only effective way to deal with forest fires is getting locals involved to ensure that: one, such fires aren’t man-made; and two, when fires start, enough people are mobilised to fight them.</p><p>But for that, the locals need to be made aware of how they will benefit.</p><p>Ajay Singh Rawat, an environmentalist, said dousing forest fires should be a people’s movement and such fires should be declared as a national disaster.</p><p>Maan Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department, said that the real issue isn’t strategy but the enormity of the challenge.</p><p>“The main challenge in hilly areas is how to douse the fire when no water is available. So, most locals try to check the advance of forest fires by beating it with big branches. We also go for routine cleaning of the forest lines. But as forests are huge, we don’t know where the fires will start,” he said.</p>","<p>Amid the raging forest fire in Uttarakhand which has affected over 1300 hectares of area, state forest and wildlife minister Harak Singh Rawat has drawn flak over a video, in which he and his aide are seen trying to douse a forest fire with what appeared to be a shrub or a stem.</p><p>The Congress and Aam Aadmi Party said the video and stills shared on social media by the minister’s close aides were “mere publicity stunt”.</p><p>“When the forest fire was raging, then the forest minister was nowhere to be seen. But now, when the choppers of the Indian Air Force (IAF) have arrived to fight the situation, he has now come up with a publicity stunt,” said Congress state president Pritam Singh, who earlier said the BJP led state government was “doing nothing” to control the forest fire.</p><p>“Forests are Uttarakhand’s most precious assets after the Himalayas. And the lethargic response of the minister to such a serious situation shows this government doesn’t care about the forest of our state,” Singh said.</p><p>Earlier on Monday, two Mi-17 helicopters reached Uttarakhand to help in fighting the forest fires which have so far affected about 1,300 hectares of forest area and claimed four human lives. Currently over 85 forest fires are raging in hill districts. This year since January 1, the state has reported 1,130 forest fire incidents, in which 1540 hectares of forest land has been damaged. Of these 1,130 forest fire incidents, the maximum 269 have been reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 116 in Tehri, 100 in Bageshwar, 94 in Pithoragarh, 93 in Almora, according to the data provided by the state forest department. Since 2000 to April 4 this year, the hill state has lost 49,231 hectares of forest land to forest fires.</p><p>“When the people were sharing videos and photographs of the forest fire incidents on social media, urging the government to take note of the situation urgently, the minister didn’t pay any heed. Now, instead of taking concrete steps to control it and prevent it in future, he decides to come up with this ridiculous video just for publicity,” said Amarjit Singh, spokesperson of Aam Aadmi Party in Uttarakhand.</p><p>Minister Rawat however, couldn’t be contacted for a comment till the filing of the story.</p>","<p>Five student hostels at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee in Uttarakhand have been sealed and declared containment zones after 60 students tested positive for Covid-19 over a span of two days, said IIT officials. </p><p>Fifty-four students were detected positive on Monday followed by six more on Tuesday evening. The institute has asked students not to return from home to hostels till further orders. </p><p>“After the 60 students were tested positive in the institute, five hostels named Korle, Kasturba, Sarojini, Govind Bhavan and Vigyan Kunj have been sealed and declared containment zones by the Haridwar district health department. The institute at present has about 3,000 students, of which, about 1,200 are in these five hostels,” said IIT Roorkee media cell in-charge Sonika Srivastava. </p><p>She said all the students of the above-mentioned hostels have been asked to remain inside their rooms, where they were being provided with food and other requirements. </p><p>“The institute has turned its Ganga Bhavan hostel as the Covid care centre for treating infected students under the supervision of district health department. Apart from this, one guest house and another in-house establishment have been turned into quarantine centres for the first contacts of the infected students,” she said, and added that a committee has been formed to handle and manage the Covid-19 situation. </p><p>Uttarakhand on Tuesday recorded its highest daily spike this year with 791 Covid-19 cases, taking the infections’ tally in the state to 1,03,602. With seven more deaths, Covid-19 death toll reached 1,736, a mortality rate of 1.68%.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hand over a ‘Fast Petrol Vessel’ to the Seychelles Coast Guard on Thursday. The handing over will be part of a high-level virtual interaction between the Indian leader and the President of Seychelles, Wavel Ramkalawan.

This is the first interaction between the two leaders since Mr. Ramkalawan won the October 2020 elections in Seychelles. The African archipelago nation has been a steady part of India’s policy for the Indian Ocean region and Mr. Modi visited the country in 2015. India gifted similar vessels to the Seychelles in 2005, 2014 and 2016.

During the event, the leaders will inaugurate a 1 MW solar power plant, and the Magistrates’ Court building project in Mahe, the largest island in the archipelago.

"Britain should not giveOxford/AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine to under 30s wherepossible, Britain's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) said on Wednesday, due to a very rare side-effect of blood clots in the brain.

Wei Shen Lim, COVID-19 Chair for JCVI, said that based on the available data and evidence, the committee has advised that it is preferable for adults aged under 30 with no underlying conditions to be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine where available.

He said that for younger people, where the risks of hospitalisation were much lower, the risk/benefit calculation of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot meant others vaccines were preferable.

""We are not advising a stop to any vaccination for any individual in any age group. We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group,really out of the utmost caution, rather than because we have any serious safety concerns,"" Mr. Lim said at a briefing.

He said people should continue to have a second dose of the AstraZeneca shot if they had received a first dose.

It came after Britain's MHRA medicine regulator identified a possible side-effect from the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca involving rare brain blood clotting.

Chief executive June Raine said that the benefits of the shot outweighed the risks for the vast majority, echoing an update from Europe's medicine regulator also made on Wednesday.

Europe's and Britain's medicine regulators have both previously said that there is no increased risk of blood clots in general from the shot developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca.

However, both have been investigating small numbers of reports of a brain blood clots, know as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that have occurred in combination with unusually low blood platelet levels after people have been given the shot.

Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam said the move would have only a negligible impact on the pace of Britain's vaccine rollout.

The rollout of Moderna's shot began on Wednesday,while Britain is also deploying Pfizer's vaccine","China has been holding ‘combat-type’ drills closer to island

The American military is warning that China is probably accelerating its timetable for capturing control of Taiwan, the island democracy that has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.

The worry about Taiwan comes as China wields new strength from years of military buildup. It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington; senior Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in talks in Alaska last month.

Tough choice

A military move against Taiwan, however, would be a test of U.S. support for the island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. For the Biden administration, it could present the choice of abandoning a friendly, democratic entity or risking what could become an all-out war over a cause that is not on the radar of most Americans. The U.S. has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack.

This accumulation of concerns meshes with the administration’s view that China is a frontline challenge for the U.S. and that more must be done soon — militarily, diplomatically and by other means — to deter Beijing.

“We have indications that the risks are actually going up,” Adm. Philip Davidson, the most senior U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate panel last month, referring to a Chinese move on Taiwan. “The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” he said.

On Wednesday, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the military threat against his country is increasing, and while he said it was not yet “particularly alarming,” the Chinese military in the last couple of years has been conducting what he called “real combat-type” exercises closer to the island."

At an ongoing exhibition titled Narayani, organised by the Lalit Kala Akademi and the French Institute in India, there are artworks that celebrate ‘generation equality’. </p><p>Artists participating in the show are from both India and abroad, namely Aishwarya Sultania (India), Arpana Caur (India), Carol Diver (Ireland), Dimple B Shah (India), Gayatri Apte (India), Germander Speedwell (UK), Gauri Vemula (India), Iva Saric (Croatia), Kanchan Chander (India), Kavita Nayar (India), Laura Napier (USA), Marija Lopac (Croatia), Noriko Matsubara (Japan), Rathi Devi (India), Rini Dhumal (India), Stephanie Arpels (France), Vasudha Thozure (India).</p><p>“India takes a back seat when we talk about ‘feminism’ and ‘equality’,” says Gayatri Mathur, curator of the exhibition, adding, “In our sector too, as artists we aren’t treated at par. In this exhibition, I wanted to showcase the brilliance of women artists with a focus on their journey and craft, and not gender. The name of the exhibition is an ode to the goddess Narayani, who is the amalgamation of – Mahalaxmi, Durga and Saraswati – the three goddesses who are embodiment of wealth, strength and knowledge. These aspects, every woman has in herself, and this was the driving force behind the collaborative effort.” </p><p>Delhi-based artist Kanchan Chander, whose work featuring a torso of a woman is displayed at the show, says she was enamoured by the beauty of the Tribhanga pose. “My artwork conveys everything about womanhood including her fertility and her sensuousness. I didn’t want to identify the woman, or put a head and arms on the figure. In our sculptures, the Tribhanga pose is the epitome of grace of an Indian woman, and that was the inspiration behind the painting, which I have done on the canvas using acrylic, oil and metallic leaf.”</p><p>Another participating artist, Aishwarya Sultania, from Gandhinagar, has a painting featuring the Gayatri mantra on Nandi the sacred bull and God Shiva’s vahan. She has used ink and mirrors, a self-developed technique, for her work, and explains, “The mantra is very auspicious for us, and the depiction of it on Nandi is a culmination of the inspiration from various gods and goddesses, a form of Shakti.” </p><p><b>Catch It Live </b></p><p>What: Narayani Where: Galerie Romain Rolland, Alliance Française, 72, Lodhi Estate On till: April 16 Timing: 11am to 6pm Nearest Metro Station: Jor Bagh on Yellow Line and JLN Stadium on Violet Line </p><p><b>Author tweets <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">@bhagat_mallika</a></b></p><p><b>Follow more stories on <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bhagat_mallika"" title=""twitter.com"">Twitter</a></b></p>","<p>Hate Ora has been weaving carpets and rugs for more than half a century, since learning the <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle"" target=""_blank"">craft</a> as a child by sneaking into her aunt's workshop.</p><p>Ora, 64, is now teaching the methods she picked up and perfected to her daughter, nieces and other younger women to ensure there is another generation of artisans to continue the tradition.</p><p>Albania once had 13 former state-run factories that produced carpets, rugs, fez hats, folk costumes and other handicrafts. Kukes, a town northeast of the capital, Tirana, alone employed more than 1,200 women as weavers. When the country's communist era ended in 1990, the local factory closed.</p><p>Ora built herself three looms and bought a big supply of wool fibers and other needed tools in the chaotic aftermath. Today, she is one of only a few Albanians still doing weaving work, which doesn’t bring in much money. Kukes, a town of about 60,000 residents, is one of the poorest in Albania, which itself is one of the poorest countries in Europe.</p><p>Many of the town’s young people, especially the young men, have emigrated to Western Europe in search of jobs. Women often remain unemployed at home, waiting for remittances from their husbands, brothers and other male relatives.</p><p>“Resuming this tradition would be an added value, increasing employment and having a direct social and economic impact on the people’s lives” along with preserving a piece of Albanian culture, Deputy Mayor Majlinda Onuzi said.</p><p>A non-governmental organization, Social Development Investment, has received money from German and Swiss development agencies to train 125 women in wool production and weaving. Founder Elias Mazloum said the purpose is to “open a window of hope for unemployed people"" in the Kukes area and to keep the tradition of handmade carpet-making alive.</p><p>As part of the program, Ora is both teaching young people how to weave wool from the area's Ruda sheep into carpets and other items using Persian knots, the local method preferred over Turkish-style knots. She herself is learning how to clean, wash, comb and color the wool with vegetable and other natural dyes.</p><p>Ora said other efforts to revive the carpet industry have failed in Kukes “because to be successful they have to employ all the qualified women and find the market for our products.”</p><p>“Unless the whole carpet-weaving industry resumes, me, or any other like me, can hardly attract individually Tirana’s attention, where all business and the market is located,” she said.</p><p>Mazloum said the new program trains participants to produce product for which there already is a buyer. At least half of the women in the program have started wool-working at home, he said.</p><p>“It’s a very difficult job, but it is not priced with the real value. It’s underpriced, if you take into consideration the time and how difficult this job is,” Mazloum said.</p><p>Blerina Kolgjini, an associate professor of textiles and fashion at Albania's Tirana University, points out the artistry in the rugs and other products displayed at a gallery in Kukes: the quality of the Ruda sheep wool found only in that area, Kosovo and Croatia, the density of the knots, the thread thickness and the attention to detail “not much different from worldwide painters’ work.”</p><p>Kolgjini says carpets and other wool products were Albania’s second-most exported goods before communism ended. The items produced there were of such high quality that an Italian company would buy and resell them in Europe for 10 times the price while saying they were made in Iran, a country prized for its carpetmaking, she said.</p><p>“Shepherds produce the wool, and craftswomen weave its threads. What Albania is now missing is the in-between step of yarn processing, the spinning mill,” she said.</p><p>A study by Mazloum’s NGO found that 85% of the country’s sheared wool is thrown away, creating a potential annual loss of 20 million euros ($24 million). In the village of Nange, not far from Kukes, 68-year old Mereme Pepa is the only one still spinning the wool she uses to crochet sweaters, blouses and socks.</p><p>Her grandson, Ernest, and a few of his high school classmates, are taking part in the Social Development Investment training program. At first, they attended for fun, but some of the girls enjoyed it enough to want to learn the craft, “not wanting it to be lost and let foreigners do what we can do ourselves,” said the teenager.</p><p>Ora excitedly described how she learned to weave by “stealing” her aunt's methods and how she helped support her parents during the communist era by making carpets and then her own family of five during the still-difficult post-communist years.</p><p>Even before the training program started, she taught her daughter to make carpets, too. Ora's daughter-in-law, a nurse, helps out part-time as her main assistant. A 23-year-old niece who is studying industrial chemistry also assists and sometimes brings friends and women she knows from school who are eager to learn from Aunt Hate, the name (pronounced HAY-tee) that everyone in the town calls Ora.</p><p>It takes the experienced weaver three months to complete a rug with an image of Mother Teresa or an elaborate arrangement of Albanian symbols.</p><p>“Why doesn’t a businessman or the government turns the eyes on us,” she pleads. ”We do artwork, don’t we?”</p><p>___</p><p>This story corrects name to Mother Teresa, not Theresa.</p>","<p>A new documentary on Ernest Hemingway — powered by vast but little-known archives kept at the John F. Kennedy Presidential <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle"" target=""_blank"">Library</a> and Museum in Boston — is shedding new light on the acclaimed novelist.</p><p>“Hemingway,” by longtime collaborators Ken Burns and Lynn Novick, premiering on PBS on three consecutive nights starting April 5, takes a more nuanced look at the author and his longstanding reputation as an alcoholic, adventurer, outdoorsman and bullfight-loving misogynist who struggled with internal turmoil that eventually led to his death by suicide at age 61.</p><p>The truth about the man many consider America’s greatest 20th-century novelist — whose concise writing style made him an outsized celebrity who became a symbol of unrepentant American masculinity — is much more complex, Novick said.</p><p>“We hope this film opens up opportunities to look at Hemingway in different ways,” said Novick, who has co-created several other documentaries with Burns including “The Vietnam War” and “Prohibition.” “There is a complexity beneath the surface.”</p><p>That complexity would have been nearly impossible to detail without the largest-in-the-world Hemingway collection that ended up at the JFK Library, thanks to Hemingway's and Kennedy's widows.</p><p>Although the two men never met, they admired each other and corresponded briefly. Hemingway was even invited to Kennedy’s inauguration but couldn’t make it because of illness, said Hilary Justice, the Hemingway scholar in residence at the library.</p><p>When Hemingway’s fourth wife, Mary Hemingway, was figuring out what to do with her late husband’s effects, she asked Jackie Kennedy if they could be housed at the JFK Library.</p><p>The archives contain Hemingway’s manuscripts — including “The Sun Also Rises"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls” — personal correspondence and about 11,000 photographs.</p><p>Much of the material used in the documentary has not been widely seen in public, if at all, Novick said.</p><p>Burns had been to the JFK Library on multiple occasions for several functions, but had no idea about the extent of the Hemingway archives until they started researching the film, which has been in the works for years.</p><p>“The Hemingway collection was central to the process,” Burns said. “It helped us understand just what a disciplined writer he was.”</p><p>Much of the documentary deals with Hemingway’s complicated relationship with the women in his life, from his mother and sisters to the nurse he fell love with while recovering from wounds suffered in World War I to his four wives.</p><p>“So much of what he did in life was about love: running to it, running from it and ruining it,” Burns said.</p><p>While considered the archetype of American manhood, the truth about Hemingway's masculinity was more complex, the filmmakers found.</p><p>As a child, Hemingway’s mother treated him and one of his sisters as twins, often dressing them in identical outfits, sometimes as boys, sometimes as girls. He explored gender fluidity both in his books and in life, letting his hair grow as his wives cropped theirs short.</p><p>“We wanted to push back against this idea that Hemingway didn't like women,"" Novick said.</p><p>Novick's favorite part of the collection were Hemingway's manuscripts, many handwritten on store-bought notebooks. They show in great detail his thinking process as he wrote, rewrote, amended and edited his works through cross-outs, scribbles and notes in the margins.</p><p>Hemingway, for example, wrote dozens of endings to “A Farewell to Arms” — as many as 47, according to one count. “You can trace how each work developed, from first draft to final manuscript,” she said.</p><p>For Burns, the most striking thing about the collection are the pieces of shrapnel dug from Hemingway's body after he was almost killed as a teenager driving a Red Cross ambulance in World War I. Burns can't help but think that such a profound near-death experience had a major impact on the rest of Hemingway's life, and contributed to his death.</p><p>Whether you’re a Hemingway aficionado, or know virtually nothing about him, there is something in the series for you, Novick said. “There’s a huge amount to be learned and new interpretations of his work and life in here,” she said.</p>","<p>Living in scary times has inspired ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" author Jeff Kinney to write his new book ""Rowley Jefferson's Awesome Friendly Spooky Stories"".

""I was especially scared someone was hiding behind my shower curtain.""</p><p>The best piece of writing advice he has ever been given is ""you can't be a good writer without being a good reader first"".</p><p>David Michaelis' ""Schulz and Peanuts"" is a book Kinney has reread many times as it serves as a ""roadmap for my career, and helps me understand the possibilities"", he says.</p><p>The one popular children's book he has never got round to reading is ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" by Norman Juster.</p><p>His ideal writing scenario is in his car, at the cemetery.

He spent around $45,000 (5 million yen) on equipment and renovations of his school in 2019, preparing for the flood of foreigners.</p><p>Although his hopes of hosting overseas visitors have faded, however, Minamoto has found a new way to reach his students globally - online classes.</p><p>Holding a samurai sword ""katana"" in his right hand and an iPad in the left, Minamoto is now showing students the arts of the samurai on Zoom calls.</p><p>Minamoto charges $85 (9,450 yen) per student for in-person classes and $18 (2,000 yen) for the online version. Most of his online students are from Europe and the United States.</p><p>But the experience is not quite the same.</p><p>""If I were teaching in-person classes, I can directly correct the body posture or teach them more poses and techniques, but I think it's hard to do so through an online class,"" Minamoto said.</p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle/"" target=""_blank""><strong>Facebook </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle"" target=""_blank""><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>","<p>A ten-day food and craft festival was organised by the Consulate General of Afghanistan in Hyderabad to promote culture, trade and mutual relationship between New Delhi and Kabul.</p><p>""We aim to strengthen cultural and trade ties between India and Afghanistan.

In that case, hundreds of pieces were turned over to museums that commemorate the US internment of more than 110,000 people of Japanese descent for more than three years on the dubious claim they might betray America in the war.</p><p>The artwork for sale on eBay were 20 pencil sketches from 1942-43 with the name Matsumura written at the bottom, along with the word Manzanar. The drawings depict mostly what appear to be Japanese landscapes, including one of Mount Fuji.</p><p>The groups suggested the artist could be Giichi Matsumura, the subject of a series of stories first reported by The Associated Press about a Manzanar incarceree who died in a storm while sketching and painting in the high Sierra in the final days of the war. Several Matsumura families were held at the camp 180 miles (290 kilometers) north of Los Angeles.</p><p>Lori Matsumura, the granddaughter of Giichi who recently reburied her grandfather's remains after a hiker unearthed his skeleton in 2019, thought the sketches could be by her late father, Masaru, or another family member. The name printed in block letters was similar to the way her father signed high school reports.</p><p>She had discovered the auction Monday, day six of the weeklong bidding, and entered an $82 bid to try to buy the works. The price had climbed to over $470 when the sale was yanked by eBay.</p><p>The online auction site removed the sale because it violated an artifacts policy prohibiting the sale of items from government or protected land, spokeswoman Parmita Choudhury said in an email.</p><p>Matsumura had a mixed reaction to sale being halted.</p><p>“I feel I may never see those sketches again,” she said. “It depends how the seller reacts.”</p><p>Higuchi said eBay would contact the seller and put one of the groups in touch to try to obtain the collection.</p><p>The seller, listed as sunsetderby in Sharon Springs, New York, said the works came from a former girlfriend in the 1980s. The seller would not name the girlfriend in a follow-up message and said the full name of the artist was unknown.</p><p>The seller said they weren't violating eBay's policies and said other major auction houses had sold similar art.</p><p>“It’s absolutely preposterous to think that I am doing anything wrong,” the person wrote in response to a question sent through eBay.</p><p>But Nancy Ukai, project director at 50Objects.org, said sale would cause harm by putting a dollar sign on items that come from the trauma and suffering of what she said was essentially a hate crime against Japanese Americans.</p><p>People of Japanese descent were forced to burn letters and books before being bused to camps and often abandoned artwork and other items when they returned home.</p><p>“To put on a platform to the highest bidder is like a ransom to reclaim your history,” she said.</p><p>In a letter to eBay, the groups cited the current wave of attacks on Asian Americans in the US that have escalated recently.</p><p>“Sales of our history are never a good thing but are especially hurtful now, when we hear cries to ‘go back to your country,’ exactly what we were told during World War II,” they wrote.</p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle"" target=""_blank""><strong>Facebook </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle"" target=""_blank""><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>","<p>The bronze Sinnataggen sculpture is considered a national treasure and is arguably the most famous work by Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, who died in 1943 and has also designed the Nobel Peace Prize medal.</p><p>It depicts a small angry boy and was most likely modeled in 1928, the Vigeland Museum said in a statement, adding that “someone tried to saw over the left ankle of the sculpture” early Tuesday.</p><p>The statue was removed for conservation, and will be placed back in its original place “as soon as possible”</p><p>“This is damage to a protected cultural monument and the matter will be reported to the police,” said museum director Jarle Stroemodden. “We want the audience to have close access to the art of Vigeland and it is a pity that this (has happened).”</p><p>The Sinnataggen is part of the so called Vigeland Installation — a highly popular tourist attraction in Norway — that consists of dozens of sculptures and larger structures such as bridges and fountains at the Frogner Park close to the center of Oslo.</p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle"" target=""_blank""><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle?lang=en"" target=""_blank""><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>"

A magisterial inquiry has been ordered into the incident.</p><p>Reacting to Congress’ request to the EC, ruling BJP office bearers in Assam said that while they will be monitoring the strong rooms, the party has full faith in the poll body and its management of the EVMs.</p><p>“We are monitoring the strong rooms as per routine. But unlike the Congress, we have full faith in the EC and its conduct of the polls. Congress’s worry stems from the fact that they are losing.

As usual the CPI(M) denied any role in the murder.</p><p>In Kayamkulam in Alapzuha district two Congress workers were stabbed on Tuesday night and the party had blamed the CPI(M) workers.

Three home guards were demobilised. Even though the machines were kept as reserve, they were immediately replaced with new ones. The seals were intact. All the candidates were informed that the EVMs won’t be used in the poll process,” said a senior official of ECI.</p><p>Assembly elections were held in 31 constituencies in the third phase on Tuesday across three districts -- Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas.</p><p>The sector officer Tapan Sarkar claimed that they did not know that it was the house of a political leader, Goutam Ghosh affiliated to TMC and had only gone there to refresh themselves.</p><p>“My assistant sector officers and I were tired as we had been travelling from booth to booth on Monday. Around 1 am on Tuesday, when we reached the sector office, we found all rooms occupied. We were asked to spend the night in the car. One of my assistant sector officers said that he knew a person in that area and we can go to his house to rest before joining the poll duty from 4 am. We never knew he was a TMC leader...It was my fault and I accept it. I have been associated with polling duty for many years but really don’t know how I committed this mistake,” Sarkar told reporters.</p><p>The Bharatiya Janata Party, however, alleged that as the sector officers were state government officials they took the EVMs and VVPATs to rig the machines.</p><p>“The EVMs and VVPAT machines were found in the house of Goutam Ghosh, who happens to be the TMC booth president. A few villagers saw two vehicles outside the leader’s house and enquired. When they came to know that the sector officer has come, they informed me,” said Chiran Bera, the BJP’s candidate at Uluberia Uttar.</p><p>Incumbent MLA and TMC candidate Nirmal Maji refused to comment on the issue on the issue.</p><p>The BJP demanded an independent inquiry into the incident. Addressing a press conference in Delhi, senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said it was a serious matter. “And this becomes more serious that the machines were brought by a car which was on election duty. There should be full-fledged inquiry in this matter and we are sure that the Election Commission will do a separate and independent inquiry,” he said.</p><p>The incident is similar to one on April 2, when EC suspended four poll officials for using a BJP leader’s vehicle to take EVMs and VVPATs to the strong room in a constituency in Assam, with the one difference being that in that case, the event happened after voting.</p>","<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday hit out at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for her appeal to Muslim voters in the state to unite against the Bharatiya Janata Party, even as the Trinamool Congress supremo alleged that the BJP was threatening people to vote in its favor.</p><p>The state’s 31 constituencies constituency voted in the third phase on Tuesday.</p><p>Addressing a rally in North Bengal, the PM said, “If I had urged Hindus to unite and vote for BJP, the ECI would have sent me 8 – 10 notices. The poll panel sends notices to the Prime Ministers too. It would have made front-page news and all sorts of editorial pieces would have been written to tear me apart. I don’t know whether the ECI has sent any notice to Didi.”</p><p>The PM was referring to Banerjee’s remarks ahead of the third phase where she urged the Muslim voters to not vote for the BJP.</p><p>“A friend of BJP has come from Hyderabad. Along with a boy from Furfura Sharif he is spending crores of rupees and giving communal slogans. They are not only trying to divide Hindus and Muslims, but even attempting to split the Muslim votes. Don’t cast your vote for them because that would go to the BJP,” Banerjee had said on Saturday while addressing a rally in South 24 Parganas.</p><p>Of the total 294 constituencies in the state, 125 have a significant Muslim population.</p><p>“This proves that the people you had relied upon to win the elections have abandoned you and you are now publicly urging Muslims to unite and vote for you and save you,” Modi said.</p><p>According to the last Census, Muslims account for 27% of the state’s population. The community has traditionally voted for the Left and switched to the TMC in the last few elections. In the 2016 assembly polls, TMC, which won 211 of the 294 seats, won 90 seats in Muslim-dominated constituencies.</p><p>The PM also hit out at TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee, who is the CM’s nephew. “Didi has introduced a new tax – Bhaipo Service Tax. The poor daughters and sisters of Bengal saved their hard earned money, which went towards Bhaipo Service Tax. The youth of Bengal is yearning for every single penny and there <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>35 – <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>40 crore are coming in a month. That’s why there is a slogan coming up from every corner of Bengal – Chalo Paltai (lets change),” he said.</p><p>On Sunday, the BJP released a purported audio clip of a conversation between Kolkata-based businessman Ganesh Bagaria and absconding TMC leader Vinay Mishra, both of whom are suspects in the coal smuggling case. In the audio clip, one man could be heard saying that the money from the coal scam went to Abhishek Banerjee. HT could not independently verify the videos. The TMC has refuted the allegations.</p><p>The chief minister, meanwhile, alleged that BJP activists were occupying polling booths and attacking TMC candidates. “Only those party workers would be made polling agents who would not be afraid of the BJP. Even today (in the third phase polls) some agents fled after being threatened by BJP. TMC would reward those party workers who are not afraid of BJP,” she said at a public meeting here in Alipurduar district.</p><p>The TMC supremo said her party’s nominee in Arambagh, Sujata Mondal, was chased and hit on head near a polling booth by BJP workers. “They have inflicted serious injury on our Scheduled Caste candidate Sujata, when she visited a booth. They also hit another candidate in Khanakul. In Canning East, security forces prevented our nominee Shaukat Mollah from entering a booth. There had been numerous such instances of attack on our candidates, party workers across the state,” Banerjee said.</p><p>The CM further stated that she has received at least 100 complaints of assault and violence since the voted began on Tuesday, and the EC has been duly informed but to no avail.</p><p>Earlier in the day, the TMC chief tweeted that the BJP was misusing central forces to threaten people to vote in BJP’s favour.</p><p>“The blatant misuse of Central forces continues unabated. Despite us repeatedly raising this issue, @ECISVEEP continues to be a mute spectator while men in uniform are being misused at several places to openly intimidate TMC voters &amp; influence many to vote in favour of one party,” the CM said in a tweet.</p><p>Reiterating her allegations at a rally in Cooch Behar, she said, “We have lodged several FIR against the CRPF. We will lodge FIR against the commandants and take legal action. Everyone has the right to move the ECI.”</p><p>Alleging that the BJP leadership after experiencing a “poor turnout” in rallies has conspired against the TMC, Banerjee said, “Security forces have been asked not to resist booth capturing. Four of our activists have been murdered since the elections began, but no action has been taken. But you (BJP) cannot terrorise us, intimidate us by such acts.”</p>","<p>Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Tuesday said high voter turnout in Assam during polling reflects pro-incumbency as he exuded confidence that the BJP will return to power in the state for the second consecutive term.</p><p>With the conclusion of the third and final phase of polling on Tuesday for the Assam Assembly election, the BJP's victory is sealed for definite, he said.</p><p>""When the results are declared on May 2, Assam is going to send out a message loud and clear, which is going to echo across the country,"" said Singh, the Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office.</p><p>He said that in each of the three phases of polling, the voter turnout was consistently around 80 per cent and this is a ""pro-incumbency"" vote.</p><p>""The BJP will retain Assam for the second consecutive time. Votes cast in the polls are pro-incumbency and will help the BJP only,"" the minister said.</p><p>Singh recalled that in 2016 too the voting percentage was in the same range but it was against the Congress.</p><p>""The people of Assam not only saw the commitment and sincerity of the BJP's work but also saw how under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a revolutionary transformation has happened in Assam which had not happened in the last several decades of Congress rule,"" he said.</p><p>Singh claimed that it going to be noted with glory is that in the last seven years, the state not only underwent a revolutionary transformation as far as development is concerned, but even the psychological barriers were done away with and people of the entire region have completely intermingled and integrated with the rest of India.</p><p>""Today, even in the far-off southern and western states of India, the choicest aviation/aircrew or the hotel management industry is manned by youngsters from the northeastern region,"" he added.</p>","<p>For Tamil film enthusiasts it was a dream come true-seeing their favourite actors Ajith Kumar and Vijay up close when they turned up for voting on Tuesday for the Assembly election.

However, the actor picking a bicycle to go to the booth to vote led to speculation in social media. </p><p>Several netizens said it was a 'subtle' sign of opposition to rise in fuel prices while his publicist said it was only due to parking problems in the vicinity and nothing else.

With the BJP not expected to win a significant number of ACs in Kerala, any reduction in the BJP-led national Democratic Alliance’s current tally in Tamil Nadu or Assam could lead to a corresponding reduction in its strength in the Rajya Sabha. To be sure, these losses could be more than compensated if the BJP even manages to replicate its 2019 Lok Sabha performance in West Bengal.</p><p>With Covid-19 appropriate norms being flouted during campaigning, this election cycle could be one of the reasons these states are also seeing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. When elections to the four states and the UT of Puducherry were announced on February 26, all states except Kerala were going through a trough in terms of the seven-day average of daily new cases . On February 26, this seven-day average in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry was 22, 190, 456, and 22, respectively. By April 4, these numbers were far higher: 57, 1278, 2905, and 180 respectively in the four. In Kerala, the number was 3774 on February 26 and declining, reached a low of 1804 on March 18, but has since increased to 2463 by April 4. To be sure, even these increased numbers may not be capturing the full extent of the resurgence in cases, as testing in at least Assam and Kerala has reduced. On February 26, the 7-day-average of tests conducted was 13,013 and 61,840 in Assam and Kerala, respectively, which reduced to 11,505 and 48,777 on April 4. In Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, testing has increased, but not at the same rate as cases.</p>","<p>V K Sasikala’s name has been removed from the voter’s list from the Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai and she won’t be able to vote in the assembly election in the state on April 6, the expelled All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) leader’s aides said on Monday, with one of her supporters going so far as to term it “her civil death”.</p><p>According to them, names of Sasikala, her sister-in-law J Ilavarasi, and other family members and workers living at late J Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence, Veda Nilayam, were deleted after the AIADMK government acquired the premises to convert it into a memorial.</p><p>The current AIADMK government in the state is headed by Edapaddi K Palaniswami, a one-time protege of Sasikala, who made him chief minister just before being sent to jail for four years in a disproportionate assets case. Palaniswami promptly expelled her from the party.</p><p>A total of 19 people who were living in the house including the cook Rajammal who lived there for three decades are missing from the electoral rolls, the aides said. A separate case on the acquisition of the house and its conversion into a museum is pending with the Madras high court as Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew have claimed the property as her legal heirs.</p><p>Sasikala and Ilavarasi have been in a bengaluru jail since February 2017, and returned to Chennai in February after serving a four-year prison term. The two currently live in T Nagar which also falls under the Thousand Lights constituency.</p><p>Sasikala’s counsel Raja Senthoor Panidan approached the election commission for her name to be included from the new address on March 17. “On March 16, I came to know that her name was deleted and the next day at 11.30am, I met chief election officer Satyabrata Sahoo but he said his powers to make changes in electoral rolls was over on March 9,” said Pandian.</p><p>“Just because the government took over the property, how can they delete the names without issuing any notice to us? As her advocate, I will seek action against the officer who deleted her name without a valid reason because of which she has lost her franchise.”</p><p>According to the Representation of People’s Act, people residing in a particular area can register themselves in electoral rolls by applying to booth-level electoral officers with relevant proof of residence documents. While enrollment is a continuous process throughout the year, for election bound states, the Election Commission has a cut-off date after which no names can be added</p><p>“This cut-off date is to enable a level playing field and prevent last minute additions in the electoral rolls. Also, most of the personnel engaged in updating electoral rolls are also on election related duty and therefore, the cut-off date is given. In exceptional cases, where the name of the person has been wrong removed, it can be added even after the cut-off date,” a senior election commission official said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>He added that since Sasikala was not residing at the Chennai address for several years, election officers may have deleted her name. The name could had been added had she applied on time, he added.</p><p>“In 2019 itself her name was deleted before the Lok Sabha elections, it is being made into an issue now,” said Thousand Lights’s assistant electoral rolls officer, Ravi Kumar. “We had sent a notice to the concerned party asking if they are residing there and gave ample time but since we didn’t get any response we have deleted the names as per procedure. I’ve an election to conduct tomorrow. I’ve given my detailed response to the election commission. They will give a reply to the media.”</p><p>Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran’s party Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) said it was conspiracy by the government. “They have caused a civil death of V K Sasikala,” AMMK’s Thousand Lights candidate N Vaidhyanathan. “The government has the power to delete the names of people only if they have died or if they apply for a change of address. The state and central government have deliberately done this. We also found 19,000 voters’ names who are AMMK supporters are missing.”</p><p>Poes Garden falls under the Thousand Lights constituency. Interestingly, actor Rajinikanth and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s leader MK Stalin are also voters in the constituency.</p><p>The AMMK candidate has written to the ECI , seeking postponement of the election in the Thousand Lights constituency until Sasikala’s name is included. In his letter, Sasikala is still mentioned as the AIADMK’s general secretary.</p><p>While Sasikala was still in jail, Dhinakaran floated AMMK with a breakaway faction of her supporters. After her release she made moves to reclaim the AIADMK but the party under chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami refused to accommodate her. Sasika’s conviction means she cannot hold an elected post or public office till 2027.</p>","<p>The stage is set for the third and final phase of assembly elections in Assam.

He crisscrossed the state and interacted with a cross-section of people to prepare the party’s manifesto for the April 6 assembly elections. Shashi Tharoor, also an MP from Thiruvananthapuram, spoke to Hindustan Times about UDF’s prospects, BJP’s threat and many other issues ahead of the Kerala assembly polls. Here are the excerpts from the interview.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>It is a close fight in Kerala. You travelled across the state and talked to a crosssection of people. Will you agree the state will stick to its usual script of booting out the incumbent?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>I think we are poised for a comfortable victory. The arrogance, violent politics and corruption of the LDF government, coupled with gross financial mismanagement, have created anti-incumbency. In addition, our “people’s manifesto”, arrived at after extensive consultations, and our list of candidates, featuring 55% fresh faces, have inspired confidence. Against the proven corruption over which the LDF has presided, we offer far-reaching welfare provisions, major educational reform, and an investor-friendly approach that will generate much-needed revenues for the state, whereas the LDF has been shamelessly piling on debt for future generations to pay.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Almost all poll surveys have predicted an edge to the ruling dispensation. Can you simply brush them aside as mere publicity blitzkrieg?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The pre-poll surveys, the most recent of which asked voters’ opinions more than two weeks ago and in less than a third of the constituencies, reflect the crores of rupees in pre-election publicity the LDF spent, blanketing the media with their propaganda. That is wearing off as the campaign progresses and the last ten days have seen a decisive shift in momentum towards the UDF. I tweeted a warning a week ago to the ruling party, “do not count the ships in the harbour but see which way the wind is blowing” It’s even truer now that the wind is blowing the UDF’s way.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/kerala-assembly-election/kerala-elections-around-60k-police-personnel-140-companies-of-central-forces-drones-deployed-for-security-101617622109794.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Kerala polls - Police personnel, central forces, drones deployed for security</strong></a></p><p><strong>Q: </strong>In the high-pitch campaign, the Congress-led UDF came up considerably in the last lap. How did Gandhi siblings help in this?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> I have no doubt that the active, recurrent and tireless presence of the Gandhi siblings made a real difference. They have been everywhere. Other factors also helped. For instance, 55% of our candidates are fresh faces and it takes some time for first-timers to be recognized and establish their appeal. That is clearly happening and the momentum has turned our way. I expect a comfortable victory when the results are announced on May 2.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>You talked to many youngsters while preparing the manifesto. Are they really disgusted with present-day politics? What are their aspirations?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The interactions were indispensable because they gave us an opportunity to hear from all sections of society about their problems, anxieties, needs and aspirations. We spoke to experts and ordinary people; entrepreneurs and employees; teachers and students; hotel owners and auto-rickshaw drivers; vulnerable women, landless Dalits, IT professionals and business investors. The manifesto reflects our best understanding of what the people of Kerala wish to see going forward. Against the proven corruption over which the LDF has presided, we offer far-reaching welfare provisions, major educational reforms, and an investor-friendly approach that will generate much-needed revenues for the state. Employment is in crisis with 40.5% of Kerala’s youngsters unemployed and even those who studied hard and made it to the PSC rank-lists now find themselves bypassed for government jobs via the back door by Communists and their family members. Young people want jobs, a fair share and new opportunities. Our manifesto provides them all this – for instance, an internship programme with incentives to companies and credit for students to conduct such internships while the student is still in college. This was suggested by a student at St Teresa’s in Kochi on my visit.</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>In many areas, apolitical outfits (like the Twenty20) pose a real challenge to mainline political parties. Do you think they pose any danger to the democratic system?</p><p><strong>A:</strong> They do pose a danger to “politics as usual”. I, for one, am not prepared to attack a party that promises to provide clean and efficient administration. Every citizen deserves just that. But “apolitical” groups have no answers to the great political issues of our time. They are implementers, not policy-makers. That will never be enough in any democracy.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> It is a fact that after every election BJP-NDA votes are going up. Will Kerala remain an impregnable fort to saffron forces?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>The BJP can only offer communalism, tired scare-mongering over “love Jihad” and a hate-filled politics of bigotry and division that will never go far in pluralist, inclusive Kerala. They have gone from a 5% party to a 15% party and have hit their ceiling in the state. Mr Sreedharan’s impact peaked with the announcement of his candidacy. An 88-year-old technocrat cannot be the answer to the state’s political future.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-to-bjp-key-factors-at-play-in-kerala-101617563111487.html"" target=""_blank""><strong>Sabarimala to BJP - Key factors at play in Kerala</strong></a></p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Any plan to get active in state politics?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>I am hardly inactive! I led the manifesto consultations before the elections. As a “star campaigner”, I have campaigned in 56 different constituencies for UDF candidates. But that is the extent of my involvement in state politics so far. I do have a job to do in New Delhi, entrusted to me by the party and by the voters of Thiruvananthapuram. That is where I expect to continue, unless and until the party wills otherwise.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Opposition parties say Rahul Gandhi’s pet project NYAY is impossible to implement. What do you say about it?</p><p><strong>A: </strong>NYAY has been devised after thorough homework and costing. We will ensure it is implemented as a model programme for the rest of the nation to emulate. 6,000 rupees a month to the poorest households is not an impossible dream. It will be implemented.</p>","<p>Tuesday (April 6) is going to be a big day electorally, as all four states and the union territory of Puducherry will witnessing polling that day. While Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Kerala have single-phased election, Assam will witness polling in third and final phase of Assembly polls.</p><p>In West Bengal, this will be third of the eight phases; the rest are scheduled on April 10, 17, 22, 26 and 29. The counting of votes in all the states and Puducherry will be held on May 2.</p><p>The Election Commission of India (ECI) has made elaborate arrangements for the polling tomorrow, with a special focus on Covid-19 and security. While announcing the schedule for the election on February 26, the commission said that it has increased the number of polling booths and phases to ensure Covid-19 protocols can be followed.</p><p>Here's how various states have prepared for tomorrow's elections:</p><p><strong>West Bengal</strong></p><p>The voting in this phase will be held in 31 assembly constituencies in three districts - Hooghly (8), Howrah (7) and South 24 Parganas (16).</p><p>A total of 832 companies of central security forces have been deployed in the constituencies to ensure a peaceful election. Out of these, 214 companies of Quick Response Teams (QRTs) will be present in the third phase.</p><p>There are 205 candidates in the fray in this round of polling, with Diamond Harbour having the maximum number of candidates - 11. It is the parliamentary constituency of Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Abhishek Banerjee, the nephew of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.</p><p>As many as 78,52,425 electors will take part in the third phase of the polls. While the Kulpi constituency has the lowest electorate count with 2,20,600, Jagatballavpur has the highest number of electorates at 2,88,099.</p><p>The BJP's Swapan Dasgupta, who is contesting from the Tarakeswar constituency in Hooghly, is among the high-profile candidates in this phase. In the Arambagh constituency, TMC has fielded Sujata Mondal Khan against CPI(M)'s Sakti Mohan Malik and BJP's Madhusudhan Bag. Sujata Mondal Khan is the wife of BJP MP Saumitra Khan.</p><p>In the 2016 elections, the TMC bagged 29 seats and the Left Front won two seats out of the 31 which will be going to polls in the third phase on Tuesday. In terms of vote share, the TMC secured 50 per cent, the Left Front had 37 per cent and the BJP got 7 per cent.</p><p>Polling for the first two phases of the West Bengal elections were held on March 27 and April 1, respectively.</p><p><strong>Assam</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Assam is all set for the third and last phase of polling on Tuesday. This phase will decide the fate of 337 candidates across 40 constituencies of 12 districts, including senior minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Hemanta Biswa Sarma, who is contesting the polls from Jalukbari constituency.</p><p>Apart from Hemanta Biswa Sarma, BJP minister Chandra Mohan Patowary from Dharampur, education minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya from Gauhati East, and BJP state chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass from Patacharkuchi are also in the fray.</p><p>In this phase, 79,19,641 voters will exercie their franchise. Of these, 40,11,539 are males, 39,07,963 females and 139 are other genders.</p><p>As many as 320 Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) companies have been deployed to ensure a free and fair election in the state. The State Armed Police (SAP) is also part of the security arrangements.</p><p>The BJP formed its first government in Assam after securing a thumping win in the 2016 elections. This time too, BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has conducted hectic campaigning in the poll-bound constituencies. From NDA's camp, top leaders like Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, Smriti Irani, Jitendra Singh, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, and Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan have campaigned in the state.</p><p>The BJP's alliance includes the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People's Party Liberal (UPPL).</p><p>The BJP has been challenged by the 'Mahajot', an alliance which includes Congress, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Liberation, the Anchalik Gana Marcha (AGM) and the Bodoland People's Front (BPF).</p><p>In the 2016 assembly elections, Congress and AIUDF fought separately. While Congress got 30.9 per cent of the vote share, AIUDF got 13 per cent of vote share last time. The BJP, meanwhile, secured 29.5 per cent of votes and its allies AGP and BPF got 8.1 and 3.9 per cent respectively.</p><p>Gauhati West constituency with 15 candidates has the highest number of candidates in the fray. The Boko (SC) seat with three candidates has the least number of candidates. The first phase took place on March 27 with a voter turnout of nearly 77 per cent, while a voter turnout of nearly 74.76 per cent was recorded in the second phase of polling on April 1.</p><p><strong>Kerala</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Kerala heads for Assembly elections on Tuesday with battlelines drawn between the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) which hopes for continuity of term, and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) even as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is being seen as a potential threat in many places.</p><p>The single-phase election will be held on Tuesday under the security of 59,292 police personnel and 140 companies of central forces. Kerala Police chief Loknath Behra said that the entire state will be divided into special security zones and police force will be deployed under the supervision of senior officers.</p><p>Drones will also be used to detect crowds and prevent obstruction of voters. Campaigning came to an end in the state on Sunday for the 957 candidates in the fray for the elections.</p><p>Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the Kerala Assembly since 2016, Ramesh Chennithala, is one of the key candidates in the election. He is contesting from the Haripad constituency for the fifth time against BJP's K Soman and CPI's R Sajilal.</p><p>In the 2016 Assembly elections Congress' Chennithala won from this seat defeating CPI's P Prasad by a margin of 18,621 votes. Under his leadership, the UDF won 19 of the 20 Lokm Sabha seats in 2019.</p><p>Kerala has a history of alternatively giving power to LDF and UDF. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan (of LDF) aims to break the trend and take oath for his second term as the head of the state. In recent months, the gold smuggling case has generated a lot of heat in the state, and given the opposition a lot of ammo against Vijayan. M Sivasankar, his former principal secretary, was arrested in connection with the case. It is being probed by various central agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate.</p><p>Vijayan is contesting polls from the Dharmadam constituency in Kannur district against UDF candidate C Raghunath and veteran BJP leader CK Padmanabhan.</p><p><strong>Tamil Nadu</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In Tamil Nadu, elections for 234 assembly constituencies in 38 districts will be held in a single phase on April 6.

In the 2016 election, AIADMK then led by Jayalalithaa, emerged victorious. After her death, Edappadi K Palaniswami became the chief minister.</p><p>These elections will decide whether Palaniswami will continue as CM or DMK leader MK Stalin will emerge as the winner in the contest for the coveted post. MK Stalin-led DMK, which is out of power since 2011 in Tamil Nadu, is in a head-to-head battle with AIADMK in nearly 130 constituencies.</p><p>Palaniswami is contesting from Edappadi seat in Salem district. The DMK fielded a debutant 37-year-old T Sampath Kumar against him. Stalin, meanwhile, is trying his luck again from Kolathur seat. He will face AIADMK's Adhi Rajaram.</p><p>Actor Kamal Haasan too has joined the fray this time. He is going to make his electoral debut from the South Coimbatore constituency - the assembly segment where his Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) got more than 1 lakh votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p><p>Haasan formed the MNM in February 2018. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the MNM had a vote share of 3.72 per cent.</p><p><strong>Puducherry</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A total of 30 constituencies across the UT are going to polls on Tuesday, in which 324 candidates are in the fray.

Her leg is broken, but she is still fighting."" The veteran Bollywood actor lauded the Bengali spirit in an apparent dig against ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and said that no one has ever succeeded by ""intimidating"" Bengalis.</p><p>""Bengalis never bow their heads before threat or intimidation,"" she added.</p><p>Bachchan said shame on them who are criticising Banerjee.</p><p>""She is fighting for the rights and respect of the people of Bengal.

The next phase of polling will take place on April 6. The elections in West Bengal are being conducted in eight phases.</p>","<p>In Tamil Nadu’s assembly election, there is neither a strong wave in favour of the incumbent, nor intense anti-incumbency generating a visible wave for the challenger. It is an election which is, in characteristic Tamil Nadu fashion, a bipolar contest between the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) despite the presence of several other players in the fray. </p><p>It is an election which is also an all-out political war between a chief ministerial candidate by design, DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi’s son, MK Stalin, who has been waiting for his turn for decades, and a chief minister by accident, Edappadi Palaniswami who has kept the AIADMK together after J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016 and has surprised many by coming into his own. </p><p><b>The challenge for AIADMK</b></p><p>Interviews with a cross-section of voters, across the state, in the past month, indicate that this will be a closely fought battle, but observers give an edge to the DMK, largely because the AIADMK has been in power for 10 years, there is a desire for change, and citizens want to give to give Stalin a chance. But what complicates the electoral landscape is that this desire for change isn’t necessarily accompanied with deep anger against the ruling party. CM Palaniswami isn’t disliked. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/tamil-nadu-an-election-that-is-stalin-s-to-lose-101617562365172.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Tamil Nadu: An election that is Stalin’s to lose</a></b></p><p>The challenge for the AIADMK, however, is that after Jayalalithaa’s death, the party’s vote base faces the threat of splitting in five directions — towards Naam Tamizhar Katchi’s S Seeman in rural areas, Makkal Needhi Maiam’s Kamal Haasan in urban centres, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam’s TTV Dhinakaran in southern and central regions, and the principal opposition DMK in pockets of the state. </p><p>Another factor is the alliance arithmetic. The DMK has stitched together a rainbow alliance with a combination of Left, Dalit and Muslim parties to keep intact a “secular alliance” while the AIADMK has lost some of its allies, including Vijayakanth’s Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) when seat-sharing talks failed. Vijayakanth’s party is contesting i60 seats after joining hands with AIADMK’s rebel-faction led by Dhinakaran. </p><p>AIADMK’s main allies — Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — continue to attract and polarise the voters with their ideologies based on caste and Hindutva respectively. The ruling party has reached out to the minorities — Christians and Muslims constitute 12% of the state population — and asked them not to judge AIADMK based on its alliance with the BJP, but how this translates into voting is to be seen. </p><p>As the incumbent force, AIADMK also has to quell the anger from movements such as the justice for sexual assault victims in Pollachi, farmers protesting against the Salem-Chennai expressway and several other Centrally approved projects. </p><p><b>The nature of campaigning</b></p><p>The uncertainty about this election also stems from the fact that for the first time in decades, towering personalities who dominated the political landscape of the state have all gone. This is the first election without Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, and both parties have used images of their late leaders in campaign machinery, named schemes after them in election manifestos, and vowed to bring their rule. </p><p>Stalin has said all the 234 candidates in the DMK’s coalition are Karunanidhi’s candidates. He began his campaign targeting the dual leadership of AIADMK’s Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam for corruption, and has alleged that the AIADMK is a slave of the BJP. </p><p>In the last leg of his campaign, Stalin claimed that the election was a direct fight between the DMK and BJP to reclaim the rights and autonomy of Tamil Nadu. “Every vote for the AIADMK is a vote for the BJP,” he has repeatedly said in the final days, ahead of polling. In the 2019 parliamentary elections, the Stalin-led Opposition won 38 of the 39 Lok Sabha seats, riding on an anti-Narendra Modi wave and confronting an AIADMK that was in disarray without Jayalalithaa. As the polls draw closer, Stalin is urging voters to repeat their 2019 decision. </p><p>The message has resonated with loyal voters. “It’s going to be a tough fight but the DMK will race ahead,” said a hotelier, S Prabhakar, in Cuddalore from the southern region which is the stronghold of the DMK. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/40yrold-reservation-demand-conceded-in-tn-is-it-working-for-pmk-101617616756127.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">40-yr-old reservation demand conceded in TN: Is it working for PMK?</a></b></p><p>The AIADMK is, however, countering charges by drawing its strength from Palaniswami’s image as the common man’s CM and the party’s relatively efficient management of the Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu. </p><p>Palanswami has highlighted his government’s work and welfare schemes. “In AIADMK, even a cadre and a farmer like me can become the chief minister but under DMK only their family will grow,” Palaniswami says at least once in his campaign everyday. He has targeted the DMK on cases of land-grabbing, strong-man culture and arrogance, evoking memories of the time the party was in power a decade ago.</p><p>The party’s loyal voters, especially in stronghold regions, say they will stick to it. </p><p>“No matter who contests for the AIADMK, I’ll vote for the party and Palaniswami has done well and created any problems for the people,” said a small vendor, G Desikan in Coimbatore. He belongs to the western region, which has been an AIADMK citadel that helped Jayalalithaa retain the government in 2016. </p><p>BJP leaders, including Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, have campaigned on the ground that Tamil Nadu requires a good state-Centre relationship for its benefit. The ruling combine has also targeted DMK over dynastic politics with Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi making his debut from Karunanidhi’s constituency. “You want Udhayanidhi ’s growth or your growth?” Shah asked a crowd last week to which Udhayanidhi retorted with the home minister’s son, Jay Shah’s position in the Board of Control for Cricket in India. </p><p>The two parties have also engaged in high-quality visual campaigns on social media and hired political strategists. The DMK is taking the advice of Prashant Kishore’s Indian Political Action Committee (I-PAC). Palaniswami personally roped in Sunil Kanugolu in 2020 who had previously worked for the DMK and Stalin’s image building in the 2016 assembly elections. </p><p>Political analysts say that no matter who wins, the margin would be narrow. “In many constituencies the winner will be decided by a difference of 10,000 votes,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “I don’t see any major sweep. In recent years, AIADMK was able to contain the anti-incumbency (in 2016), Modi came back with more numbers in 2019 and in 2020, Nitish Kumar was able to come back to power in Bihar. If opinion polls are to be believed, Kerala may go back to the LDF. And so it seems people don’t mind incumbency as long as you get a decent rule and nobody harasses you everyday.”</p><p><b>The smaller players </b></p><p>But while the contest is essential bipolar with voters who have fixed loyalties, there are also several other players who are relying on swing voters in this election. </p><p>Voters face a conundrum. On the one hand, there are too many choices — there are five parties in the fray vying to form the government — and on the other, voters are aware that these forces don’t have a real shot at winning power in Chennai. </p><p>Those who are disenchanted with both the leading parties want an alternative, although this is a small group. “Kamal Haasan does very different movies and he would be a different chief minister too,” says C Chitra. “I know it will take another five years for him to win over the electorate. And we will support him until then,” she says, having convinced some members of her family in Salem to vote for Haasan. But in a sign of the challenge for newer forces, Chitra’s husband’s is still with the AIADMK and will vote for his older party. </p><p>Another actor with a degree of support is Vijayakanth, but he isn’t contesting and hasn’t spoken a word while campaigning due to his ailing health. Admirers from his days in cinema in the 1980s and 90s say they know he won’t make it but continue to have a soft corner for him. The actor’s wife, Premalatha, is making her electoral debut and evokes him in almost every sentence. </p><p>Tamil nationalist Seeman, has captured the audience with his fist thumping oratory and switching from classical Tamil to colloquial expletives. “Everyone says Seeman will never get a chance but unless we vote for him how will he?” says a cement shop owner S Viswesananthan in Villupuram. “No one has had any benefits from both parties, and they make fake promises, at least Seeman is practical. I like his speeches.” </p><p>Dinakaran, abandoned by his aunt VK Sasikala, is expected to play a spoiler for the AIADMK, eating into the Mukkalathor community vote bank of the party in at least 25-30 seats. Sasikala who has decided to step away from politics is quietly touring temples across Tamil Nadu. If the AIADMK loses, it would bring the focus back to Sasikala’s potential moves to reclaim the party. </p><p>But political observers believe that these smaller forces, without a formidable track record or organisational base, may affect the prospects of the bigger forces, depending on specific constituency alignments, but will have little impact on their own in the 2021 election. </p>","<p>The stage is set for third and final phase of polls in Assam voting for which will take place on Tuesday. </p><p>A total of 337 candidates (25 women) are contesting from 40 of the total 126 seats in the state in the third phase. Over 7.9 million voters would cast their vote in 11,401 polling stations (316 all women). </p><p>The key candidates for third phase include BJP leader and senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma (Jalukbari), BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass (Patacharkuchi), cabinet minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya (BJP-Guwahati East), cabinet minister Phani Bhushan Choudhury (Asom Gana Parishad—Bongaigaon) and minister Pramila Rani Brahma (Bodoland Peoples’ Front—Kokrajhar East). </p><p>In the third phase, the ruling BJP has 20 candidates while its alliance partners AGP and United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) will contest from 13 and 8 seats respectively. On the other hand, Opposition Congress is contesting 24 seats and its alliance partners All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) have 12 and 8 candidates respectively. </p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/assam-assembly-election""><b>Click here for full coverage of Assam assembly elections</b></a></p><p>Over 45,600 polling personnel will be on duty on Tuesday and 320 companies of security personnel have been deployed to maintain law and order. Each polling station would be manned by a constable and home guard. </p><p>‘In the first two phases of polling itself BJP has got enough seats close to forming a government. We will form a BJP-majority government in Assam,” Union home minister Amit Shah said at poll rally in Sorbhog on Sunday. </p><p>“Congress follows a policy of divide and rule whereas BJP under Narnedra Modi believes in ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ (with all, development of all and with trust of all). We have made Assam terrorism-free and agitation-free and in the next five years, we will make the state flood-free,” he added. </p><p>Congress state president Ripun Bora accused BJP of trying to polarise voters with a communal campaign. He thanked people of Assam for not getting swayed and expressing faith in the grand alliance. </p><p>“The message from the ground is clear. There will be a clean sweep by Congress and our alliance partners. We are ready to form the government in Assam and assure voters that our five guarantees will be implemented,” he said. </p><p>Like the previous two phases on March 27 and April 1, besides harping on development and welfare schemes of the government, BJP focused on attacking Congress and AIUDF and warned voters that Assam’s identity and ‘sanskriti’ would be lost if the Congress ‘mahajot’ (grand alliance) comes to power. </p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi even termed the grand-alliance as ‘maha-jhooth’ (grand lies) in one of his rallies. AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal continued to be the main target. Incidents like Ajmal hitting a person with a ‘gamosa’ (traditional towel) in a rally was highlighted as an attack on Assamese people. </p><p>On the other hand, Congress is banking on its five guarantees to voters --200 units of free electricity to all households, non-implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Assam, <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>2,000 per month to housewives, <span class=""webrupee"">₹</span>365 daily wage to tea-garden workers and 500,000 government jobs in five years—to see the party and the alliance through. </p><p>In 2016, BJP won 11 of the 40 seats, Congress also won 11, AIUDF got 6, AGP won 4 and BPF got 8. But unlike last time when BPF was part of the BJP camp, the party has switched sides and joined the Congress grand alliance. </p><p>“The interesting contest of the third phase would be witnessed in the eight seats in Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR). Last time, BPF had won all these seats,” said Solomon Islary, associate professor of political science at Kokrajhar-based Bodoland University. </p><p>“This time, they have a contest at hand with UPPL, which is part of the BJP alliance and came to power in the Bodoland Territorial Council in December along with the saffron party. How many seats both these parties win or lose could decide which alliance would form the next government,” he added. </p>","<p>At one time Jadavpur used to be called the 'Leningrad of Calcutta'.</p><p>Today it is the setting for an epic battle between CPI(M), which is trying to resuscitate its political fortunes in West Bengal, and Trinamool Congress that is trying desperately to get enough seats to ward off its main rival BJP, whose saffron surge has unnerved the ruling party, ten years since it uprooted the Left rule in the state.</p><p>The upcoming election to the Jadavpur assembly seat in the southern suburbs of Kolkata on April 10 is perhaps symbolic of the larger battle for Bengal.</p><p>The CPI(M) is fighting to protect its last bastion in the eastern metropolis after losing all other assembly constituencies falling under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to TMC.</p><p>Jadavpur is the only seat that it managed to regain in the city in 2016.</p><p>However, in the 2019 election to the Jadavpur Lok Sabha constituency, Left Front candidate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya had trailed by over 12,000 votes to TMC's Mimi Chakraborty in the namesake assembly seat.</p><p>For the TMC, the fight is to regain the assembly seat it had lost to the CPI(M) in 2016 after snatching it from the then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya in 2011 when the party had stormed to power, ending the 34-year Left rule.</p><p>Winning the seat will also be symbolic for the BJP as Jadavpur University, known as the stronghold of the Left and ultra-Left students unions and where Union minister and nominee in neighbouring Tollygunge seat Babul Supriyo was heckled in 2019, is the centrepiece of the constituency.</p><p>It is one of the few seats in and around Kolkata which will witness a three-cornered contest.</p><p>However, on the ground, problems faced by the locals may play a more important role than political or ideological symbolism.</p><p>Sitting MLA Sujan Chakraborty, who had in 2016 clinched the seat from TMC's Manish Gupta, who in turn had defeated Bhattacharya in 2011, is going to the polls with issues like unemployment, the law and order situation and fuel price rise.</p><p>""People of Jadavpur, like across West Bengal, are politically aware.

The same way people of Jadavpur had defeated Bhattacharya in 2011 but elected the CPI(M) again in 2016.</p><p>Jadavpur, which has over 2.69 lakh voters, is dominated by descendants of people who had migrated from erstwhile East Bengal and then East Pakistan in waves following Partition in 1947.</p><p>A feeling of deprivation among the refugee settlers saw Jadavpur turning decisively towards the Left when the first Jukta Front or United Front rode to power in 1967. The seat has since then remained a Left bastion, electing CPI(M) candidates, including Bhattacharya, who won five times since 1987.</p><p>The BJP on the other hand is trying to muscle in by reviving the refugee feeling, harping on its poll plank of implementation of CAA. It is to be seen how much the promise of giving citizenship cuts ice with the erstwhile refugees.</p><p>Riding on the 'poriborton' (change) wave of 2011, former state chief secretary Manish Gupta had defeated the then chief minister by over 16,000 votes. He, however, lost to Chakraborty by nearly 15,000 votes in the 2016 election, when a Left resurgence was visible in the constituency.</p><p>The TMC has this time fielded four-time KMC ward councillor and a chartered accountant by profession, 56-year- old Debabrata Majumdar, aka Moloy, as its candidate for the seat.</p><p>""As councillor for over 20 years, I have worked for the development and beautification of Jadavpur.

Her family owns no land, and work as wood artisans. But the rural economy is depressed and her family of five only makes money when someone in the village orders a window frame, table or bench. Anxious, they have now bought five buffaloes to sell their milk. “But sometimes we don’t get the just price. It becomes difficult to run the household,” she said. </p><p>The impoverished village of 1,200 people is ringfenced by green fields. Most people work in fields, either as farmers or agricultural labourers, live in cheek-by-jowl mud houses with a shed for cattle, and travel four or 5km to the nearest market of Udaynarayanpur to sell their produce. Young men have migrated to bigger cities, and the money they send back sustains their families. Most households have no one working a permanent job or graduating college. Attendance is dwindling at the only secondary school. </p><p>Ganesh Chandra Dolui is an exception. The 59-year-old is a state government officer who lives in a brick house, with furniture in every room. His sons have graduated college, but don’t have jobs. One runs a poultry farm while the other is getting ready for competitive examinations. Dolui also own farmland but the recurring floods have dented his income. Still, he isn’t happy. </p><p>“Look at us, we are not well-to-do. But as a general caste, we don’t have reservation either,” said Dolui. </p><p>Khara, Hazra and Dolui all belong to Mahishya community, arguably the largest caste group in Bengal with roots in farming and decisive influence across a broad swath of southern Bengal. By many estimates, they make up almost a quarter of the state’s population. </p><p>After decades of being a silent voting community, they have been pushed under the spotlight by an increasingly bitter competition between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for the community’s support. Both parties have promised to accord the community other backward class status, a game-changing pledge that is being described by many experts as Bengal’s mini Mandal moment. “This is a seismic shift,” said Anirban Bandyopadhyay, a professor at Karnavati University. </p><p>The Mahishyas are incredibly diverse, not centralised in their political mobilisation and scattered across five districts of southern Bengal — which makes electoral mobilisation difficult. Still, both parties are pulling out no stops to court the largely rural community and the resultant dynamics playing out in villages such as Pancharul can transform the politics of the state for decades to come. “All other communities talk about reservation. If they can get the benefits of quota, why shouldn’t we?” asked Dolui. </p><p><b>The evolution of the Mahishya identity </b></p><p>The Mahishyas occupy an influential space in Bengal today, especially in the provincial towns in Howrah, Hoogly and Purba Medinipur where people from the caste are prominent businessmen, industrialists and politicians. </p><p>They ruled the royal house in Medinipur, and several prominent estates. The 19th century zamindar Rani Rashmoni, who is responsible for constructing the famous Dakshineswar Kali Temple, was Mahishya. In urban areas, they form a section of the influential class; in rural areas, their condition is worse but significantly better than the lower castes. </p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com""><b>For complete coverage of West Bengal assembly election, click here</b></a></p><p>“In some ways, they are the gentry of the districts; after independence, they wielded tremendous influence in Bengal’s politics and were accommodated in power structures,” said Bandyopadhyay. </p><p>But it was not always so. </p><p>Until 1931, the Mahishyas were classified as depressed class, a category that transformed into scheduled caste in independent India. This was a time when the community was known as an “ajalacharaniya”, which was barred from serving water to higher castes, explained Bandyopadhyay. </p><p>But more affluent sections had already started to identify by a different name — chasi kaibarta — and in 1931, wrote to the British government and asked to be removed from the depressed class list. The community leaders — who formed the backbone of the Congress party in the state — thought they were advanced and wanted to dissociate from the stigma of being attached to lower caste status. </p><p>“Yes, we didn’t want to be called scheduled caste; but that shouldn’t preclude us from being considered for OBC status. This is a 30-year demand that subsequent governments have dragged their feet on,” said Timir Halder, a community leader based in Kolkata. </p><p>Unlike other major communities in Bengal, the Mahishyas were largely untouched by Partition. After independence, they controlled the Bengal Congress but their political clout rapidly waned since the 1980s as the Left Front expanded its footprint and party structure permeated every section of society. The agrarian downturn, the rapid closure of factories in Howrah and Hoogly and shrinking rural income left the influential community fractured and weakened. In the 1990s, when a wave of OBC consolidation was sweeping northern India, the community began articulating its demand for OBC status. But it had very limited success. </p><p><b>The battle over reservations </b></p><p>The history of OBC reservation in Bengal is unique. When the backward classes commission visited the state in 1979, then chief minister Jyoti Basu told them that Bengal had only two castes: rich and poor. Even when OBC reservation was implemented across India in the 1990s, Bengal only instituted a 7% quota for them, and didn’t include any influential community in it. So, the kind of consolidation seen in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar or Tamil Nadu was absent in Bengal because of a lack of political will, or mobilisation by an influential caste. </p><p>The churn first began in 2006, when the justice Rajinder Sachar committee report found that Muslims in Bengal were worse off than their counterparts in most other states, despite the Left Front’s rhetoric on minority welfare and its strong hold on Muslim votes. In 2010, facing a massive electoral defeat, the government added a most-backward quota to the OBC category and included some Muslim castes in it. This is also when a section of Mahishyas were included. </p><p>When Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011, she expanded the categories. Eager to grow roots in the absence of a disciplined cadre structure, Banerjee eagerly courted backward castes — both Hindu and Muslim — at a time more families grew dependent on government jobs and subsidies in the absence of major industries. </p><p>Today, Bengal’s OBC “A” category of “more backward classes” includes 81 communities, 61 of whom are Muslims. 38 out of the 96 communities in the OBC “B” category are Muslims. The A category has 10% quota while B has 7%. In her 2019 election speeches, Banerjee repeatedly claimed to have brought 99% of the state’s Muslims under the OBC umbrella. </p><p>The move has transformed the lives of many Muslim families, especially in the rural districts. Amir Ali’s family, for example, never dreamt that someone in their clan could graduate college. “I could only get in because of the reservation. I am now hoping my sister will also be able to go to college,” said Ali, whose parents work as labourers. </p><p>But it has generated significant resentment among sections of the Hindu OBCs, a sentiment that the BJP hopes to exploit. The Mahishyas are a crucial piece in this puzzle. </p><p>“As some Muslims become more mobile and educated, sections of Hindu OBCs feel that their entitlements are taken away. But the real problem is the relatively small quota for OBCs at 17%,” said Abdul Matin, a professor at Jadavpur University. </p><p>Dulal Das agreed. “We are angry about this religious reservation and are ready to even go to court. The Left front cheated us, and now, the quotas we deserve are unfairly going to others,” said the retired doctor, a resident of Barasat in North 24 Parganas. </p><p>HT attended several corner meetings and rallies organised by the BJP in Mahishya dominated areas, where party leaders spoke about how the influential community was deprived of its resources that was going to Muslims, and what the party would go to get the community’s lost glory back. </p><p>“The state government has not given any facility to them. They created two categories to help the Muslims instead. We are speaking to Mahishyas against this divide-and-rule policy,” said Ajit Das, president of the party’s state OBC cell. “Mahishya are a very big community and this vote will come to us.” </p><p>The TMC countered this, and accused the BJP of communal polarisation. “This is a political ploy. We brought so many Hindu communities like Ghosh and Pal into the OBC fold,” said Binay Krishna Barman, the state backward class welfare minister. The party is also hoping that the thousands of OBC certificates distributed last year as part of the Duare Sarkar (government at your doorstep) initiative, and the welfare schemes that sustain rural population will help the party gain support. Moreover, Banerjee’s sustained patronage of the Dakshineswar Temple has also endeared her to the local Mahishyas. </p><p><b>The demand for OBC status </b></p><p>Hindu OBC castes have never had significant electoral clout in Bengal because of the relatively small quantum of quota, and the party-society structure, where the ruling party governs all affairs in the countryside. </p><p>But the inclusion of the Mahishyas, which will inevitably require an expansion of the quota, has the potential to change that. “Mahishyas are already a stable community. With reservation, they can consolidate and become the equivalent of Yadavs, Jats or Marathas,if not in this election then in the next,” said Bandyopadhyay. </p><p>Of course, this is generating some concern from castes already included in the OBC fold. “We hope the quota will be expanded, because we are poor and need the benefits. We fear the Mahishyas will dominate resources,” said Ratul Ghosh, an OBC community activist. </p><p>The TMC-BJP tussle has laid bare the similarities of the Mahishya with the crisis faced by other middle castes such as Marathas or Jats. Mahishyas are proud, have community icons such as freedom fighter Birendranath Sasmal, and yet feel shortchanged by the agrarian distress and vanishing jobs, which make them more dependent on government jobs and quotas. </p><p>“Two separate commissions rejected our demand. After TMC came to power, we were told we didn’t qualify,” said Halder. This crisis is forcing the community to come together and rethink earlier voting patterns of decentralised voting. </p><p>This churn between deprivation and aspiration is most visible in the rural areas. And, it is here that the BJP and TMC are most desperate for the community’s support in a close election. </p><p>Jayanta Biswas, for example, is a schoolteacher in Nadia district’s Bhimpur village. The region is roughly 25km from the border, largely agrarian, and only four families out of 150-odd have a permanent job. “Everyone here is very poor and have been hit hard by the lack of our boys and girls in higher education. We cannot pull ourselves up without government support,” said Biswas. </p><p>For many older Mahishya activists, the electoral focus represents a full circle in the community’s journey. Uttam Sau, a resident of Howrah district, remembers that when in class 8, his teacher walked in one day and asked all SC students to stand up. “We didn’t understand so the teacher said SC means low caste. All the Mahishya students said, no no, we are not lower caste,” said Sau, secretary of the Bengal Mahishya association. </p><p>But over the years, he saw the gains made by the community fritter away as land holdings fragmented, young men migrated as labourers and political power remained elusive. “We fell behind, because community leaders failed to rouse and unite them. We weren’t educated, but OBC status can change all that. It can save us.” </p>","<p>Veteran actor and Samajwadi Party MP Jaya Bachchan would be campaigning for the ruling Trinamool Congress during the ongoing assembly elections in West Bengal from Monday, party leaders said. </p><p>While polls in 60 assembly constituencies have already been held in the first two phases, elections to the remaining 234 seats will be held in six more phases till April 29. </p><p>A senior TMC leader said that Bachchan would participate in at least four road shows on April 6 and 7 and may even share the stage with chief minister Mamata Banerjee in a public rally during her stay in the state till April 8. </p><p>The actor landed in at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata late on Sunday and was received by senior TMC leaders Derek O’Brien and Chandrima Bhattacharya. </p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election""><b>Click here for complete coverage of West Bengal assembly elections</b></a></p><p>Bachchan is likely to use her Bengal connection to bolster the TMC’s election campaign and the party’s main poll slogan ‘Bangla Nijer Meyekei Chay’ (Bengal wants its own daughter).</p><p>Bachchan is expected attend a roadshow at Tollygunge on Friday afternoon where BJP MP Babul Supriyo is pitted against TMC leader Arup Biswas.

Ramadoss is often perceived to have a knack for picking the winning side and his party has, in fact, served as a bellwether—the alliance the 1989-floated PMK has joined has often ended up winning the state assembly polls. </p><p>Will it work this time? </p><p><b>The reservation gambit </b></p><p>Ramadoss, 81, is barely seen on the campaign trail now days—he has been advised to remain indoors and campaigns from inside his car—but his successful attempt in getting the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to accede to the demand of allotting 10.5% internal reservation for Vanniyars has been a key talking point in these elections. </p><p>Vanniyars are dominant in northern and western Tamil Nadu and form the PMK’s core vote bank. An hour before the model code of conduct came into effect on February 26, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, as a last-minute resort, announced in the assembly the 10.5% quota under the existing 20% reservation for Most Backward Castes (MBC) for public jobs and education. In return, the following day, PMK reduced its settled for 23 seats and is the second-largest party in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), after the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is contesting in 20 seats. </p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/tamil-nadu-an-election-that-is-stalin-s-to-lose-101617562365172.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">Tamil Nadu: An election that is Stalin’s to lose</a></b></p><p>However, this legislation came after months of negotiations and protests. The PMK revived its four-decade old demand around November 2020 ahead of the elections and threatened to leave the NDA if it wasn’t implemented. Several rounds of talks between AIADMK ministers and Ramadoss had failed; the latter, then, came down from his original demand of 20% internal reservation. </p><p>In December 2020, PMK cadre, during a state-wide protest for the reservation, pelted stones on a train, created ruckus and brought traffic to a standstill as the Chennai Police sealed its borders to restrict them from entering the city. Later that month, Ramadoss, in a virtual general council meeting, had urged the PMK cadre to work like the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh—the BJP’s ideological parent. “RSS has ensured the victory for the BJP by reaching out to every nook and corner during elections and highlighting the party’s policies,” he had said. </p><p>But the exclusive reservation has caused a counter-polarisation among other castes across Tamil Nadu and has divided opinion even among Vanniyars in Villupuram, given the hasty passage of the Bill. Responses are also driven by perceptions of Ramadoss himself. </p><p>In Tindivanam, where Ramadoss lived and worked as a physician, he set up a clinic which has now grown into a go-to hospital for the locals. “Both my children were delivered in his hospital, he (Ramadoss) has that goodwill here for ensuring healthcare,” said Satish Babu, a businessman, a traditional AIADMK voter. Ramadoss continues to be addressed as “maruthuvar ayiah” (doctor sir) even by rival politicians. </p><p>However, many remain unaware of the reservation provided to them and Ramadoss is said to have urged his cadre to take this information door-to-door. “I will vote for mambazham (mango- PMK’s symbol)... that’s the symbol I’ve mostly seen here,” said a shopkeeper who sits across the hospital. From Tindivanam up to Mylai along the highway, PMK’s mango symbol is painted on the walls of most houses, with a few houses also bearing the symbols of DMK’s rising sun and AIADMK’s two leaves. </p><p>Beyond his hometown, Ramadoss’ support base dwindles in the district. “After all these years, it was passed in such a hurry only because of elections. God knows how long it would take for people to benefit from it,” said a Vanniyar farmer, S Ranganathan, in Villupuram assembly constituency. It is among the six assembly assembly segments in the district where AIADMK heavyweight, sitting MLA and law minister C Ve Shunmugam and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)‘s R Lakshmanan engaged in a tough contest. Both candidates belong to the Vanniyar community. </p><p>Ramadoss’s movement is seen as a catalyst for more Vanniyar representation in politics. But the reservation announcement hasn’t been enough to win over Ranganathan and several others in the community. They are unhappy with the government not doing enough for farmers, and for digitising the market, which ends up delaying the cash inflow in their hands. They haven’t met Ramadoss though he lives in Thailapuram, a village in Villupuram.</p><p>“We don’t know when the AIADMK or PMK will change their mind, we want to give the DMK’s Lakshmanan a chance,” said Ranganathan. “Reservation won’t be an issue in towns, no one even talks about it,” adds a hotelier T Sudarshan in Villupuram town. The DMK candidate, an orthopedic surgeon was an MP from the AIADMK but switched over to the opposition and is more familiar amongst the electorate as a physician and politician. “I’ll be more easily accessible to the candidates,” says Lakshmanan. </p><p>But there are others with whom the reservation announcement has resonated. </p><p>A Valliamma, 23, staunchly believes that the lives of members of the community would be better with the 10.5% reservation. She is a chartered accountant and her brother A Arun is a history graduate and they both don’t have jobs. “What even aiyah couldn’t do, Anumbami (Ramadoss son) has done now,” she says crediting the junior Ramadoss for the quota. “With this reservation we can avail jobs that we haven’t been able to get so far.” Vanniyars in the western belt such as in Salem have also rallied behind the announcement. </p><p><b>The history of the demand</b></p><p>This election season wasn’t the first time that the Vanniyar protests demanding reservations had turned violent. </p><p>In the late 1970s, Ramadoss brought a coalition of Vanniyar community groups together, which later came under the umbrella of the Vanniyar Sangam (Federation of Vanniyars). It continues to be the parent body of the PMK. In the 1980s, they carried out protests demanding MBC status for Vanniyars. At the peak of the protests, the state was paralysed for a week when trees were felled, highways were blocked and police under M G Ramchandran (MGR) as chief minister shot down 21 protestors. Locals point to the national highway which has come up where the violence took place decades ago. </p><p>MGR, at that time, was hospitalised in the United States and held discussions with the group on his return but he soon passed away in 1987. The agitations were quelled when the DMK came back to power and M Karunanidhi created 20% reservation for MBCs, and Vanniyars were among the 108 other caste groups that were included. </p><p><b><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">For complete coverage of Tamil Nadu assembly election, click here</a></b></p><p>The recent grievance is that Vanniyars hadn’t found benefited adequately within this framework of reservation. Previous chief ministers had treaded on this issue carefully. Tamil Nadu’s 69% reservation, above the 50% cap of the Supreme Court directive, has been protected by both DMK and AIADMK governments to ensure social justice. </p><p>Palaniswami too said that the Bill was passed based on the recommendation of the Justice Janarthanan Committee (who was heading the backward classes commission until 2018). Since the last caste-based census was conducted in 1983, the CM said that the reservation slab would be modified after the report filed by Justice A Kulasekaran Committee, which was appointed in December 2020, to collect quantifiable data on caste, communities and tribes. This has led to doubts on the implementation and the effectiveness of the Bill. </p><p><b>The backlash </b></p><p>The decision to carve out a separate quote for Vanniyars has, however, upset other castes. For instance, deputy chief minister O Paneersevam who belongs to the Thevar subsect of the Mukkulathor community sought to offset the disappointment by saying in his campaign that the reservation is only provisional. </p><p>The AIADMK and even the PMK have not frequently mentioned the reservation issue in their campaigns outside Vanniyar dominated areas. Ramadoss, who campaigned in Chennai last week was silent on the aspect and instead focussed on the ruling government’s welfare schemes. </p><p>A first time Dalit voter in the assembly segment of Vikravandi in Villupuram, who did not wish to be identified said that the exclusive reservation for Vanniyars has further consolidated their stance against the ruling combine. “Yes, there is anger,” she says. “How can one community be given importance over another. How is it just to sideline the rest?”</p><p>Villupuram has been a hotbed of caste tensions and seen violent clashes in the past between the Vanniyars and Dalits. A decade ago, Ramadoss had sought the dilution of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 be diluted saying that it was misused against non-Dalits. He stated that Dalit men were wooing upper caste girls which needed to be stopped. In 2012, in Dharmapuri, 20 Dalits died and more than 300 huts were torched after the a Vanniyar woman, Divya who had eloped and married a Dalit man, E Ilavarasan. PMK had denied accusations that it had any role in any caste-clashes.</p><p>At one point though, Ramadoss once carried the corpse of a Dalit man as Vanniyars had not allowed access to their area to reach the cremation ground. “Ramadoss will adapt to any scenario and strategy for electoral gains,” says political analyst Ravindran Duraisamy. “Other communities do not believe him but he is true to Vanniyars. He is an indefatigable worker which is how he has maintained PMK’s vote share at 5% for 30 years. This election, I think they will register around 3%.”</p><p>Since the 1990s, PMK has oscillated between the DMK and AIADMK for assembly and parliamentary elections. In 2016, for the first time, PMK went alone, projecting former union minister Anbumani Ramadoss as its chief ministerial candidate. He tried to shed their image as a “caste-party” and focussed on development but PMK drew a blank. </p><p>Ramadoss was unhappy that the PMK couldn’t establish itself with people, despite having faced six assembly and nine parliamentary elections. While the AIADMK has gone out of its way to appease the PMK to win over its social base, the DMK, under M Karunanidhi, cultivated several Vanniyar leaders over the years to resist Ramadoss’ dominance. </p><p>The polls on April 6 will indicate if the AIADMK’s gamble in the Vanniyar reservation pays off and determine the future of the PMK led by its polarising patriarch. </p>","<p>With the third phase of the West Bengal assembly polls in 31 constituencies slated for Tuesday, the countdown for the much-anticipated three-cornered battle has already begun in the state. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be seeking to breach several Trinamool Congress (TMC) bastions this time, while the Sanyukta Morcha, an alliance comprising the Left Front, the Indian Secular Front (ISF), and Congress, is also hoping to make a mark in areas where identity politics has gained ground.</p><p>205 candidates are in the fray in this round of polling, which will take place across the 31 assembly constituencies across three districts — South 24 Parganas, Howrah, and Hooghly. More than 78.5 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise and decide the fate of these candidates, most prominent among who include TMC minister Ashima Patra, BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta, and CPI(M) leader Kanti Ganguly.</p><p>Of these 31 seats going to polls on Tuesday, TMC won 29 of them in the 2016 assembly elections (15 seats in South 24 Parganas, 6 seats in Howrah, and 8 seats in Hooghly). The Left Front + Congress alliance secured the remaining 2 seats (1 in South 24 Parganas and 1 in Howrah).

Constituency: Tarakeswar (Hooghly)</p><p>Candidate: Swapan Dasgupta, BJP</p><p>Former Rajya Sabha MP and Padma Bhushan recipient Swapan Dasgupta came under the media spotlight in the run-up to the 2021 West Bengal assembly elections, since he left his post at the upper house of Parliament to contest the state polls from the Tarakeswar seat. A former journalist and academic, Dasgupta's works have been featured in a myriad of volumes on the intersectionality of Indian politics to subaltern studies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also held a poll campaign rally in Tarakeswar recently, providing a potential boost to Dasgupta's prospects. The former parliamentarian will be facing TMC's Ramendu Singha Roy in the 2021 assembly polls.</p><p>2. Constituency: Raidighi (South 24 Parganas)</p><p>Candidate: Kanti Ganguly, CPI-M</p><p>Veteran CPI-M leader Kanti Ganguly was a former minister in the Left Front government in West Bengal, serving first as the minister in charge of Sunderbans development, and later as sports and youth welfare minister after the death of Subhas Chakraborty in 2009. Although he lost the last two elections to TMC's celebrity candidate Debashree Roy, the CPI-M this time is banking on Ganguly's much-publicised relief work done in the aftermath of Cyclone Amphan's devastation in rural Bengal. He will take on TMC's Alok Jaldata and BJP's Shantanu Bapuli.</p><p>3. Constituency: Shyampur (Howrah)</p><p>Candidate: Tanushree Chakraborty, BJP</p><p>In Howrah's Shyampur, the BJP has fielded Bengali actor Tanushree Chakraborty against TMC's sitting MLA Kalipada Mandal. Congress has fielded Amitabha Chakraborty, whom Mandal had defeated over 26,000 votes in the 2016 Assembly elections. Recently, however, Tanushree Chakraborty was in the news for joining fellow BJP candidates Payel Sarkar and Srabonti Chatterjee aboard a vessel on the river Hooghly to celebrate Holi with Trinamool Congress candidate and maverick politician Madan Mitra. Dismissing questions over political differences, however, the leaders had called for forgetting political differences and celebrating the festival of colours.</p><p>4. Constituency: Dhanekhali (Hooghly)</p><p>Candidate: Asima Patra, TMC</p><p>In the Dhanekhali seat, TMC has renominated state minister Asima Patra. She is up against Tusar Majumdar of BJP and Anirban Saha of Congress. In 2016, it was a one-way contest with Patra comfortably winning the election upstaging All India Forward Bloc's Pradip Majumdar by a huge margin of 58,644 votes. However, the Hooghly district witnessed the BJP making significant inroads in the 2019 General Elections with party candidate Locket Chatterjee winning the Lok Sabha seat. It remains to be seen if the 2.49 lakh voters of Dhanekhali opt for sitting TMC MLA and state minister Asima Patra this time, or throw their weight behind the BJP or the Sanyukta Morcha.</p><p>5. Constituency: Arambagh (Hooghly)</p><p>Candidate: Sujata Mondal Khan, TMC</p><p>For the Arambagh seat in the third phase, TMC is fielding Sujata Mondal Khan, whose husband, Saumitra Khan, is a BJP MP from Bishnupur. Mondal, a former BJP member, had decided to switch to TMC, after which her husband sent her a legal divorce notice. In 2016, TMC's Krishna Chandra Santra won the election by defeating the Communist Party Of India (Marxist)'s Asit Malik by a margin of 36,457 votes.</p><p>-</p><p>The districts of Howrah and Hooghly hold great significance in the upcoming two phases of the West Bengal Assembly polls, where the BJP has increased its presence in the 2019 general elections. Furthermore, several TMC members - including former minister Rajib Banerjee from the Domjur constituency - have quit the party to join rival BJP. The district also saw a large number of high-profile campaigns in the run-up to the elections. In the constituencies of South 24 Parganas, development, employment and the havoc caused by cyclone Amphan are counted among the key issues. On the other hand, in the constituencies of Howrah and Hooghly, there has been visible development but it is the lack of employment opportunities that haunt the ruling TMC, reports ANI.</p>","<p>Kerala heads for a single-phase assembly elections on Tuesday under the security of 59,292 police personnel and 140 companies of central forces.Kerala Police chief Loknath Behra had on Saturday said that all security arrangements have been finalised for the smooth conduct of the assembly polls with a total of 59,292 police personnel and a drone system to detect crowds and obstruction of voters in the hinterlands on polling day.

Polling agents will be provided police protection if needed to travel from home to the polling station and back,"" the release said. </p>","<p>On the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River in Guwahati, we asked two vendors who they would support in this election. They answered simultaneously: “BJP,” said one; “Not BJP,” said the other. </p><p>The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporter continued, “I am a Hindu, so I vote for BJP. Ask which community he (the other vendor) is from,” — intimating that the other vendor was a Muslim. We stepped in to prevent a confrontational situation, but it soon became clear that the two men were friends. </p><p>This “casual” and complete Hindu-Muslim polarisation was evident in most political discussions, wherein the assumption was that a Hindu votes for the BJP and a Muslim votes for the mahajot (the alliance between Congress, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and Left parties). In common parlance, most people refer to “Hindu constituencies” and “Muslim constituencies” along with purported proportions of Hindus and Muslims in the constituency.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/assam-assembly-election/ec-tones-down-gag-order-on-himanta-biswa-sarma-to-24-hours-after-apology-101617456788748.html"" title=""www.hindustantimes.com"">EC tones down gag order on Himanta Biswa Sarma to 24 hours after apology</a></b></p><p>This polarisation has surrendered Assam to electoral arithmetic, where voters are bound by their identity to vote for a specific party. In 2016, the BJP and its ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) won 74 assembly constituencies, and led in 78 constituencies in 2019 (the Lok Sabha elections, when disaggregated into assembly constituencies). Similarly, the Congress and AIUDF (contesting separately) were ahead in 39 and 38 seats in 2016 and 2019, respectively. This electoral stability is due to the fact areas with large Hindu or Muslim majorities have also generated large margins of victory. </p><p>In the 2019 election, the average assembly constituency-wise margin of victory for the winning party was 23%, with only 18 (14%) of Assam’s 126 assembly constituencies showing a margin of victory less than 5%. This is important because it demonstrates that even a moderate level of anti-incumbency or pro-incumbency is unlikely to swing many seats in Assam.</p><p>This election seems to be also closer due to the arithmetic of Congress and AIUDF joining forces, and the BPF dropping the BJP in favour of the Congress. But given the electoral stability in Assam, it will require serious anti-incumbency, particularly in upper Assam where politics around the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) became consequential and Hindu-Muslim divisions are less salient, for the BJP to lose power in the state.</p><p>Voters express disquiet at this state of affairs. In Katlicherra constituency, one of the few places that saw a low margin of victory in 2019, the Hindu shopkeeper of a stationery store tells us, “To be honest, the BJP selected a poor candidate here, but I’ll vote for him. The MLA here (from AIUDF) visits Hindus and Muslims alike, and he has done work, but people from our community cannot vote for him. We used to show respect for each other here; I don’t know what has happened.” </p><p>We meet a group of middle-aged BJP supporters at a restaurant a few kilometres away who are certainly not lacking in anti-Muslim sentiment. But even they are concerned, with one saying, “If a Muslim comes into the area we always make sure he crosses safely to prevent conflict. I fear the youth here are looking for a fight.”</p><p>As we move to lower Assam, the sheer cruelty of electoral arithmetic becomes evident. In Bongaigaon, we meet an elderly man in a tea shop. He seems agitated, “What does it matter? The AGP always wins from here anyway. This is a Hindu seat.” As we continue talking, anger gives way to despondence, “They put my 86-year-old mother in jail. She is from Alipuduars (in neighbouring West Bengal), but they wouldn’t accept her papers. We tried everything.” The government accepted his father’s and his documents for the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC), but not those of his mother. Today, he must journey about 90 minutes each way to Kokrajhar to meet his mother at a detention facility. But there is no one to take up his fight. All around Assam, voters admit the NRC process was disruptive, messy, and unfair to the poor, but add that it is not a political issue — it’s only about demographics.</p><p>We visit the villages outside Gossaigaon, part of the Bodoland Territorial Region. In 2012, the homes of Muslim villagers were torched, under the watch of former rebel leader Hagrama Mohilarry and the BPF, in a bid to get them to leave their lands. Today, Muslims, who largely returned to the area, are being asked to vote for the BPF as a part of the alliance. </p><p>Outside a mosque, a man in his 60s tells us, “What other option do we have? (BJP leader) Himanta Biswa Sarma openly abuses Muslims now and says they don’t need our votes.” A Muslim man working at a local repair shop openly professes support for the BPF, “Of course I’m mad about what happened. But what will anger do? We have to live here and the BPF is the best party for us.” A quick survey of the area finds that the BPF is facing anti-incumbency and most of the Bodo population prefers the ascendant United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL). Ironically, if the BPF is to remain in power in the region, it will do so on account of the Muslim population that the party tried to remove from the area.</p><p>After all, it’s all about arithmetic.</p><p><i>Neelanjan Sircar is an assistant professor at Ashoka University and senior visiting fellow at Centre for Policy Research</i></p><p><i>The views expressed are personal </i></p>",,"<p>Entering the next stage of its high-voltage election battle, West Bengal will witness polling in the third phase of the Assembly election on Tuesday.

In the 2019 LS polls, the Congress alone won 68.6% of the state’s 140 assembly constituencies (ACs) if the results are disaggregated at the AC-level, which is the highest seat share won by the party in all Kerala assembly elections since 1965 and all Lok Sabha polls since 1999 (the earliest Lok Sabha election for which AC-level statistics are available with HT). The CPI(M) won just 11.4% of the ACs in 2019, the lowest AC-level seat share for the party in state polls since 1965 and LS elections since 1999.

Ernakulam has the second-lowest share of Hindu population among the 14 districts. The LDF has a bigger support from Hindus than among Muslims and Christians. The CPI(M) now also faces a threat from the BJP, which has taken up a share of Hindu votes. The CPI(M)’s retreat in Ernakulam could be aimed at making up for the loss of Hindu votes with Christian votes (Christians make up 38% of the population in the area) attracted by its allies. A district-level breakup for the Congress shows that it has increased the share of seats contested the most in Kottayam, which has the highest share of Christians among the state’s districts, and KEC(M) has support among Syrian Christians.</p>","<p>The third and final phase of polling in Assam – 40 of the state’s 126 assembly constituencies (ACs) vote on Tuesday – promises to be the most interesting and closely contested one. The ACs are all located in the Lower Assam region, which comprises 10 of the state’s 28 districts. While small parts of Baksa, Nalbari, and Kamrup districts have already voted in the second phase, the remaining seven districts – Dhubri, Kokrajhar, Chirang, Bongaigaon, Goalpara, Barpeta, and Kamrup Metropolitan – will vote in this phase.</p><p>The Congress and the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), with which the former has allied with, won 50% or more of the ACs in this phase in the 2009 (LS) and 2011 elections. Even in the 2014 LS polls, their combined AC-level seat share was higher than that of the BJP and the parties that the latter would go on to partner with in ensuing elections: the AGP and the BPF, which, in 2014, was the Congress’s ally. The decline in the Congress and AIUDF’s combined seat share in the 2014 election was because independents won nine ACs. When the BJP alliance did overtake the two parties in the 2016 state elections, it was mainly because independents didn’t win any seats. In the 2019 LS polls, the BJP alliance again fell behind the Congress and the AIUDF.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/assam-assembly-election"" target=""_blank"">Click here for complete coverage on Assam assembly election</a></p><p>Interestingly, independents may well call the shots in these 40 ACs, ensuring a tight contests. The median victory margin in these 40 constituencies was lower than that in those that voted in first two phases, in three of the five elections since 2009: 2011, 2016, and 2019.</p><p>Another factor that makes the contest more unpredictable is the nature of alliances. The BPF, a significant player in this phase, has gone back to the Congress alliance. The BJP has allied with United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) to make up for the loss of BPF.</p><p>The demographics of the region further underline the importance of alliances. The region perhaps offers the least room for winning polls by focusing on a single social, religious, or linguistic group. SCs, STs, and OBCs account for 18.3%, 14.5%, and 20.3% of the population here, compared to 15.8%, 13.6%, and 32.4% in the state.

With two of the state’s biggest leaders – J Jayalalithaa of the AIADMK and M Karunanidhi of the DMK – having died since 2016, this election will also be a test for their successors. While MK Stalin, son of Karunanidhi, has succeeded in the internal succession battle of the DMK, this election will be his most crucial test. In the AIADMK, while CM Edappadi K Palaniswami has made up with his deputy O Panneerselvam and blocked the re-entry, into the party, of his one-time mentor VK Sasikala, the party may face an identity crisis on account of its partnership with the BJP, seen as a North Indian, upper caste, Hindi speaking party.</p><p><a href=""https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election"" target=""_blank"">Click here for complete coverage on Tamil Nadu elections</a></p><p>How are these parties dealing with this crucial election?

The DMK contested 23 LS seats in 2019, 11 fewer than the 34 seats it contested in 2014, and offered the rest to allies. The result was a strike rate of 97.8% in the 138 ACs it contested. This has allowed the DMK to negotiate a seat sharing deal for this poll, whereby it is contesting on 173 seats, leaving 61 to its allies.

Its AC-level strike rate was 7.1%. The 2004 and 1996 elections, when DMK won big, are also the elections where the AIADMK’s strike rate was lower than in 2019. Yet, instead of giving away even more seats to its allies, the AIADMK decided to contest 191 of 234 ACs (which might include smaller parties contesting on the AIADMK symbol like the DMK). Barring 2016, the last time the party contested on a higher number of seats was in 1989, when it contested 198. This could be a response to the DMK attacking its alliance with the BJP. The BJP contested on 30 ACs in 2019 if the Lok Sabha seats are disaggregated to ACs. The AIADMK has offered it just 20 ACs in this election.</p><p>The challenge in terms of forming alliances for both the parties is similar. Both of them have a better strike rate against the alliance partners of their opponents. This explains their need for contesting a large number of seats in this election. However, they also need alliances for forming a coalition that appeals to OBCs and SCs, who constitute 88% of the state’s population. Between the 2016 and 2019 polls, the AIADMK suffered the most in terms of contested vote share in the Central and Chennai regions, which have a bigger share of SCs, than in the western and southern regions, which have a higher share of OBCs. The DMK gained the most in terms of contested vote share in the western region, which has the highest share of OBCs.</p>","<p> Voting for 40 constituencies in the third and final phase of the ongoing assembly polls in Assam began at 7.00am on Tuesday. </p><p>People were seen queuing outside many polling stations; with the weather department predicting clear skies, a high voter turnout is expected. </p><p>A total of 337 candidates (including 25 women) are contesting from 40 of the 126 seats in the state in the third phase.

Nandigram, where Trinamool Congress leader and chief minister Mamata Banerjee is taking on Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP is in category B, HT learns.</p><p>On record, however, the BJP says none of the 294 seats is difficult. “It is the first time our party has gone to 80,000 of the total 100,000 polling booths that we have across the state. We have classified them, but it is our internal preparation. It is our strategy but we hope that people will vote for us whichever category the constituency is,” said Kailash Vijayvargiya, national general secretary in charge of Bengal. Home minister Amit Shah has repeatedly said the BJP will win at least 200 seats.

The only Union minister contesting here will lose,” said Derek O’ Brien, TMCs leader in the Rajya Sabha.</p><p>“In the western districts of Bengal, the BJP did better in 2019, so they classify them as easier seats to win.

I am asking you to depute women as polling agents in a booth. Assign Kanyashree girls, who are getting scholarships and are at least 18, as polling agents.” </p><p>This is, however, not the first time that the TMC chief has urged women party workers to come forward. Banerjee had earlier too assigned them bigger roles, saying that they should hit the roads with kitchen utensils and broomsticks to counter the BJP. </p><p>“The BJP is bringing in goons from outside the state. I will urge the women to come out with ‘hata and khunti’ (kitchen utensil) and confront the goons.

Earlier also, she blamed the election commission and central forces for stopping her polling agents. But now, she is publicly accepting that her polling agents have started revolting against her.
