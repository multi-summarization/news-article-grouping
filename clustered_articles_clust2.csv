This was the second consecutive day when it added over 3 lakh new cases. No country so far has added these many cases for two consecutive days.Data collated by the WHO shows that there have been only two other occasions when new cases added by a country crossed 3,00,000 on a single day . This happened on December 20, 2020 and January 10, 2021 when the US added 4,02,270 and 3,13,516 new cases on a single day.If cases continue to grow at this rate then India will add about a million cases in three days â a feat that is unparalleled so far.No other country has seen such a level of new cases and evidently, the healthcare system of no other country has ever been so overwhelmed by Covid The impact of this level of cases â more than a lakh new cases for the 17th consecutive day is evident on the healthcare system and there is a steady increase in daily fatality.For the 10th consecutive day, India has witnessed over a thousand daily deaths of which the last three days saw over 2,000 daily deaths. In the past 10 days over 15,000 people have died because of Covid or related complications.Among states, Maharashtra continues to lead with 67,013 new cases."

0,"Violence mars 6th phase of polls, over 79% voter turnout"," Injuries to two people in police firing and stray incidents of violence marked the sixth phase of polling in West Bengal on Thursday that was largely peaceful across four districts and held amid an alarming spike in coronavirus infections in the state. Polling was held for nine seats each in North Dinajpur and Nadia, 17 in North 24 Parganas, and eight in East Burdwan district. Provisional turnout stood at 79.09 %, comparatively lower than the polling percentage recorded in the first five phases. In the sixth phase, 306 candidates were in the fray. “Polling was today conducted peacefully in 14,480 polling stations,” the election commission (EC) said in a statement. With the sixth phase, polling has been held now for 223 of 294 seats. At Bagda in North 24 Parganas, a mob allegedly attacked a state police team, injuring a constable and the officer-in-charge of Bagda police station, EC officials said. When police fired three rounds to disperse the mob, two villagers suffered leg injuries. The incident triggered a slugfest between Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders. “Police opened fire on innocent villagers. Even the state police are now under the control of the EC,” said TMC spokesperson Snehasish Chakraborty. “The attack on the state police was an outcome of the instigating speeches by chief minister Mamata Banerjee. Four men were killed at Sitalkuchi in north Bengal (on April 10) when central forces opened fire in self defence. Before that incident, Banerjee asked people to attack central forces,” said BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar. Voting took place amid a spike in coronavirus infections. The state reported more than 10,000 infections on Wednesday and 11,948 on Thursday. Fifty-six people died in Bengal between Wednesday and Thursday morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled the four rallies he was to address in Bengal on Friday. “Tomorrow, will be chairing high-level meetings to review the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Due to that, I would not be going to West Bengal,” Modi tweeted. He was supposed to address a rally at the Shahid Minar grounds in the heart of Kolkata. Union home minister Amit Shah, who addressed a rally in South Dinajpur district where polls will be held on April 26, said by the time polling in the sixth phase ends, the BJP will secure an absolute majority. “But we still want you to vote for us so that BJP gets over 200 seats.” In North 24 Parganas district, TMC and BJP workers clashed in Ashoknagar, Barrackpore and Bijpur. BJP workers alleged that six people sustained splinter injuries when bombs went off at Ashoknagar. TMC workers blamed central forces for opening fire on them and said a man was shot in his leg. Central paramilitary officers posted in the area dismissed the allegation saying no shots were fired anywhere. The EC sought a report from the local administration as the election watchdog’s police observer, Navin Kumar, rushed to the area. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy’s son, Subhranshu Roy, who was contesting from Bijpur seat in North 24 Parganas, alleged that bombs were hurled at their supporters. Mukul Roy contested the Krishnanagar North seat in Nadia district against actress Kaushani Mukherjee (TMC). “I was gheraoed by BJP workers in some areas when I was visiting polling booths,” alleged Mukherjee. Shah and chief minister Mamata Banerjee held rallies in districts where polls will be held in the last two phases on April 26 and 29. Addressing a rally in Malda district, where Muslims comprise majority of the population, Banerjee said: “There was a time when some people were in the CPI(M). They terrorised people. Now, the same people are in the BJP and still terrorising people... I will never let the BJP enforce the National Population Register and National Register of Citizens in Bengal, not as long as I am alive.” "
1,O2 supply up but hosps may still need to cap its use,"NEW DELHI: The government may be able to ramp up oxygen supply for medical use by another 11-12% to around 7,000 metric tonnes following restrictions imposed on the use by industry, but a further increase may be possible once imports start flowing in.Over the last few days, supply of oxygen for medical use has been significantly enhanced to meet the rising demand from Covid patients, although most states and hospitals are demanding more.While oxygen for medical use constituted just over a third of the production at the start of the month, it went up to around 55% along with higher output, and was estimated to be more 77% of the production on Tuesday, according to data available with the Centre.Production too has been increased to around 113% of the capacity (see graphic).âNow that only the nine identified industrial segments will receive oxygen, there will be more supply for medical use. It may be around 7,000 MT in the coming days,â a government source told TOI.Given the current production capacity, it may be tough to stretch beyond current levels and as a result, supply for medical use will also need to be capped at a certain level. This will mean that hospitals will need to use the available resources better till more supplies come in â a challenge given the rising burden of infections and higher number of patients needing breathing support.Earlier this week, the government had decided to limit supplies only to a handful of industries including pharma , nuclear power plants, steel units and oil refineries.Following the rise in cases across several states, the allocation formula has been tweaked with Maharashtra , which has the highest number of cases for several weeks now, getting the highest allocation of 1,425 metric tonnes a day, a 37% jump over the earlier level. The highest increase has been made in the case of Kerala , with Delhi too seeing a 67% jump."
1,Steps taken to resolve the crisis,"MHA has directed states and UTs to ensure the following:• No restriction on movement of medical oxygen between states•No restrictions of oxygen manufacturers or suppliers to supply only hospitals in the state/UT where they are located.•Free movement of oxygen-carrying vehicles into all cities and towns•No authority must attach oxygen vehicles passing through their state/district to make specific supplies in their area•Supply of oxygen for industrial purposes halted from Thursday, till further orders24*7 control room in Delhi: DDMA sets up 24*7 control room to redress grievances, complaints from city hospitals within 30 minutes"

The crisis in the country is not just due to coronavirus but also because of “anti-people” policies of the central government, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Thursday, and called for a solution instead of hollow speeches.

He also attacked the government, alleging it has brought destruction and has turned the middle-class poor.

The Congress has been targeting the government over its management of the COVID-19 situation in the country.

“I am quarantined at home and sad news is constantly coming in. The crisis in India is not just due to Corona, but due to the anti-people policies of the central government. Don’t give false celebrations and hollow speeches, give the country a solution,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.

In another tweet, he said, “The poor are not just a number, they are living people and hundreds of helpless families. Crushing the middle-class and turning them poor, the BJP government has shown how destruction can be done.”

Gandhi also cited a media report claiming that India has been added to the list of countries having collective poverty after a span of 45 years.

The Congress leader tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week. He reported mild symptoms and has been quarantined at home.

Gandhi also took to Instagram, saying he has hope and faith that the people of the country will defeat the virus by working together.

“One day we will hug again. I have hope and faith in the human spirit, in the Indian spirit. We will heal. We will defeat this virus and we will do it by working together,” he said.

“I want to thank all our healthcare workers & front line workers for their sacrifice & continued dedication, and the hundreds and thousands of Indian citizens going above and beyond to help their fellow countrymen. Each one of you gives us hope,” Gandhi added.

India registered over 3.14 lakh new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest-ever single-day count recorded in any country, taking its infection tally to 1,59,30,965."
2,Maulana Wahiduddin Khan: The advocate of religious harmony who told Muslims to relinquish Babri claims,"Maulana Wahiduddin Khan advocated peaceful coexistence in a multi-ethnic society which won him thousands of admirers, but also provoked the hardliners or a section of the Muslim community.

“All his life he said what he really believed in. He did not care about what people would say or how they would react. So some people liked him so much, some people did not like him but it did not deter him. He kept on saying what he really believed in.”

This is how Zafarul Islam Khan remembers his father, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, the noted Islamic scholar, spiritual leader and author who died of Covid complications on Wednesday. He was 97.

Khan was a towering personality not just in India but across the Islamic world. Known for his Gandhian views, he advocated peaceful coexistence in a multi-ethnic society, which won him thousands of admirers. But his views also provoked hardliners or a section of the Muslim community.

For instance, his views on the Ayodhya dispute, asking Muslims to relinquish claims over Babri Masjid site, riled many.

In 1993, he wrote in an article: “The issue of Ayodhya’s Babri Masjid has turned into one of life and death for the Muslim community. The tragic event of December 6 gave a serious jolt to the conscience of the country. What was deplorable was that it made a mockery of the promises by the leaders of the Ram Mandir movement. Given all these factors, the destruction of the mosque was not simply the demolition of a structure; it was akin to the negation of an entire history.”

Saddened by the passing away of Maulana Wahiduddin Khan. He will be remembered for his insightful knowledge on matters of theology and spirituality. He was also passionate about community service and social empowerment. Condolences to his family and countless well-wishers. RIP. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 22, 2021

But he advanced a three-point peace formula, which he said could solve the problem provided the Hindus, Muslims and the government abided by it. He said the “movement launched by the Hindus should be stopped at Ayodhya”.

“Assurance to this effect could take the form of a written declaration signed by all the four Shankaracharyas and by responsible people belonging to those Hindu organisations involved in the mandir-masjid movement. This should expressly state that after Ayodhya’s Babri mosque no mosque’s right to continued existence will ever again be challenged by the Hindus…”

On their part, he said the Muslims should preserve a strict silence on the issue of Ayodhya. “If the protection of the Babri Masjid was their responsibility, they have now discharged it by the sacrifices they have made. Now they have reached a point where there is very little else that they can do. As such, Muslims should consciously resolve to distance themselves entirely from this issue. Till now they have been forced to take up this cause, but henceforth they should leave it to the conscience of the nation,” he said.

The government of India, he said, should pass the Places of Worship Act in 1991, maintaining the status quo as on August 15, 1947, in order to guarantee the security of all places of worship.

He also embarked on a peace march through Maharashtra along with Acharya Muni Sushil Kumar and Swami Chidanand after the Babri Masjid demolition.

In 2003, he wrote another article saying it is time Muslims must bring to an end all violent activities and devote their energies to achieving a two-point formula of education and dawah. “Education will bring their succeeding generations into line with modern standards, and dawah work will provide them with a global mission through which they will be able to chalk out a proper line of action for themselves,” he wrote.

His son Zafarul Islam Khan said, “Millions in India and other countries admired him for what he said. He basically wanted to bring people together, to forget past acrimonies, to start a new life…forgiving was very important to him… that is what he preached.”

Khan was a known peace activist. Earlier this year, the Narendra Modi government honoured him with the Padma Vibhushan. On Thursday, Modi tweeted: “Saddened by the passing away of Maulana Wahiduddin Khan. He will be remembered for his insightful knowledge on matters of theology and spirituality. He was also passionate about community service and social empowerment. Condolences to his family and countless well-wishers. RIP.”

A recipient of Padma Bhushan and Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavna Award, Khan authored some 200 books, including a commentary and translation of the Quran in English, Hindi and Urdu. He edited a weekly publication of Jamiat Ulema Hind in the 1960s before starting his own venture Al-Risala in 1976. His book ‘God Arises’ is part of the curricula of universities in over six Arab countries."

MHA directs states to ensure uninterrupted supply

SC terms Covid situation 'national emergency'

Centre to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals: HC

Haryana allocates 140 MT of oxygen to Delhi

'Green corridor' in Delhi

Why has the demand for oxygen increased

What do the experts say

(With inputs from PTI)

NEW DELHI: The second wave of Covid 19 has hit India like a ""storm"", putting immense pressure on the country's health infrastructure.It has also triggered an unprecedented demand for oxygen and beds which has caused serious shortage in hospitals across the country.The Centre on its part has suspended the industrial use of oxygen and diverted the gas for medical use.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting to review the oxygen supply across the country and discuss ways and means to boost its availability.The Prime Minister asked top officials to work rapidly on increasing its production, boosting the speed of distribution and using innovative ways to provide oxygen support to health facilities.He also said that states must act against any hoarding of oxygen and directed officials to ensure that the oxygen supply to various states happens in a smooth, unhindered manner and called for fixing responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction.The Centre directed states to ensure uninterrupted production and supply of medical oxygen and its transport along inter-state borders.It said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of the district concerned will be held responsible if there is any violation of its order.The directive under the stringent Disaster Management Act 2005 was issued by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla in the wake of reports that some states blocked supply of medical oxygen to other states amid sudden spike in coronavirus cases and demand for it.Those who are found to be violating the order will be punishable up to one year of jail or fine or both.Bhalla said the availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19 and with the increasing cases, the medical oxygen supply will need to keep pace with the requirements of the states and union territoriesThe Supreme Court on Thursday termed the Covid situation as almost a ""national emergency"".It also agreed to hear Vedanta's plea for opening up of its Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce thousand tonnes of oxygen and give it free of cost to treat patients.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was unimpressed with the objection of Tamil Nadu government which initially sought hearing of Vedanta's plea on Monday and opposed its opening on various grounds including that it has been rejected by the apex court earlier.""There is almost a national emergency and you (Tamil Nadu) don't put spokes in the solution. We will hear it (plea of Vedanta) tomorrow,"" the bench said in the hearing conducted through video conferencing.""The country is in dire need of oxygen and the Centre is augmenting oxygen from whichever source. Vedanta wants to make its plant operational, but let Vedanta only make it operational to manufacture oxygen for health purposes,"" solicitor general Tushar Mehta said.The Delhi high court on Thursday observed that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has turned âprecariousâ with many hospitals running out of oxygen and directed the Centre to ensure the gas is supplied to the city as per the planned allocation and without any hindrances.""We all know that this country is being run by god,"" observed an anguish bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which was of the view that all measures should be taken for removing obstructions in the transportation of oxygen.If the government wants it can do anything and can even make âheaven meet earth,â it said.On Wednesday, the court had rebuked Centre over the oxygen crisis in Delhi and other cities, asking it to ""beg, borrow or steal"" to ensure that oxygen reaches hospitals.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.The Haryana government on Thursday allotted 140 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen produced in Panipat to the national capital.The move came after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help from his Haryana counterpartManohar Lal Khattar to facilitate the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi.""I spoke to CM of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar. Sought his support in facilitating the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi. He has assured full support,"" Kejriwal said in a tweet earlier in the day.Separately, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, alleging that tankers carrying oxygen were not able to reach hospitals in the national capital as they were being stalled by police and officials in UP and Haryana.With oxygen shortage gripping the national capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked the Delhi Police to create ""green corridor"" for all oxygen tankers from point of entry to designated destination.""To monitor movement of oxygen tankers, Delhi Police will keep record of entry, exit of such vehicles through various checkpoints,"" it said.It has also set up a 24x7 control room to redress grievances and complaints from city hospitals regarding shortage within 30 minutes.Two senior IAS officers have also been appointed to ensure smooth movement of tankers and seamless supply to health establishments in DelhiIn an order, the DDMA has also directed all Delhi hospitals to form ""audit committees"" to supervise and rationalise the use of medical oxygen.The second wave of the Covid pandemic has seen an increased demand for oxygen as a significant number of people are suffering from Covid-induced respiratory complications.This has led to panic and people are trying to keep oxygen cylinders handy.As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director-general, Dr Balram Bhargava, the oxygen requirement in the second wave of Covid-19 stood at 54.5 per cent as compared to 41.5 per cent in the first wave.Bhargava also said that while the demand for oxygen has increased proportionately in the second wave, the demand for ventilator has not been high.However, experts have cautioned against the waste of oxygen by those who are taking it intermittently to boost their oxygen levels out of fear.According to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, healthy individuals with oxygen saturation in the range of 93-94 per cent do not need to take high-flow oxygen just to maintain their saturation at 98-99 per cent.""Oxygen is a treatment, it is like a drug,"" Guleria said to drive home the point that taking it intermittently is an absolute waste of oxygen.""There is no data that shows that intermittent use of oxygen will be of any help to the patients and is, therefore, ill-advised,"" he added.Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta Hospital, has urged people not to use oxygen as a ""security blanket"".According to Dr Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayana Health, oxygen saturation of above 94 per cent is not a problem and a doctor may be consulted if it dips after exercise or effortful work."
4,"Maharashtra taking urgent steps to combat Covid surge, HC told","Mumbai The Bombay high court while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the mismanagement of the second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra on Thursday was assured by the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that appropriate measures were being taken to ensure equitable distribution of life-saving drugs and oxygen.As the hearing was on, additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that a web portal had carried a report that the Chief Justice of India had taken suo motu cognisance of all Covid-related public interest litigations (PIL) being heard by high courts and decided to hear all petitions together on Friday, with senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae. Singh informed the court that it could not continue hearing the case further and that the Supreme Court will deal with the supply of oxygen, essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and powers of the state to declare a lockdown. However, as the SC was yet to issue an order staying the hearing in the HC or seeking transfer of petitions, the HC bench continued the hearing. The HC bench, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was taking urgent steps to combat the spread. Pointing to the shortage of oxygen and life-saving drugs like remdesivir, he submitted the Centre had announced that it would take care of it from May 1. On a query by the court on the availability till April 30, Kumbhakoni submitted that measures such as asking suppliers to hand over the medicines directly to the collector who, in turn, would distribute it to hospitals were put in place. To this, the court said there has to be a portal on availability of essential Covid-19 drugs. Referring to a news report from last year which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, “Had we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have been arisen.” “You should realise this is an emergency situation,” said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should be stopped. With regard to the availability of Covid-19 tests, the state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing and having a uniform rate for the medicines would be considered. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients. “The shortage is because the middle class and upper class are now affected and they want a bed in a hospital of their choice. When the same is not available, it is depicted as shortage, while closeby hospitals may have vacant beds,” said Kumbhakoni. The court accepted the suggestions of Purohit and advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for an intervener, on the use of print and electronic media to spread awareness on the measures and to curb panic.The court also sought to know from the state the effects of Covid-19 on smokers and said that till the virus is not eradicated, the state and the Centre should consider banning smoking and consumption of tobacco products. Reacting to the Nashik oxygen leak that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday, the court said, “How can this happen in a civilised society? While the oxygen supply is less, there is leakage. It is of concern. This is not what we expect from a responsible government.” The HC said the Centre and the state should set aside politicking and concentrate on tackling the problems. The court scheduled the next hearing for May 6. "
4,"Rafale weaponry prompts China, Pak to alter defence posture","With the Indian Air Force’s (IAF) Rafale fighter successfully test-firing the 60km range Hammer air-to-ground modular weapon in March, the air defence posture of both has changed in the wake of the advent of the multi-role fighter in South Asia, according to people familiar with the matter.The Hammer weapon secured a bunker-busting vertical hit on its target at the testing location. According to top South Block officials, with the IAF’s first Rafale squadron just one short of completion in Ambala, the Chinese have moved their so-called fifth generation fighter J-20 ahead in the Tibet and Xinjiang airbases. The Pakistanis have also moved their Chinese import JF-17 fighter in key forward bases to tackle the clear and present threat of the Rafale fighter. Although the Chinese say the J-20 is the third operational fifth-generation fighter after the US F-22 and F-35, genuine fifth-generation fighters developed by the Americans do not have a canard that further reduces the cross-section of the plane, the officials said. The Chinese J-20 has the same canard as the Rafale, which the IAF calls a 4.5-generation fighter.The has also undergone a change with IAF’s induction of the Rafale as the latter carries the Meteor air-to-air missile, whose range is way beyond any missile the other two forces have in their arsenal. The Hammer and Scalp air-launched cruise missile with a range of over 500km ensures that the adversary will have no early warning as the two weapons can be launched from within Indian territory and beyond visual range.While India could only send three out of five readied fighters from the Merignac Bordeaux airbase in France on Wednesday due to unforeseen reasons, seven more fighters have been lined up for delivery to IAF next month. Although the seven fighters may come in batches of three and four, six of them will be flown to the Hashimara airbase in West Bengal via Ambala. The re-pavement and extension of the main runway at Hashimara, which sits astride the Siliguri corridor, is expected to be completed by this month-end. The Haishmara upgrade also includes blast pens and surface-to-air missile batteries to protect the vital base."
5,"India, US announce clean energy initiative","Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday announced the launch of a joint climate and clean energy initiative with the United States to “mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies and enable green collaborations” in India that could also “create templates of sustainable development” for other developing countries.PM Modi, speaking at the Leaders Summit on Climate convened by US President Joe Biden on Thursday, did not announce any changes or upgrades to commitments under the Paris Agreement but underlined that India was already doing its part and that the country’s per capita carbon emissions are 60% lower than the global average.Biden opened the summit with an ambitious pledge to cut the US’s greenhouse gases in half by 2030 and called on other nations to “set higher climate ambitions” that will create jobs, advance innovative technologies and help countries vulnerable to the impact of climate change”.“We in India are doing our part. Our ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030 shows our commitment. Despite our development challenges, we have taken many bold steps on clean energy, energy efficiency, afforestation and biodiversity. We are among few countries whose NDCs (nationally determined contribution, under the Paris climate deal) are 2 degree C compatible,” PM Modi said in an address to 40 other world leaders who participated in the two-day summit called by Biden. “President Biden and I are launching the India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 partnership. We will help mobilise investment, demonstrate clean technologies and enable green collaborations,” he added.No details were available yet on the India-US initiative, but on a visit to India last month, Biden’s special envoy on climate, John Kerry, said that “huge investments” will be forthcoming in India by the US and other countries in return for “some changes by India”.Earlier this month, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar underscored India’s prerogative to balance development goals with obligations on the climate crisis, saying that India will attempt to keep its climate commitments but will not act at the behest or under pressure from developed countries.According to a White House statement, Biden’s move to upgrade the country’s NDCs on Thursday will steer the world towards achieving the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C.The Climate Action Tracker, however, said that the US will need to do even more. Instead of the revised aim to cut 50-52% in national emissions, it will need to shave off at least 57-63% emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and provide support to other countries to meet the Paris goals.Following the US’s announcement, independent experts said it is time for all countries, including India, to scale up action against climate crisis.“President Biden’s upgraded NDC is a game changer. For too long the US has not put out an aggressive emissions reduction target. All countries could benchmark their lack of progress against the US... It’s time for all nations including India to upgrade action. As per the Climate Action Tracker, India’s NDC is 2°C compliant but not 1.5°C target compliant. We should ramp up action for our own good,” said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment.“The new US climate target is a step in the right direction: all major economies should be shifting towards cutting their emissions at least 50% by 2030,” tweeted Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the Paris agreement.In its Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) submitted in February, India said it has progressively decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions and it was on track to meet its voluntary declaration to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020. The report, however, also noted that India’s reliance on coal will continue to meet the country’s energy needs.On Thursday, President Xi Jinping reiterated that China’s carbon emissions will peak before 2030 and the country will achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that Japan aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The United Kingdom too led with a target of cutting emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.The summit, termed by Biden as a milestone leading up to the UN Climate Change Conference 2021 in Glasgow this November, was also attended by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Germany’s Angela Merkel, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Russia’s Vladimir Putin."
5,‘National health emergency’: SC asks Centre for plan today,"NEW DELHI: A day after Indiaâs daily new Covid-19 cases crossed the grim 3-lakh mark amid desperate cries for oxygen in hospitals, the Supreme Court on Thursday on its own took cognisance of what it called a ânational health emergency situationâ and asked the Centre to furnish within 24 hours a national plan on bolstering supply of oxygen, medicines, treatment and vaccines.As the surge of the pandemic laid bare the chinks in the countryâs health infrastructure with many patientsâ kin unable to find scarce hospital beds, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices L N Rao and S Ravindra Bhat decided to step in and seek an action plan from the Centre by Friday.Noticing that as many as six high courts had taken up proceedings on treatment of Covid-19 patients and passed orders that could affect distribution of precious resources like oxygen and medicines, the bench asked the Centre to respond on three issues â setting up a national body for equitable distribution of these resources, considering important medicines and medical equipment along with oxygen as essential commodities under ESMA, and logistics for seamless inter-state distribution of medicines and oxygen.The CJI-led bench said, âPrima facie, we are inclined to take the view that distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of health authorities which undoubtedly takes into account relevant factors like severity, susceptibility, the number of people affected and the local availability of resources.âWe expect the central government to place before this court a national plan for dealing with the above services and supplies during the pandemic. In these circumstances, we direct that notices be issued to the Union government, state governments/Union Territories and the parties who appeared to have approached the high courts to show cause why uniform orders be not passed by this court in relation to supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination, and declaration of lockdown.""The hearing also saw the bench cajoling the Tamil Nadu government to allow reopening of Vedantaâs Sterlite copper plant in Tuticorin specifically for producing 1,000 tonnes of medical oxygen. The plant was shut down because of violation of pollution norms.Referring to orders passed by the HCs of Delhi, Bombay, Sikkim, Calcutta, Allahabad and Gujarat, the bench said they had passed certain orders âwhich may have the effect of accelerating and prioritising the services to a certain set of people and slowing down the availability of these resources to certain other groups whether the groups are local, regional or otherwiseâ.The Delhi HC had on Wednesday told the Centre to âbeg, borrow or stealâ oxygen for supplying to Delhi hospitals. A few days ago, Allahabad HC had ordered the UP government to enforce complete lockdown in five major cities â Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Varanasi and Gorakhpur â to contain the spread of Covid-19. The SC had stayed the order on April 20.The apex court bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to submit a national action plan by Friday morning. Mehta said the Centre was working round the clock to augment the supply of oxygen and mentioned an application by Vedanta seeking to restart its copper plant in Tuticorin only for the purpose of producing medical oxygen.Appearing for Vedanta, senior advocate Harish Salve said the plant could produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen every day and Vedanta was ready to supply it to the government free of cost. ""If permitted, we can start production in five or six days,"" he said.But the Tamil Nadu government, through senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, said the plant was closed because of noxious discharge damaging the environment and it was not sure about the consequences on the environment by permitting reopening of the plant. He said the SC had earlier rejected Vedanta's plea for reopening of the plant, which was closed in 2018.Mehta said the country urgently needed medical oxygen supply. ""If there was a choice between saving the environment and human lives, the government would go for saving lives,"" he said. The bench cajoled the TN government and said it should not put a spoke in the production of oxygen and assured that it would judicially ensure that the plant operated only for producing oxygen. Vedantaâs application will also be heard on Friday. The SC appointed Salve and advocate Anuradha Dutt as amici curiae in the proceedings on the national plan for Covid management."
6,"14 held for abduction of 3 ONGC employees in Assam, ULFA-I role confirmed","The police in Assam’s Sivasagar arrested 14 people on Thursday in connection with the abduction of three employees of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). Police officials confirmed the role of the banned United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) in the abductions. Search operations are underway in neighbouring Nagaland where the abducted persons are believed to have been kept. “Till Thursday evening we have arrested 14 people on suspicion of their involvement in the abductions. Further investigations are underway,” said Amitabh Sinha, superintendent of police, Sivasagar. The three employees were abducted from a work over rig site inside the Lakwa tea estate in the early hours of Wednesday. The abducted employees are Ritul Saikia, Mohini Mohan Gogoi (both junior engineer assistants) and Alakesh Saikia (junior technician)—all of them belong to Assam. According to the police, 5 armed persons came to the rig site in an ONGC ambulance and abducted the 3 employees at gunpoint. The ambulance was recovered later close to the Assam-Nagaland border, around 11 km away. “It is now confirmed that ULFA-I was responsible for the abductions. The police are not yet aware of any ransom demand made by the outfit for the release of the abducted persons,” said Singha. “We suspect the abducted persons were taken to Nagaland. A search operation with involvement of different agencies is underway at present in Nagaland to rescue the ONGC employees,” he added. "
6,Finalise complaints against officials within 3 months: CVC to ministries,"The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has written to all Union ministries and departments under them to finalise complaints against government officers within three months so that vigilance clearances are not held up indefinitely.The apex body, in a communication sent on Monday, said it had observed from proposals received by the commission for vigilance clearances that complaints against employees often stay on their vigilance profiles without any further movement.“This has led to a situation where the vigilance clearance is being delayed or denied for no fault of the employee,” the CVC order said. It asked the ministries and departments to take such complaints against employees to their “logical conclusion” within three months of the date of receipt of the complaint.“Logical conclusion here implies that the decision shall be taken by the organisation to either file the complaint, or register a vigilance case for further investigation, or register a non-vigilance administrative action case for further investigation,” the CVC order said.“As a pilot, to begin with, the backlog complaints received till December 31, 2020 shall be disposed of according to the guidelines issued in this circular and compliance reported by May 31, 2021,” the order added.At the end of the third month from the date of receipt of a complaint, and after deciding the course of action, a copy of the complaint shall be made available to the employee concerned within 15 days through speed post, it said. If the name of the employee is not explicitly mentioned, a copy of the complaint will be made available to the staff concerned at the stage of registration of a vigilance or non-vigilance case, the order further said.Subsequently, if a decision has been made to take up the matter as a vigilance case, the organisation concerned shall send its inquiry report to the commission or Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) seeking advice within three months of registration of such a case, it added.Lauding the directive, former ONGC chairman R S Sharma said: “These investigations drag on for months, sometimes years and at the time of empanelment of an officer, these are brought out to deny promotion or other due benefits. Delay in completing these investigations leads to harassment. The CVC directive is appreciable. It is in the interest of natural justice.”"
7,Change in vaccine registration policy leads to confusion at Thrissur’s Elanad health centre,"Written By Aneesa PA

Sixty-year-old Janaki reached the Family Health Centre at Elanad in Thrissur district at 7 am on Thursday to get vaccinated after spot registration. But little did she know that the Kerala Health Department had scrapped its spot registration policy for Covid-19 vaccination a day earlier. “If they had informed us earlier, it would have been easier. I am getting old and had to depend on the bus to reach here. I can’t come here every day,” said Janaki, who had come here from Vennur village, 5 km away from the health centre.

She said that she had to return home on Saturday as well without getting vaccinated. “The hospital said there was no vaccine available there.”

The cancellation of the spot registration policy on Wednesday led to confusion in several parts of the state.

“Until yesterday, the public could register with the help of Rapid Response Team (RRT) for the vaccination and complete it in the respective vaccination centres that they prefer. But following the rush at vaccination centres, the health department’s new order made registration through COWIN portal mandatory to get the vaccination at a fixed day and time,” said Dr. Jafar Sadiq, Medical Officer in-charge of Vaccination at the Family Health Centre, Elanad.

Almost 1,000 people showed up Thursday morning at the Family Health Centre at Elanad, said a staff nurse, who requested anonymity.

“Most of them were unaware of the new rule that the department imposed yesterday. Hence, they came for spot registration. But they dispersed within an hour as soon as we explained the new situation,” she said.

The Covid-19 vaccination drive in the state is coordinated with the public through local bodies with the help of RRT (Rapid Response Team), consisting of ASHA workers and health workers.

“We went to take the vaccine only because ASHA workers demanded us to do it yesterday, we thought the registration process was complete as we received a reference ID on our mobile phones,” said a 47-year-old woman requesting anonymity.

Limy CK, Health Inspector at the Family Health Centre said one of the reasons for the confusion might have been the lack of time.

“We had a meeting for the whole department including ASHA workers at the Panchayat at 2 pm yesterday. But they might not have got the time to tell the public about the new policy in that short period,” she said.

According to her, the health system is also grappling with a lack of staff and vaccines shortage at this time. “The vaccines were not delivered to us until Wednesday evening since Saturday. So, we stopped the vaccination programme for four days,” she said.

She also said, currently there are only 9 health staff (Doctors not included) for the Elanad Family Health Centre and nearby Pazhayannur Community Health Centre in the district.

“With this staff, we are running RT-PCR test, immunisation for kids, and regular works apart from vaccination,” she said."
7,Vaccine wastage to hit allocation to states,"NEW DELHI: Wastage of anti-Covid shots will be a criteria negatively impacting allocation of stocks from the Centreâs kitty to states and UTs from May 1.The measure is intended to encourage better use of vaccinations as the demand will need to be more carefully managed once 50% of vaccine production in India becomes available for states and private hospitals from May 1.At present, Tamil Nadu , Haryana, Bihar and Rajasthan are among big states with an over 6% wastage, whereas Assam has the highest of 9.6% with Manipur recording 8.4%. Others like Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi also have over 5% wastage of vaccines, official data show. Among the better performing states are Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram and Goa with zero wastage.As per the new policy, vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly doses to the Centre and would be free to supply the remaining doses to state governments and in the open market at a pre-declared price. The Centre, from its share, will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on extent and curve of infection (number of active Covid cases) and performance (speed of administration). Apart from these, wastage of vaccine will also be weighed, the government has said.Given that supply of vaccines will be limited, at least initially, states would need maximum stocks â through their own procurement as well as from the Centre â to cater to their requirement. With more than 30 lakh vaccine doses given till 8 pm on Thursday, India has administered a total of more than 13.53 crore doses so far."
8,Kerala in talks with manufacturers for direct purchase of Covid-19 vaccines,"A queue at a school in Kottayam, Kerala, for Covid-19 vaccine on Tuesday, amid a shortage of doses in the state. (Express)

The Kerala government has initiated steps to directly purchase Covid-19 vaccines from manufacturers. A high-level committee headed by the chief secretary has been constituted for talks with the manufacturers, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday.

After the daily review of the Covid-19 situation in the state, the Chief Minister told the media that Kerala is not waiting for a final decision of the Union Government regarding the distribution of the vaccine (free of cost). “We have requested the Centre to provide the vaccine free of cost. We haven’t got any response from the Centre, but we are confident about a positive outcome. However, we can’t wait. If we wait until the Centre’s decision, it may be too late. Hence, the decision to go for direct purchase from the vaccine manufacturers,’’ he said.

Vijayan said whether it is the Centre or the state that ensures vaccine supply, what is most important is that people are vaccinated. The Centre can later reimburse the cost of the vaccine purchased by the state, he suggested.

He said the committee, also comprising health and finance secretaries, would hold discussions with the vaccine manufacturers about various aspects, including how many doses they can make available to the state.

On Thursday, Kerala reported 26995 new cases, the highest ever daily cases, taking the active caseload of the state to 1.56 lakh."
8,Pfizer offers vaccine to Indian govt at not-for-profit price,"US pharma major Pfizer said on Thursday that it had offered a not-for-profit price for its vaccine to the government and was in talks with the administration to deploy its jab for India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme.The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 mRNA vaccine has been widely used in the United States and Europe for inoculating large populations and has a tested efficacy of around 95%.It is a two-dose vaccine but the company said last week that people may need a third dose within 12 months of getting fully vaccinated, which may be the case with others too as scientists attempt to understand the duration of immunity.“For India, Pfizer has offered a not-for-profit price for its vaccine for the government immunisation program. We continue to be in discussions with the government and remain committed to make our vaccine available for deployment in India’s immunisation program,” a statement by the company read.The company said that it was interested in working exclusively with the government.“During the current pandemic situation worldwide, Pfizer has maintained that its priority would be to exclusively support governments through supply of its vaccine only to governments for their immunisation programs. This would be our approach in India as well,” the statement added.On April 13, India announced that Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, and would not need prior bridging trial results to seek emergency use authorization (EUA). The trials can be done in parallel to administering the shots to the general population..The move is expected to potentially boost India’s pandemic response when it has recorded the world’s worst surge in infections.At present, there are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson&Johnson. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Pfizer said it will continue talks with the Indian government on the matter.“We have noted the recent announcement with regard to the regulatory pathway for global vaccines. We remain committed to continuing our engagement with the government towards making the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine available for use in the government’s immunisation program in the country.”The company also denied some reports citing a price for American vaccines in India. “In all our agreements Pfizer has adopted a distinct pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries consistent with our commitment to work towards equitable and affordable access for our Covid-19 vaccine for people around the world,” the company said.Despite being the first company to have applied for EUA of its Covid-19 vaccine on December 7, Pfizer withdrew its application on February after the national drugs controller did not approve its EUA application and sought additional data.The decision was taken after the central drugs standard control organization (CDSCO) subject expert committee (SEC), on February 3, did not recommend granting approval for want of more data.The company said Pfizer’s priority had been to ensure rapid manufacturing and deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine to cater to the current emergency response scenario.“We are also mindful of the unique mRNA technology that is being utilized in this vaccine. Given these considerations, Pfizer has created two dedicated supply lines with established vaccine capabilities – one each in US and Europe… This will continue to be the company’s strategy for the time being. At this time we are not in discussions for any additional local manufacturing for this vaccine,” the company said.“Once the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will certainly evaluate all additional opportunities available. We remain committed to working towards equitable and affordable access for our COVID-19 vaccine for people around the world including in India, and we welcome opportunities to collaborate with the government to fight COVID-19,” the statement further read."
8,Sonia demands uniform price for Covid vaccines,"Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday questioning how the government could allow “brazen profiteering from people’s misery” as she demanded a re-evaluation of the Centre’s modified vaccination policy and a uniform price for vaccines.She referred to the Serum Institute of India (SII)’s Covishield rate list— 150 per vaccine dose for the Centre, but 400 for state governments and 600 for private hospitals. “This means that citizens will be compelled to pay these high rates to be vaccinated. This will also bleed the finances of state governments,” Gandhi said in her letter.The SII on Wednesday became the first company to disclose the pricing under the new, open-market mechanism for coronavirus vaccinations from next month.Gandhi questioned how the same vaccine manufactured by SII could have three different prices. She added there was no rationale or justification to this “arbitrary distinction”.“At a time when medical resources are scarce, hospital beds are unavailable, oxygen supply and availability of essential medicine is dwindling rapidly, why is your Government allowing a policy that reeks of such insensitivity,” she said.Gandhi accused the government of abdicating its responsibility of providing free vaccination to people in the age group of 18 to 45. “This is [a] complete abandonment of the Government’s responsibility towards our youth.” She reiterated the allocation to state governments should be “transparent and equitable, in line with the spirit of cooperative federalism”.The Centre on Monday announced all adults will be eligible for vaccination and doses can be sold in the market from May 1 as it heeded calls for wider access as India grapples with a surge of Covid-19 infections."

9,"Military, defence wings go in overdrive for Covid relief","As India reels under an unprecedented public health emergency, its hospitals stretched thin by a staggering number of Covid cases and deaths due to scarcity of beds, oxygen and medicines, the military and other wings of the defence ministry have been ordered to respond on war footing to fight the outbreak that has so far claimed nearly 185,000 lives, people familiar with the developments said on Thursday.From setting up Covid hospitals to ramping up oxygen production and airlifting of medical staff and oxygen containers to liaising with state governments to help them deal with the rising number of daily cases, the armed forces, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) are working overtime for Covid relief, said one of the people cited above.As many as 15,924,697 confirmed infections and 184,693 deaths (as of Wednesday) have been reported across the country since the pandemic began, according to HT’s dashboard. The most worrying factor right now is how fast daily cases are multiplying, and how the trajectory is showing no clear signs of approaching a peak.The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the second deadly wave of Covid that has ripped through the country. It has so far set up or is in the process of setting up state-of-the-art Covid hospitals in six cities to treat more than 3,100 critical patients, said a second official.The DRDO has set up a 500-bed hospital in Delhi and converted an ESIC hospital into a 500-bed Covid facility in Patna. In addition, hospitals with 450 beds in Lucknow, 750 beds in Varanasi and 900 beds in Ahmedabad are expected to be functional soon. A sixth Covid hospital is being readied in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur.The DRDO has also stepped in to address the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave of the disease. It has transferred oxygen generation technology to the industry, which has now started providing oxygen plants to state governments and hospitals, the official said. The Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, has ordered five such plants from Coimbatore-based Trident Pneumatics.The technology transferred to the industry is based on the onboard oxygen generation technology developed for the Tejas light combat aircraft. The oxygen generation plants can produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. “More plants can be supplied by the industry to cater to the hospital requirements pan-India,” the official said.The DPSUs are also making arrangements to buy oxygen plants for the production and supply of oxygen cylinders at a swift pace.Technology developed by the DRDO for a supplemental oxygen delivery system for soldiers posted in high-altitude areas has also been transferred to the industry, and it will soon be available in the market for use by Covid patients.The Indian Air Force has deployed its aircraft for airlifting medical personnel, oxygen containers, oxygen cylinders, trolleys and essential medicines, an IAF official said.“Doctors and nursing staff were airlifted from Kochi, Mumbai, Vizag and Bengaluru for setting up the DRDO Covid hospital at Delhi. Oxygen containers of the DRDO have also been airlifted from Bengaluru for Covid centres in Delhi,” he said.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services.“They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.On April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh carried out an extensive review of the preparedness of the armed forces and other allied organisations to deal with the surge in Covid infections across the country.At that meeting, Singh asked the DPSUs, the DRDO and others to work on war footing to provide oxygen cylinders and extra beds to civil administration and state governments. The armed forces and other stakeholders were also given the go-ahead to buy medicines and other critical items using their emergency powers.The military is also exploring the possibility of utilising the services of vaccinated retired military personnel to help the civil administration and state governments deal with the grim situation."
10,"Country is being run by God, remarks HC amid oxygen shortages","The Delhi high court on Thursday warned of criminal action against authorities failing to ensure “safe” and “unobstructed” passage of oxygen cylinders for hospitals in the city from different states, while regretting that “the country is being run by God”.“We direct the Centre to ensure strict compliance of the allocation order of April 21, April 22 of the ministry of home affairs under the Disaster Management Act and our order of April 21. We also direct all the authorities concerned who are bound by the order to ensure its strict compliance... We want to make it clear that this order is implemented immediately since non-compliance is likely to result in grave loss of lives and we put it to everyone that non-compliance of these orders will also invite criminal action”.“We direct the Centre to ensure that supplies of all the oxygen producing plants as per the allocation order are made and transportation takes place without any hindrance… to ensure that adequate security is provided to the lorries transporting oxygen and that there is no obstruction created. A special corridor may be created for immediate transportation,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli said.The bench, on Wednesday, in a late evening hearing, had got the Centre to assure it that safe and unobstructed passage would be provided to oxygen cylinders for patients in Delhi from different states. The Centre on Thursday issued an order with directions on timely and unhindered transportation of oxygen.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, for the Centre, told the court that the ministry of home affairs has issued an order to all the states and Union territories to ensure that no restriction shall be imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between states and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free interstate movement.The direction came after the Delhi government told the court that the amount of oxygen that was to come from Panipat in Haryana was not being allowed to be picked up by the local police there. The court was also informed that several hospitals in the city such as Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Rohini, Balaji Action Centre, Paschim Vihar, and many others had run out of oxygen supply and were left only with a few hours of medical oxygen.An anguished high court nudged the Centre and remarked during the hearing, “We all know that the country is being run by God,” adding that the situation in the city had become “precarious”. It said the Centre should make sure that oxygen reached the national capital without any hiccups.“If the government wants it can do anything and can even make heaven meet earth,” it observed.The directions were passed on a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra who sought ramping up of tests in the city. The petition, which was disposed of, was again revived by the HC on Monday, April 19, noting that the virus had raised its “ugly head” once again and that the “health care infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.The court noted that the Centre’s allocation of oxygen for Delhi from plants in other states such as Haryana was not being respected by the local administration there and it needed to be resolved immediately.With respect to the transportation by air, as suggested by the Delhi government, the court said oxygen cannot be airlifted as it would be hazardous and in case of an accident would not only affect the aircraft but also the population where it falls.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told the bench, “If there is any roadblock by any individuals or any officers, the officers have been instructed that if they are involved in any such activity they will be departmentally dealt with.”The bench, while dictating its order, said, “The position in Delhi has turned rather precarious with several hospitals reporting that either they have insufficient oxygen or it will not last for a longer period.”"
10,How hospitals scrambled for oxygen,"The Delhi government estimated the city will need around 700 MT of oxygen a day due to the increase in patients. On Wednesday, the Centre increased Delhi's oxygen quota to 480 MT."
11,"Ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply: Centre to states, UTs","The Centre on Thursday invoked the Disaster Management Act and directed the states and Union territories to ensure uninterrupted production and supply of medical oxygen and its transport along interstate borders, amid reports of several states stopping supply vehicles from travelling to other areas.The order, issued by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla, said the district magistrates, deputy superintendent of police and deputy commissioner of police of the district concerned will be personally liable in case there is any violation.Section 56 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which is in force since March 12 last year when the first wave of the coronavirus disease had begun in India, says that any officer refusing to or failing to implement the directions issued by the authority may face imprisonment of one year along with fine.Asserting that supply of medical oxygen cannot be limited to one state or district, the order said availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19 and with increasing cases, the medical oxygen supply will need to keep pace with the requirements of the states and Union territories.Bhalla directed there should be no restriction on the movement of medical oxygen between the states and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free interstate movement of vehicles carrying oxygen.He further instructed that no authority shall attach oxygen-carrying vehicles passing through any district for making supplies specific to any particular district. Subsequently, it asked states to make sure there are no restrictions imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the supplies only to hospitals of the respective state.“There shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into the cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without any restriction,” the order said.The Centre has already prohibited supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except those (nine specified industries) exempted by the government beginning Thursday.The order highlighted that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in its supplies has the potential to critically impact the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease in other parts of the country.The Centre announced on Wednesday evening that it was increasing the quota of oxygen in eight states, including Delhi, in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals."
11,"Oxygen shortage row: MHA invokes DM act, orders free inter-state movement of oxygen carrying vehicles","With reports of states hoarding on oxygen or stalling its supply to other states coming from across the country, the Centre Thursday issued orders under the Disaster Management Act that no state can hold up supplies of oxygen to another state.

Passing a series of instructions, the order issued by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla said: “no restriction shall be imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between the States and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state movement of oxygen carrying vehicles.”

It also made it clear that no restrictions could be imposed on “oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to the hospitals of the State/ UT in which they are located”.

“There shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into the cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without any restriction. No authority shall attach the oxygen carrying vehicles passing through the district or areas for making supplies specific to any particular district(s) or area. …States/UTs shall strictly abide by the supply plan of medical oxygen prepared by EG II (Empowered Group II) and as revised from time-to-time,” the order said;

It put the onus of implementing the order on district magistrates and senior superintendents of police and SPs saying they would be “personally liable” for its implementation.

Sources said while similar directions had been issued by the MHA through a letter to all chief secretaries on April 18, it was more advisory in nature. “This one is an order under the Disaster Management Act and failure to implement the order can attract penal provisions of the law for concerned state officials,” an MHA official said.

Under Section 51 of the DM Act, anyone refusing to comply with orders is liable for punishment with imprisonment up to one year, or fine, or both. In case this refusal leads to death of people, the person liable shall be punished with imprisonment up to two years.

The development comes at a time when reports from across the country suggest that many states are not allowing oxygen trucks to leave their states in the fear that it may lead to a shortage for their own hospitals. Many states have allegedly diverted oxygen meant for other states to their own hospitals, sources said.

In the past two days, Delhi has accused UP and Haryana of stalling its supply of oxygen, while Haryana has accused the Delhi government of “looting” its oxygen tanker meant for a hospital in Faridabad.

In its order, MHA has made it clear that states have to follow the supply plan made by the EG-II for the supply of oxygen to each state according to its requirement. It has said the plan has been made in consultation with the state governments and is revised from time to time based on requirements. It has also reiterated that industrial oxygen has already been diverted for medical purposes to meet the demand.

“…due to rapid rise in COVID-19 cases and with increasing case positivity rate, various States/UTs have imposed some additional restrictions on certain activities and weekend lockdowns/curfews etc… the availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of Medical Oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 and with the increasing cases, the medical oxygen supply will need to keep pace with the requirements of the States/ UTs,” the order has said reiterating that MHA has already issued orders that interstate movement of goods and people cannot be restricted in any situation.

“…medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in the supplies of Medical Oxygen in the country may critically impact the management of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease in other parts of the country,” the order has said."
11,PM urges states to act tough against hoarding of oxygen,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants states to come down heavily on hoarding of oxygen and fix responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction and told officials during a review meeting on Thursday to ensure “smooth, unhindered” supply to various states.The PM will attend three key meetings on Covid management and cancelled his election campaign in West Bengal scheduled for Friday.As patients and hospitals face acute shortage of oxygen, Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Thursday to review the situation across the country and discuss ways to boost availability. At 12.30pm on Friday, he will meet the country’s leading manufacturers of medical oxygen.Friday’s meeting will be the third meeting on oxygen in the month. On April 16, Modi met senior officials to review the status of oxygen supply.“Tomorrow, will be chairing high-level meetings to review the prevailing COVID-19 situation. Due to that, I would not be going to West Bengal,” the PM tweeted.Officials said that at 9am, the PM will review the Covid situation in an internal meeting, followed by a virtual interaction with chief ministers of high-burden states. His last meeting with the CMs was on April 8.Modi directed officials on Thursday to ensure that oxygen supply to various states happens in a smooth, unhindered manner.“He spoke about the need to fix responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction. He also asked ministries to explore various innovative ways to increase production and supply of oxygen,” an official release said.Various measures are being undertaken to rapidly increase the availability of cryogenic tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon tankers, import and airlifting of tankers as well as manufacturing them.The PM stressed on the need to ensure faster transportation of oxygen to the states. It was discussed that the railways is being used for rapid and non-stop long distance transport of tankers. The first rake has reached Vizag from Mumbai to transport 105MT. Similarly, empty oxygen tankers are also being airlifted to suppliers to reduce one-way journey time.Representatives from the medical fraternity spoke about the need for judicious use of oxygen and how an audit in some states decreased oxygen demand without affecting the condition of patients.Modi’s emphasis on faster transportation and the need to come down heavily on hoarders came after reports emerged that tankers were stopped at state borders and were unable to supply oxygen to Delhi.“The PM was informed that an elaborate exercise is being done in coordination with the states to identify their demand for oxygen and ensure adequate supply accordingly. The PM was briefed on how oxygen supply to states is steadily increasing. Against the present demand from 20 states of 6,785 MT/day of Liquid Medical Oxygen, Government of India has from 21st April, allocated 6,822 MT/day to these states,” the release said."

13,Cong leader AK Walia dies of Covid-19 at 72,"Senior Congress leader and former Delhi health minister Dr AK Walia died of Covid-19 on Thursday morning. The 72-year-old doctor-politician is credited for playing a crucial role in improving the health care and urban development infrastructure, especially in parts of east Delhi.Party members remember him as soft-spoken, humble, and always ready to help those in need. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi wrote to Walia’s brother, BK Ahluwalia, on the demise of veteran Congress leader. “His unwavering commitment to public service and contribution towards transforming Delhi will be remembered... his spirit of generosity, and willingness to go beyond his call of duty to help people in need will be missed,” wrote Gandhi in the letter, which was shared on a social networking site by Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary.A four-time MLA from Laxmi Nagar, and minister in all the three terms of the Sheila Dikshit government, Walia held multiple portfolios, including health, urban development, and power.Former Union minister Ajay Maken tweeted, “We lost Dr AK Walia last night. He was the architect of development in Trans Yamuna area of Delhi. As health minister he laid the foundation for series of govt hospitals in Delhi... his untimely death is a great loss for Delhi.”Senior Congress leader Haroon Yusuf said that Walia was invested in improving the government health infra.His own nursing home, Walia Nursing Home in east Delhi, is a landmark in health infrastructure in east Delhi, said two other Congress leaders."
13,Journalist dies month after road accident,"Renu Agal, a 54-year-old journalist, succumbed to head injuries at a private hospital in the national capital on Wednesday, nearly a month after the cycle-rickshaw she was in was rammed by an allegedly speeding car in north Delhi’s Civil Lines. This was the second death in the accident -- the cycle-rickshaw driver, whose identity remains unknown till date, died on April 1, over a week after the accident on March 25.According to the police, the Swift Dzire car that rammed the rickshaw was driven by Gaurav Batra, an assistant director with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).In the FIR, a police officer noted Batra “appeared” drunk. “We have collected his blood sample for testing and the report is awaited,” said another police officer when asked if Batra’s medical examination revealed excess alcohol in his blood.Agal, who worked at The Print, lived in West Delhi’s Mayapuri. On the evening of March 25, she was travelling on a cycle-rickshaw when the accident took place.Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north), said a case of rash and negligent driving and causing hurt was registered initially. “When the rickshaw rider succumbed to injuries, we added the IPC section pertaining to causing death due to negligence,” he said."
13,Madhya Pradesh: Woman kills self after 3 family members die of COVID-19,"A case has been registered in this regard and further investigations are underway, he added.

A woman allegedly committed suicide after three members of her family died of COVID-19 within a week’s time in Madhya Pradesh’s Dewas city.

The police, however, have not confirmed if the deaths of the three family members had occurred due to COVID-19 infection.

According to family sources, three members of Balkishan Garg’s family, including his wife Chandrakala (75), eldest son Sanjay (51) and youngest son Swapneesh (48), had died of the infection within days of each other.

After witnessing the three deaths in the span of five days, the family’s youngest daughter-in-law went into depression and allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself on Wednesday, they claimed.

On getting information about the suicide, the police reached the Garg residence and sent the woman’s body for post-mortem, Dewas city superintendent of police (CSP) Vivek Singh said.

A case has been registered in this regard and further investigations are underway, he added."
14,"Maharashtra: Tighter curbs on movement, quarantine for inter-district travel","Only authorised medical and government personnel will be able to board local trains, metro and mono trains, private transport such as taxi and auto-rickshaw will be allowed only in case of an emergency, and people travelling to other districts will have to undergo mandatory 14-day home quarantine as Maharashtra government further tightened restriction across the state in the wake of alarming surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases.

Even as it continued to shy away from the use of the word “lockdown” in official communication, the curbs, announced on Wednesday, were more stringent than any other restrictions put in place in recent past in the state.

The new set of restrictions will come into effect from 8pm on Thursday and will remain in force until 7am on May 1.

Under the new restrictions, inter-district travel by private transport will be restricted to emergency purposes only. While passengers will be allowed to travel on long-distance trains and buses, their hands will be stamped and they will be sent to a two-week home quarantine. Buses will ply with 50 per cent of their seating capacity.

In a bid to rein in fresh infections, the Maharashtra government first announced curbs on April 4 and kept on revising them with last order on April 20.

The government has also drastically reduced the attendance of staff at all government offices, including those governed by the centre, to 15 per cent or five personnel (whichever is higher) except for offices involved in emergency services directly connected to the management of the pandemic.

As per the new guidelines, local trains, metro and monorail will be accessible only to government employees (state, centre and local authorities) and medical personnel such as doctors, paramedics, lab technicians and medical clinic staff. Tickets or passes will be issued to them based on the identity cards of the government and of concerned medical organizations respectively. “Any person needing medical treatment or specially-abled persons along with one person accompanying the needy will be allowed to use local trains, metro and monorail,” said the order.

Private passenger transport such as taxi and auto-rickshaw, excluding buses, can ply only for emergency or essential services or other valid reasons with 50% of the seating capacity. “These are not expected to be inter-district or inter-city and should be confined to the city of residence of the travellers. Inter-district or inter-city travel is allowed only if required for performing an essential service or in case of medical emergencies or attending unavoidable events like funerals or severe sickness of family,” added the order.

For long-distance trains and inter-city and inter-district travelling by buses, the order said the local railway officers/Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) officers shall provide all information that local disaster management authority require for screening the passengers.

“At stoppages, where passengers are alighting, all passengers shall be stamped on hand for 14 days home quarantine. Thermal scanners shall be used and anyone with symptom shall be moved to corona care centres or to a hospital,” said the order.

“We don’t want people to walk around like last time. If they want to go to their native places, they can go but they will remain in home quarantine for 14 days mandatorily,” said an official.

The government has further left it to the local authorities to decide on the RAT (Rapid Antigen Test) of the passengers at the alighting point by appointing authorised labs. The cost of the test will be borne by the passengers. “We want to promote the RAT test, which is 50 per cent accurate but all the districts do not have the capacity to do it. So, they can take a call depending on the local situation,” said the official.

For weddings, the government said they may be conducted only as a single event in just one venue with the duration not extending beyond two hours and attendance beyond 25 persons. “With restrictions of 25 people, there were instances of people being invited in different batches throughout the day. So, we have restricted it to two hours in all and an overall attendance of 25 people,” said the official."

15,Night curfew hits street food vendors,"Bengaluru Bharat Kumar R, a street food vendor in Vijayanagar area of Bengaluru, is a worried man, like many others in the business. The extended night curfew and weekend restrictions announced by the government on Tuesday has dealt a harsh blow on the food cart vendor businesses, which were yet to recover from the last year’s lockdown in the city. “Our business starts only after 7-8 pm. We especially cater to those who come into town late after finishing work and want food, especially bachelors and others like delivery boys, cab, auto, and bus drivers among others. There is no section that does not come to us for food,” Kumar said. Food cart vendors, who serve dishes like egg rice, kebabs, tea and other condiments after dusk, said their businesses have come down by as much as 80%, adding that the new restrictions will further cripple their sole source of income. The BS Yediyurappa-led government, which announced fresh restrictions to contain the surging Covid-19 cases, has allowed food delivery from hotels and restaurants during the curfew hours, but has barely taken into consideration these vendors who feed the thriving gig economy of Bengaluru, said food experts. The government has tried to mitigate the hardships of those forced to stay back at home by allowing food and grocery delivery, fuel stations, cabs, buses and autos, medical stores, private security guards, ambulance and hospital staff among others. But the food carts, which offer a lifeline to workers in these sectors beyond regular hours, have neither got the permission to remain open nor received any financial compensation from the government this time or during the previous lockdown, they added. “Our business begins only after 8 pm. So, when the government order is for closure at 9 pm, we have to start closing by around 7.30 pm. Almost 80% of our business has vanished. Whether it is a night curfew or a lockdown or a weekend curfew, it has the same impact on us,” Manju G, another food vendor who has a stall outside the TTMC bus stand, said. The mobile food carts serve food for prices in the range of 30-60 in almost all urban centres of India, outside bus stands, railway stations, IT parks, among others. “A lot of delivery boys from Zomato, Swiggy and cab drivers from Ola and Uber eat from carts like ours,” Kumar added. This section of business is run mostly by families, with each member handling one aspect of the operations like cooking, cleaning, supplies and service. Food vendors are part of a large unorganised economy of Bengaluru and other large urban centres, but the lack of a union or organisation often deprives them of bargaining powers that other sectors may have, said experts. The government announced a slew of relief during the first lockdown for weavers, auto drivers, barbers and construction workers, but an even larger section of people in various professions do not even come in the radar of the administration, vendors and political leaders said. Being aware of the hardships people might endure if a second lockdown was announced, the Yediyurappa government tried to find a middle path with the night and weekend curfew to contain the Covid-19 surge without closure of businesses. “We have bigger problems than corona,” said Abdul Wahab, a food cart vendor in Frazer Town area in East Bengaluru. Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said the government has failed. “The government must first instill courage in people and aid them financially,” he said. Another Congress legislator said several sections of people were barely noticed during the previous lockdown and restrictions even this time. “The last lockdown was almost inevitable, and we did not have any knowledge or time. We used our savings to survive the lack of income. But this time we don’t know what to do to survive,” Syed Mudabbir Ahmed, an auto driver said. "
16,China says ready to help but India looks elsewhere for O2,"NEW DELHI: With India reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic, China said Thursday it stood ready to provide India with necessary support and assistance to get the situation under control.However, while India is looking to import oxygen from abroad as the union health ministry had said last week, official sources said China was not among the countries India was looking to source oxygen from. India for now has identified potential sources mainly in the Gulf and Singapore.Describing Covid-19 as a common enemy of all mankind that necessitated international solidarity and mutual assistance, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday Beijing had taken note of the recent ""grave situation in India with a temporary shortage of anti-epidemic medical supplies"".India had sourced medical equipment from China last year but mainly through commercial agreements. Both India and China have supplied Covid-19 vaccines to south Asian countries even though countries like Sri Lanka and Nepal started to accept Chinese vaccines only after supplies from India dried up. Faced with a grim domestic situation, India is no longer allowing vaccine export as it was earlier, even though it hasn't officially banned it.China was Thursday reported to have convened another meeting with countries in the region including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for a coordinated response to the pandemic. Apart from these 3 countries, the Maldives has also asked the Indian government to ensure that the Serum Institute of India honours the commercial agreements signed with them for the Covishield vaccine.In the case of Bangladesh, Dhaka had signed a contract for 30 million doses of the vaccine but, according to the Bangladesh media, Serum has supplied only 7 million doses since January.India ambassador to Bangladesh Vikram Doraiswami assured Dhaka Thursday that India was working on increasing the availability and supply of vaccines.Bangladesh too said Thursday that while it was making efforts to procure the remaining vaccines in accordance with the agreement signed with Serum, it was also making an effort to procure vaccines from China and Russia under a commercial agreement or joint production. ""Bangladeshâs diplomatic missions in China and Russia are in communication with the governments of those countries as well as the vaccine manufacturing companies there,"" said Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud bin Momen."
16,"With O2 running out, Delhi-NCR hosps asking patients to leave","NEW DELHI: Hospitals in Delhi-NCR had to issue appeals all through Thursday for their oxygen stock to be replenished with the lives of their Covid patients hanging in the balance. Top private hospitals like Apollo , Fortis, Max and Ganga Ram issued open appeals to the authorities to ensure timely delivery of the critical supply, citing the number of Covid patients who were dependent on it for their survival.However, smaller hospitals â with lesser influence but equally worried about the Covid patients in their care â were jittery and reaching a breaking point. Some of them began asking their patients to look for beds in other hospitals while stopping new admissions.""We are supposed to give life. If we cannot give even oxygen, our patients will die,"" said Sunil Kumar Saggar , CEO of Shanti Mukand Hospital in Karkardooma, in a choked voice around 2.43pm on Thursday with his hospital left with just two hours of oxygen. He was anxious about the 110 Covid patients in their care.The crisis had started brewing at this 200-bed hospital around 3am. Out of the 110 Covid patients, 12 were on ventilator with one consuming 18 litres of oxygen per minute. Saggar, along with a couple of doctors, reviewed the situation and hoped to survive for some more hours, relying on the 1.7 metric tonnes of oxygen received from their vendor a day earlier. By 5am, more doctors had arrived. However, as the day progressed, the hospital realised it would soon run out of oxygen.The management reached out to ministers and several other people but to no avail. They then put new admissions on hold and started telling their patients to either arrange for a cylinder or shift them out. Even as Saggarâs video went viral, panic was setting in among the patients. ""We discharged five of them but told them we were trying to arrange supplies and if they felt unwell, they could come back later. Two other patients refused to leave and said they would wait and watch. The oxygen tanker finally arrived at 7.20pm. We had one patient who had crashed but we managed to save him. The supply we have received will keep us going for another 20 hours,"" said Saggar. He added that Delhi Police provided a green corridor for the tanker.Meanwhile, in Najafgarh, Rathi Hospital, which had 65 Covid patients, was also nervously watching its oxygen stock getting depleted. While Delhi Police officials had managed to arrange some for them on Wednesday, it wasnât enough. On Thursday morning, around 8am, the hospital sent out an SOS , asking for help. They also put out a tweet informing people that they would soon run out of oxygen.Speaking to TOI, hospital owner Dr Ankur Rathi, said: ""Almost 60-70% of our patients needed oxygen. We first thought we would start telling our patients to leave but realised there were no ambulances available and no oxygen cylinders to go with them. We realised it was a helpless situation either way, so we put out a tweet.""The hospital spoke to the cops. ""It was a team effort and even our patients started looking out for vendors. By evening, we somehow managed to sail through but this is going to last only for seven to eight hours,"" said Rathi, indicating how nerve-wracking the entire exercise had become.Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar, which was taking care of 100 Covid patients, started shifting them out around 9.18pm after it ran out of oxygen. Dr Kousar A Shah, chief operating officer of Akash Hospital in Dwarka, said they have 233 Covid patients, of whom 75% were able to breath only because of oxygen support. ""We have only an hour of oxygen left. All my officials are running around begging for oxygen cylinders so that patients donât suffer,"" he said in an appeal to the government on Thursday afternoon.After being asked to look for admission elsewhere by Ishan Hospital in Rohini, family members of a patient summed up their predicament. ""It is like leaving a patient to die. There are no beds available anywhere else. We managed to get one here after pleading with the doctors and running around for four days. We cannot go anywhere and we canât be here either knowing that the oxygen supply is limited.""""A patient who is on ventilator support will die within minutes if oxygen supply stops. Someone who is on high-flow oxygen may pull through for a while longer but not much. That is why there can be no delay due to any reason in the supply of oxygen,"" said Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family Hospital in south Delhi. The hospital has more than 380 Covid patients on oxygen support.""The situation is unprecedented and horrific. At one of our hospitals, the critical care specialists had to reduce the amount of oxygen being given to patients while they waited for the supply. There was no other way to keep the system running, but at the same time it posed a serious threat to the life of the patients. Our nurses and doctors are crying seeing the patients struggle to breathe due to a problem that can be easily solved through proper coordination,"" said an anguished doctor, who did not wish to be identified, at a top private hospital.Meanwhile, in Ghaziabad, Shanti Gopal Hospital in Indirapuram and Chandra Lakshmi Hospital in Vaishali were getting ready to discharge patients.At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, doctors said, as of 8pm on Thursday, they had only five hours of oxygen left. ""At present, 510 Covid patients are admitted and 142 of them are on high-flow oxygen support. If we donât get timely replenishment of oxygen, there will be mayhem,"" said an official. Similarly, Batra Hospital in south Delhi had only two hours of oxygen left."
17,Haryana imposes fresh curbs: All shops to shut by 6 pm from today; ban on non-essential gatherings,"West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana announced lockdowns, despite the Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) directives to desist from imposition of these lockdowns and seek its clearance. (File)

IN AN attempt to curtain the rapid transmission rate of Covid-19 across the state, the Haryana government imposed fresh curbs on Thursday, and ordered that all shops would shut down by 6 pm hours from Friday (April 23) onwards, till further orders.

The shops will be allowed to open daily. The state government also banned all non-essential gatherings and made permission from the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) mandatory for holding any function.

The curbs were first announced by state’s Health-cum-Home Minister Anil Vij who tweeted: “All shops will remain closed from 6 pm onward in Haryana from tomorrow, all non-essential gatherings are banned, anybody holding any function within prescribed limit will have to seek permission from concerned SDM.”

Later in the day, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar too announced: “As a precautionary measure, the state government has decided to close shops dealing in non-essential items in crowded markets from 6 pm from April 23 onwards.”

A detailed order clarifying which shops would be shut down and for how long was yet to be issued by the state’s revenue and disaster management department at the time of filing this report.

Vij told The Indian Express, “The shops can open daily, but will have to be shut by 6 pm daily. This step has been taken to avoid crowding in marketplaces during evening hours.”

Vij reiterated that the state government “was not thinking if imposing lockdown at this stage” and added that their priority is to first “strictly implement the existing measures that we are taking to curtail transmission”.

With several states embroiled in a slugfest over the medicinal oxygen quota, Khattar, Thursday, said, “Adequate arrangements have been made in the state to ensure uninterrupted supply of medicines, oxygen and other facilities to the patients suffering from Covid-19 infection.”

In a statement issued after chairing the Cabinet meeting, the CM also clarified queries regarding shortage of oxygen supply in state’s hospitals: “Though some difficulty was reported in the supply of oxygen to Haryana, Delhi and other states from Panipat plant, the problem has been resolved. I have held a detailed discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue.”

“A roster has now been made for filling of oxygen cylinders and loading these cylinders onto trucks from Panipat oxygen plant. From now on, one truck will be loaded for Haryana and one truck each for Delhi and Punjab. This entire process at Panipat plant is being closely monitored by me,” he added.

“A total of 170 metric tonnes of oxygen was supplied to Delhi from 10 pm to 6 am today from the Panipat plant. Furthermore, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had also received a call and expressed satisfaction for the supply of oxygen from the plant. The Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT of oxygen per day, out of which 140 MT is supplied to Delhi, 80 MT is supplied to Haryana and about 20 MT is for Punjab. Haryana is also supplied 20 MT from Bhiwadi plant in Rajasthan. However, yesterday there was some problem in the supply. Today, I shall talk to the Rajasthan CM,” Khattar said.

Responding to a question regarding the current status of availability of beds with ventilators for Covid patients in hospitals across the state, Khattar said, “The facility of beds has been made online in Gurugram and Faridabad districts. Besides this, around 500 beds have been arranged at SGT Medical College, Gurugram, 150 beds are being arranged in the industrial area and 50 more beds have been arranged, today. Indian Army has also taken the initiative of helping the state. DRDO is making arrangement of 500 beds each in Panipat and Hisar for Covid patients. Apart from this, talks are also being held with the Army Commander, Western Command, Chandimandir and efforts are being made to ensure availability of doctors and other facilities by the Army.”

Responding to a news item printed in an English daily regarding wasting of vaccine doses, Khattar said, “The news is baseless. In Haryana, wastage of Covid vaccine is only 1.5 per cent, which is within the prescribed limit. Once a dose is opened for vaccination, only 20-40 injections are utilised. Sometimes because of difference in number of doses opened and administered also becomes a reason for wastage.”

Responding to a question regarding blackmarketing of Remedesivir injection, Khattar said, “1000 Remedesivir injections were supplied in government hospitals till yesterday and the supply will be further increased in government hospitals. However, private hospitals are making arrangement for this injection at their own levels. There is a need to create awareness in society. Even in an pandemic-like situation, if someone is doing blackmarketing, strict action will be taken against those involved in this crime.”

Talking about the rates fixed for ventilator-beds in private hospitals, Khattar said, “As per the infrastructure facilities offered in private hospitals, the charges of ventilator beds are fixed from Rs 8000 to Rs 18,000. If a hospital charges more than this, strict action will be taken against it, provided any complaint in this regard is received.”

Khattar reiterated that there would be no lockdown in Haryana and industrial units would be allowed to function. “This time because of the ongoing pandemic, no industrial unit would be shut down. However, industries which are running their operations in congested areas will be asked to follow the prescribed Covid protocols while carrying out their operations.”

He added, “Covid guidelines have been issued for wedding ceremonies and other social programmes. As per the guidelines, a gathering of upto 50 people is allowed inside a marriage palace, while in outdoor venues, the gathering limit should be only 200 persons. Similarly, a gathering of only 20 persons is allowed for cremation.”

On April 21, the state had recorded its biggest single-day spike both in terms of new infections and fatalities by reporting 9,623 new infections and 45 deaths.

The state government Thursday also changed its academic calendar and announced summer vacations in all government and private schools till May 31.

“In view of the prevailing conditions due to pandemic, the state government has decided to change the academic calendar of the session 2021-22. Accordingly, summer vacations in all the government as well as private schools have been declared w.e.f. April 22 to May 31,” an order issued by Dr J Ganesan, special secretary (school education department) read."
18,"PM Modi chairs high-level meet on oxygen supply, availability","The officials briefed PM Modi on the efforts undertaken in the last few weeks to improve the supply of oxygen.

Chairing a high-level meeting to review oxygen supply across the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked top officials to work rapidly on increasing its production, boosting the speed of distribution and using innovative ways to provide oxygen support to health facilities.

PM also said that states must act against any hoarding of oxygen and directed officials to ensure that the oxygen supply to various states happens in a smooth, unhindered manner and called for fixing responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction.

In the meeting that also discussed ways and means to boost oxygen availability amid demands from many states for an increase in its supply, Modi was told that the supply of life-saving gas to states has been steadily increasing.

Against the present demand from 20 states of 6,785 MT/day of liquid medical oxygen, the Centre has from April 21 allocated 6,822 MT/day to these states, a statement said.

It was noted that in the last few days, the availability of liquid medical oxygen has been increased by about 3,300 MT/day with contributions from private and public steel plants, industries, oxygen manufacturers as well as through prohibition of supply of oxygen for non-essential industries.

Modi said states should come down heavily on hoarding and stressed the need to ensure faster transportation of oxygen.

The statement said railways is being used for rapid and non-stop long-distance transport of tankers.

The first rake has reached from Mumbai to Vizag to transport 105 MT of the liquid medical oxygen. Similarly, empty oxygen tankers are also being air-lifted to oxygen suppliers to reduce one-way journey time in oxygen supply.

The prime minister was informed that an elaborate exercise is being done in coordination with states to find their demand for oxygen and ensure adequate supply accordingly, the statement said.

Top officials representing various ministries informed Modi that they are working together with the states to operationalize the sanctioned PSA oxygen plants as soon as possible.

“PM directed the officials to ensure that oxygen supply to various states happens in a smooth, unhindered manner. He spoke about the need to fix responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction. He also asked ministries to explore various innovative ways to increase production & supply of oxygen,” it said.

Various measures are being undertaken to rapidly increase the availability of cryogenic tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon tankers, import and airlifting of tankers as well as manufacturing them, it added.

Representatives from the medical community also spoke about the need for judicious use of oxygen and how an audit in some states has decreased oxygen demand without affecting the condition of patients.

The meeting was attended by the Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to PM, Home Secretary, Health Secretary and officials from the Ministry of Commerce & Industry, Ministry of Road Transport, Pharmaceuticals and NITI Aayog."
18,"Tamil Nadu govt assures high court on the availability of oxygen, ventilators","The Tamil Nadu government Thursday informed the Madras High court that it has enough supply of oxygen and ventilators. The state government’s reply comes after the Madras High Court took suo motu notice of newspaper reports on the shortage of Remdesivir and ventilators in the state and diversion of oxygen from a city plant to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

The bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed Vijay Narayanan, the advocate general for Tamil Nadu, to get clear instructions from the government to ensure that the state his handling the issue properly.

In the second half of the day, AG Vijay Narayanan informed the court that Tamil Nadu is one of the very few states with no shortage of ventilators at a time of dire need and the manufacturing is far ahead of requirement. He further added that there are about 9,600 ventilators of which 5,887 are earmarked for Covid-19 treatment and in private there about 6000 ventilators and 3,000 of them have been earmarked for the treatment of the deadly viral.

The court said if the state has sufficient resources, it should also be helping other states as well. The court further added that it will post the matter for further hearing on Monday when the state is expected to produce more details on beds and vaccine availability.

Tamil Nadu government asserted that it has adequate stock of oxygen but would take up with the Centre the issue of diversion of about 45 metric tonnes of medical oxygen to neighbouring states.

Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan said the state had been providing oxygen to its neighbouring states which are running a deficit of medical oxygen. However, he said the diversion initiated by the Centre should not create any trouble in the state in future and hence, they would take up the issue with the Centre to ensure that the situation is comfortable for them in the future as well.

While rejecting the claim that some deaths at the Vellore hospital took place due to the lack of oxygen supply, Tamil Nadu Health Minister C Vijayabaskar reaffirmed that the state has enough oxygen and vaccine supply and there is no need to panic. “The liquid medical oxygen manufacturing capacity is around 400 metric tonnes a day in Tamil Nadu and the daily medical consumption of oxygen is around 240 tonnes per day. We have a strong healthcare base here in Tamil Nadu. The state has a storage capacity of around 1,200 tonnes,” he told reporters Wednesday.

He also added that there won’t be much wastage of vaccines from May 1 as the Centre has allowed everyone above 18 years to get vaccinated. “Unlike states like Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat which are reporting high Covid-19 cases and have an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders, Tamil Nadu is well equipped with oxygen supply. There are 32,405 oxygen beds in Tamil Nadu and 6,504 oxygen beds in Chennai. There are 54,342 beds in Tamil Nadu to even deal with severe cases,” he added.

However, patients in some of the districts with high Covid cases raised complaints about lack of beds. For instance, in Chengalpet district, which had been reporting the second most number of cases in Tamil Nadu after Chennai, there was a shortage of beds for patients. Some patients were made to wait inside the ambulance near the hospital for hours with oxygen support. Close to 75 of the oxygen beds in these districts (including private hospitals) are occupied.

Some of the private hospitals with medium facilities are anticipating a scarcity of oxygen. As per the data provided by the government on the availability of beds in private hospitals, the admission request is double the times the available beds. For instance, a private hospital with 34 bed facilities is having 72 patients in queue. The patients are made to wait for long hours for their turn. Beds allocated for Covid-19 and suspected cases, oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds were all occupied.

A senior doctor from the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association said the state has enough supply of beds and panic was caused by some of the patients, who wanted to get admitted to the hospital despite having mild symptoms.

“We have not reached the ‘deficit’ stage here in Tamil Nadu. Oxygen-supported beds are available in government hospitals. The state is planning to increase the facility as well. The anxiety of some of the patients causes much trouble to some of them in serious need. Those with lower oxygen levels and comorbidities are not getting admission. This forces the private hospitals to push the severe cases to government hospitals at the last moment which creates unnecessary tension and stress for doctors. Maybe the government can bring more awareness by displaying the availability of beds in a public domain and admit people on the basis of severity. Mild cases can be handled at home. People staying in health care centres should stay there. If this could be ensured, there will be less load of patients in hospitals. A possible tie-up between government and private hospitals will also curb the spread of the pandemic,” he said.

Meanwhile, the opposition DMK and AMMK slammed the diversion of oxygen by the Centre. DMK president MK Stalin said the Centre should have checked the situation in Tamil Nadu with the government and charged it with not taking the states seriously. AMMK founder TTV Dhinakaran said the Centre’s decision to divert the oxygen from Tamil Nadu without consulting the state administration is not acceptable.

20,'National emergency': SC calls crisis triggered by 2nd Covid-19 wave,"The Supreme Court on Thursday called the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave a “national emergency” as it initiated a public interest litigation on its own, and asked the Centre to present before it on Friday a national plan to combat the crisis that has now made India the worst hot spot of the entire “The situation in various parts of the country is grim. There seems to be a sudden surge in the number of Covid patients and mortality,” said the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, while taking a suo motu cognisance of the surge in infections, which have led to a shortage of hospital beds and crucial supplies such as medical oxygen and medicines.The order said its focus areas at this time were the supply of medical oxygen, essential medicines, the method and manner of vaccination, and the declaration of lockdowns to check the spread of the disease.Issuing the notices to the Union and state governments, it asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to remain present in the court with the national plan on availability and distribution of essential supplies and services. The bench, which also includes justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as amicus curiae to assist the court.A day after India saw the world’s biggest one-day jump in the country again broke all records as 332,394 new infections and 2,255 deaths were reported on Thursday, both new single-day records.The ferocious second wave of infections has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums across the country and has led to frantic cries for help on social media as patients throughout the country struggled to arrange for beds, key medical supplies such as oxygen and medicines.Pointing out that at least six high courts were hearing issues related to the preparedness of the states and the Centre to deal with the crisis, the bench also issued notices to the petitioners before the high courts, asking why uniform orders should not be passed by the Supreme Court.“The high courts have passed certain orders which may have the effect of accelerating and prioritising the services to a certain set of people and slowing down the availability of these resources to certain other groups whether the groups are local, regional or otherwise,” recorded the court in its order, while telling Mehta that these orders were also creating confusion and diversion of resources because of different priorities.“Prima facie, we are inclined to take the view that the distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of the health authorities which undoubtedly take into account relevant factors like severity, susceptibility, the number of people affected and the local availability of resources,” the court recorded in its four-page order.On the issue of lockdowns, the CJI, whose bench had on Tuesday stayed an order of the Allahabad high court for virtually locking down five worst-hit districts of Uttar Pradesh, observed that this authority should be with the state government. “We want to keep the power to declare lockdown with states. It cannot be a judicial decision,” he remarked.In its order, the apex court also asked the Union government to apprise it of existence or requirement of a coordinating body that could consider allocation of the resources in a consultative manner with the involvement of concerned states and Union territories in addition to providing logistical support for transportation and distribution of essential medicines, oxygen and other resources.The bench further asked the Centre to consider the declaration of essential medicines and medical equipment required for treatment of Covid-19 as “essential commodities” under the law.When Mehta asked if the Centre was still required to make submissions before the high courts after the top court’s cognisance, justice Bhat said that the central government should go ahead and adduce its national plan before high courts since the idea was not to supersede high court orders at this moment. However, the CJI was of the opinion that it was perhaps a better idea for the Supreme Court to hear everything together and the matters before the high courts could be transferred to it.During the hearing, the bench had observed that it will issue a notice only to the Centre at the moment. But the written order released in the evening mentioned notices to all the states as well as the petitioners before the high courts.Experts questioned this move.Senior counsel and former additional solicitor general Indira Jaising, however, questioned why justice Bobde put the matter before himself on Friday when he knew that he will not be able to deal with it after one hearing because he is demitting office.“No one had complained about any high court order. So who was the aggrieved party? Can high court orders be bypassed without being challenged? If the Delhi high court had not stepped in at a late-night hearing on Wednesday, many more lives would have been lost,” she told HT, referring to the high court’s order on a Max hospital plea urgently seeking medical oxygen.Former attorney general and senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi also termed the suo motu registration of the case as “ill-conceived”.“In Covid times, the apex court is hardly functioning when you have just two-three benches sitting there off late. On the other hand, high courts have been doing a great job. They should not be stultified. Proactive high court benches across the nation should rather get a pat on their back for holding courts at all times and rising to the occasion. In any case, this issue should have been left to the new CJI who takes over on Saturday, just a day later.”Salve, who was present in the court on behalf of Vedanta with a request for reopening its Sterlite Copper plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi to produce and supply oxygen for Covid-19 patients, said people were dying every day. “We want this permission only for starting the oxygen plant. And we will supply it free of cost. Give us the permission today and we can start producing it in 5-6 days.”The plant was shut down in May 2018 after 13 civilians were shot dead in the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant, citing environmental concerns. The Supreme Court has also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run.Salve said Vedanta was pleading only for making the oxygen plant in Thoothukudi functional so that it could provide thousands of tonnes of oxygen for medical purposes.Mehta cited the dire need for medical oxygen and added that the Centre was augmenting its supply from all possible sources. “Let Vedanta operate its plant only for the purpose of producing oxygen and this will be diverted only for medical purposes. Sooner the plant starts functioning, better for the country.”Senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who represented the Tamil Nadu government, said there was a “trust deficit” with Vedanta. He added the violations for which the plant was shut could not be ignored. The state government opposed any urgent hearing of Vedanta’s application.Justice Bobde questioned the Tamil Nadu government’s attitude. “What is this attitude? You are not manufacturing it [oxygen] and you will be getting it free of cost for your medical emergencies. We will make sure they follow all environmental norms, but we do not appreciate your attitude. This is a national emergency. Do not throw spokes like this,” the CJI told Vaidyanathan, while fixing the hearing into the matter on Friday.Mehta said between protecting human life and the environment, they must lean toward protecting human lives."
20,Covid: How did situation get so bad during 2nd wave,"But how did things get so bad?

Infectious variants

But will cases continue to climb?

What's next?

(With inputs from PTI, AP)

NEW DELHI: India on Thursday shattered the global record of most Covid infections in a single day after registering a massive spike of nearly 3.15 lakh fresh cases along with 2,102 deaths in the past 24 hours.The deluge of infections has led to a severe health crisis in the country with PM Modi saying recently that the second wave has hit India ""like a storm"".What has been particularly worrying during the ongoing Covid surge is the rapid pace at which India is adding new infections.It has taken just 17 days for the daily case count to rise from 1 lakh on April 4 to over 3 lakh on Wednesday. During this period, cases have surged at 6.76% daily, more than four times faster than a similar growth in daily numbers in the US â the only other country that has recorded more than 1 lakh cases in a day.After the first peak in September, cases dipped for 30 straight weeks before they started rising again in mid-February.Experts and authorities believe that the overwhelming surge happened because people let their guard down and were lulled into believing that the worst of the pandemic was behind them.They add that India also failed to seize the opportunity to augment its healthcare infrastructure and vaccinate aggressively.""We were so close to success,"" Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking India's pandemic, told AP.Virologist Shahid Jameel said that people let their guard down too early and opened up.""We really didn't prepare in the time we got. As a result, the healthcare system is severely short-staffed right now ... the infrastructure is crumbling.""Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at an Australian university, said that people started to think they have escaped the pandemic, especially when it didn't hit the country as hard as everyone was expecting during the first wave.""Now, of course, we are seeing a much more significant problem emerging, and you know, it could prove disastrous. You can't even vaccinate 1.2 billion overnight, it's just not possible even with all the best resources,"" he said.Professor Rijo M John from the Kerala-based Rajagiri College of social sciences said that the political leaders also share the blame due to their ""irresponsible statements"".""Once the cases from the first wave began dropping and reached a low, there had been an overwhelming feeling among the general public that the worst was behind and they were out of danger. It was partly fuelled by irresponsible statements from several political leaders, many from the ruling government itself, leading people to inadvertently believe that India had defeated Covid. Perhaps, this may have lead them to engage in laxer behaviour,"" he said.Critics have also pointed to the government deciding not to pause religious festivals or elections despite the initial spike in infections, which may have exacerbated the surge.""Authorities across India, without exception, put public health priorities on the back burner,"" said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.Meanwhile, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan refused to speculate why authorities could have been better prepared, saying: ""Today is not the time to go into why did we miss, or did we miss, did we prepare?""Some experts said it is likely that the surge could be fueled by the presence of more infectious variants, which weren't there during the first wave.Late last year, scientists had detected a new variant, called B.1.617, with two mutations - the E484Q and L452R. This double mutant strain was first detected in Maharashtra.""We cannot rule out the role of more infectious variants (homegrown and known imported variants) in different parts of the country. In most samples in Punjab, the UK variant is isolated, while the available evidence indicates the 'double mutant' strain is mostly prevalent in the state of Maharashtra. While it is known that the UK variant is more contagious, evidence regarding the Indian strain is yet to emerge,"" professor Giridhar Babu of Public Health Foundation of India said.Now, India has also detected a ""triple mutated"" variant of the virus, which has been found in samples collected from Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.In fact, the Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618).âBengal strainâ, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and â something that experts find particularly worrying â may be capable of escaping a personâs immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated.There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears over the new variants.It's hard to say but experts believe that India will hit its peak between May 11-15.Scientists working on a mathematical model to work out the course of the pandemic say there is a possibility of a peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total âactiveâ infections.This means the number of âactiveâ cases in India will keep increasing roughly for another three weeks before a decline.If the current model shows the trend correctly, the mid-May peak would be three time higher than the first peak of over 10 lakh âactiveâ cases witnessed on September 17 last year.The current model shows that Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana may see a peak of 'new' cases during April 25-30; Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal during May 1-5 while Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh during May 6-10. It shows Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh might already have reached its peak phase now while Bihar will see it around April 25.India is faced with the massive challenge of trying to prevent its health care system from further collapse until enough people can be vaccinated to significantly reduce the flow of patients.The flood of new infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system, with various hospitals as well as states reporting shortage of oxygen, ICU beds, ventilators and key drugs.The good news is that India is a major vaccine producer, but even after halting large exports of vaccines in March to divert them to domestic use, there are still questions of whether manufactures can produce enough fast enough.""Vaccination is one way to slow down the spread - but this really depends on the speed and availability of the shots,"" said Reddy of the Public Health Foundation.India has so far administered jabs to over 13.23 crore of its population, which includes over 1.9 crore people who have been fully vaccinated."
21,Kerala: Saritha Nair held in solar scam case,"Saritha Nair, the prime accused in the solar panel scam that rocked Kerala during the previous Congress-led UDF rule, was arrested on Thursday in connection with the case.

Nair was picked up by the police from her residence here after a court in Kozhikode had issued a warrant against the controversial businesswoman for failing to appear before it in a case filed against her in connection with scam.

She was brought to Kozhikode and remanded, police said.

According to a complaint filed by Kozhikode native Abdul Majeed with the police in 2012, the two accused — Nair and Biju Radhakrishnan had taken Rs 42.70 lakhs from him for providing franchise in their company besides installing solar panels in his office and house.

But, neither was the contract executed nor the money refunded, the complainant stated.

The trial court was to deliver the judgement in February but since the accused did not turn up, the pronouncement had to be postponed.

Biju Radhakrishanan and Saritha Nair are the first and second accused respectively in the case, the trial of which began on January 25, 2018.

Saritha S Nair and her accomplice Biju Radhakrishnan had swindled many people of crores of rupees promising to install solar panels and offering franchise and jobs in their company, Team Solar Renewable Energy Solutions Company."
22,Cost of vaccinating the 18-44 population,"On April 19, the Union government announced that vaccinations will open for everyone above the age of 18. While the Centre is providing free vaccination to those about 45, it indicated that people in the will either have to get them from state governments or buy them from private hospitals. This means that unless state governments decide to supply the vaccines free of cost, people will have to pay to get them. So far, seven state governments have declared that they will provide free vaccines. To be sure, the Centre will continue to acquire vaccines, which may be used to vaccinate the 45-plus population or to supply to state governments.More clarity is needed on the procurement process and other important details. But answering this question requires clarity on the cost of vaccines. So far, only one of the vaccine manufacturers, Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine () has declared its price – 400 per dose for state governments and 600 per dose for supply to private hospitals. Other vaccines, which include Covaxin made by Bharat Biotech, and those that will be imported or their Indian-made versions will be rolled out, could change the price in the days to come. Taking the SII price as the benchmark for now, vaccination people between 18 and 44 years of age could range anywhere between 47,500 crore to 71,500 crore, depending on whether the SII vaccine is procured at ?400 per dose or ?600 dose. Where does this number come from? The total population of 18-44-year-old age-group in India is expected to be 594.6 million, according to the report of the government’s Technical Group on Population Projections. This report also gives the statewise break-up of the 18-44 population. This number, when multiplied by ?800 or 1200 (for two doses of Covidshield) gives the total cost of 47,566 crore or 7,1349 crore. Uttar Pradesh, the state with the largest population of 18-44 year olds will have to spend between 7,970 crore to 11,960 crore for vaccinations. For smaller states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand this number will be in the range of 400- 625 crore respectively.The absolute cost of vaccination, while it is important, does not tell us about the fiscal burden on the states. In order to calculate this, it is useful to look at the vaccine cost (at 800 for two doses) as a share of the total spending of states. An HT analysis shows that the fiscal burden of vaccination, defined as cost of vaccination as a share of total budgeted spending of states, will vary in a big way across states. Among 21 states for which data is available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy’s (CMIE) database and population projection report, Bihar will face the highest burden – 1.8% of total state spending in 2021-22. This number is the lowest in Himachal Pradesh, where the burden will be just 0.54% of the budgeted state spending. All state budget numbers are 2021-22 budget estimates except for Punjab and Andhra Pradesh where 2020-21 numbers have been used. The total cost of  assuming everybody in the 18-44 age-groups was to use the state government supply would be 47,565.8 crore, or 26% of the total health spending of the states in 2020-21 as per CMIE data.To be sure, the net cost per person for different governments will likely be lower than these estimates because some people might take the private route for vaccinating themselves and it is possible that some state governments ask some sections of the population to foot the bill for vaccination in part or full.Since India does not release income data for its workers, the best way to answer this question is to use earnings estimates given in the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data. These are 2018-19 figures, but HT has not adjusted them for inflation, given the uncertainty about the adverse impact of the pandemic on employment and earnings. According to PLFS, there were 356 million workers in India in 2018-19 in the current weekly status, or the status of employment during the week preceding the survey. Wage data is available only for this status. PLFS classifies workers into four categories: regular wage/salaried, self-employed, casual workers, and casual workers employed in public works such as MGNREGS. Among these four, regular wage salaried workers had the highest incomes, while the casual workers engaged in public works (about 1% of workers) had the lowest incomes. 22% of Indian workers are casual workers other than public works, who earn an average of 8,340 per month.It is to be expected that an earning member in a household might have to buy vaccines for more than one person in the household, as every member in the 18-44 year age-group might not be employed. According to PLFS, the work force participation rate in the 18-44 year age-group was 51.6% in 2018-19. This means that 48.4% of the population in this age-group is not working. An HT analysis of unit level PLFS data can help in finding out the actual burden of vaccinating people in the 18-44 year age-group by calculating the number of 18-44 year olds in that household and total household earnings irrespective of the age of the earning member. This exercise shows that an average Indian household will end up spending 24% of its monthly incomes on vaccinating its 18-44 members if it was to spend 1,200 for both doses. This headline number varies greatly across income class and states. For the bottom 20% of households, this burden will be 43% of their monthly incomes. For the top 20%, this number will be 12% of the household monthly income. The financial burden, as is to be expected, will be significantly higher in rural areas (31%) compared to urban areas (16%).As in the case of the fiscal burden, the private cost of vaccinations will also burden households differently across states. Replicating the analysis used above at the state level, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, and Jharkhand will have the highest burden while household in richer states will face a smaller burden."
23,Thieves steal,"In a major embarrassment for law-enforcement agencies, burglars stole 1.92 lakh from the Freedom Food Factory office inside the Kannur central jail complex. The robbery was discovered by the jail authorities on Thursday morning.According to initial reports, the money proceeds from the sale of jail chapattis and other dishes was kept on a table and burglars reportedly entered the room after breaking two locks. Interestingly, the room was situated just 20 metres away from the main gate which was manned by a special police team called Thunder Bolts.Jail authorities suspect that it was carried out by some inmates who were aware of the money kept inside the room. Finger print experts and forensic officials have visited the spot and all inmates linked to the jail canteen and cafeteria will be questioned. “Since the investigation is on we can’t divulge more. But it turned out to be a big embarrassment,” a senior official, who did not want to be named, admitted.Many jails in the state make tasty cuisine including chappati with chicken curry, biryani, Kerala porotta and many other dishes. Since rates are very economical there is a big demand for food from the jail called, Freedom Food Factory. In Thiruvananthapuram jail, the department runs an AC freedom cafe and fuel filling station also. Viyyur central jail in Thrissur launched a successful online delivery system with the help of food major Swiggy two years ago."
24,TN can share O2 if state’s needs are met: Madras HC,"Chennai: Tamil Nadu can help other states in need of oxygen amid the relentless surge in Covid-19 cases if it has good production capacity and its own needs were met, the Madras high court observed on Thursday. The court’s observation came after the state government informed that there is no shortage of oxygen or Remdesivir, a drug used in treatment of Covid-19 patients.The court had taken suo-motu cognizance of reports that the Centre had diverted supply of oxygen to other states without the consent of the Tamil Nadu government, and shortage of the antiviral drug. “We are one country. If we have the resources here, we must share it,” a bench comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said. The bench, however, raised concerns over the new pricing of Covid-19 vaccines and the financial burden it would cause on lower income groups. The observation also came shortly before the Supreme Court took suo-motu cognisance of the prevailing Covid-19 situation and sought a “national plan” to fight various issues on Friday. Earlier in the day, Banerjee had directed advocate general (AG) Vijay Narayan to focus on four areas -- the availability of the antiviral drug, oxygen, ventilators and vaccines. He also directed additional solicitor general (ASG) R Sankaranarayanan, who was representing the Centre, to be present for the hearing at 2.15 pm. During the hearing later, the state government informed the court that Tamil Nadu has a storage capacity of 1,167 tonnes of oxygen with a daily manufacturing capacity of 400 tonnes and that only 250 tonnes were being used for treatment as of now. Additionally, Puducherry has a production capacity of 150 tonnes, it added.“Recently, about 65 tonnes of oxygen were diverted from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana but it did not affect our capacity at all,” the AG said. Out of 9,600 ventilators, 5,887 are earmarked for Covid-19 treatment in government hospitals. On the other hand, 3,000 ventilators are available in private hospitals. 3,10,000 vials of Remdesivir which is more than enough to meet contingencies, he added. The government also said that it is prepared to face any emergency and that a contingency plan was being prepared in case of an unforeseen situation. At present, there is no shortage in the four areas, it added. Taking note of the new pricing for vaccines announced by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the court asked the ASG to consider the financial burden it would cause on the citizens. On Wednesday, the SII, which locally manufactures the Covishield vaccine, fixed the price at 400 for government and 600 for private players per dose. “If the people do not take the vaccine, they will continue to remain as carriers and spreaders,” the bench said, taking into consideration that all those above 18 years of age would be eligible for the jab from May 1. It also urged the Centre to consider the requirements of the less privileged and those without basic resources and adequate jobs in the wake of the 2020 lockdown.Besides this, the court called for special measures to ensure minimum spread during Ramzan and on May 2 when counting of votes for the April 6 assembly elections will be conducted. The court said it was not interfering in the state’s functioning but wanted to ensure stricts measures were in place to tackle any emergency situation. The bench adjourned the hearing for Monday when the state is expected to submit more data on availability of hospital beds and vaccines."
25,"UAE, Australia, Oman ban travel from India","New Delhi The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Australia and Oman on Thursday joined the list of countries that have imposed travel restrictions on India in the wake of a massive surge in coronavirus infections, either completely barring or restricting flights from the country. The National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority and the General Civil Aviation Authority of the UAE announced the temporary suspension of all flights from India and the entry of transit passengers for a period of 10 days from April 25. Cargo flights between the two sides were exempted from the ban.People who transited through India in the past 14 days will also be barred from entering the UAE and the travel ban will be reviewed after 10 days, according to the announcement.The ban will not apply to UAE nationals, diplomatic passport holders, official delegations, and “golden residency” visa holders, though they will be required to take further preventive measures such as a 10-day quarantine and a RT-PCR test at the airport. Flights between Indian cities and Dubai have been among the busiest routes even during the pandemic as the UAE is home to more than three million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. On Thursday, Singapore further tightened restrictions for travellers from India, mainly to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in its crowded workers’ dormitories. Officials acknowledged that the move would impact the construction and marine sectors, which employ a large number of people from India and other South Asian countries. The UAE became the third country after the UK and Oman to bar the entry of Indian nationals even as the daily infections surged past the 300,000-mark. On Wednesday, Oman barred the entry of travellers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh from April 24. The ban will also cover travellers who transited through any of the three South Asian countries over the past 14 days, Oman’s Supreme Committee announced. The Australian government has decided to temporarily reduce the number of flights from India by 30% after registering a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19. People coming from high-risk countries such as India will also have to test negative for Covid-19 at least 72 hours before boarding a flight to Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the reduction will apply to government-organised repatriation flights and commercial flights. The change will take effect “in the months ahead”, he said without giving details. Authorities in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT) said there would be changes to the schedule of repatriation flights from India to Howard Springs and the requirements for travellers. “All repatriation flights not yet booked but planned for the NT for May will now be deferred until June,” chief minister Michael Gunner was quoted as saying by ABC News. “Anyone returning from India on these flights and all flights thereafter will be required to isolate for two weeks prior to departure,” he said. The move follows the Howard Springs quarantine facility dealing with the highest number of Covid-19 cases since it began handling repatriation flights last year, with most cases recorded among arrivals from India. Singapore on Thursday announced that all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a history of travel to India within the last 14 days wouldn’t be allowed entry into the country from April 24. This includes travellers transiting through India and those who had obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore, officials said. “We know that this major move will have an impact on our construction, marine and process sectors. And many local SMEs and contractors will be badly impacted,” Lawrence Wong, co-chair of Singapore’s Covid-19 multi-ministry task force, told a news conference. Singapore’s health ministry had on Tuesday said Covid-19 border measures would be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The US, the UK and New Zealand have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India or issued advisories against travelling to India in the backdrop of a massive spike in coronavirus cases. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga have called off planned visits to India because of the Covid-19 situation."
50,Commonwealth panel acknowledges racism in honoring war dead,"The investigation found that at least 116,000 people - and possibly as many as 350,000 - were either not comme... Read More

LONDON: The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has apologized after an investigation found that at least 161,000 mostly Africans and Indians who died fighting for the British Empire during World War I weren't properly honored due to ""pervasive racism.""

The investigation found that at least 116,000 people - and possibly as many as 350,000 - were either not commemorated by name or weren't commemorated at all, according to findings released Thursday. In addition, between 45,000 and 54,000 casualties were ""commemorated unequally.""

""We apologize unreservedly for the historical wrongs found in this report and for failing to live up to founding principle, of 'equality of treatment in death,'"" the commission said after the findings were released.

The commission appointed a committee to investigate claims of unequal treatment of war dead following a 2019 TV documentary presented by David Lammy, a member of Parliament from the opposition Labour Party. The commission oversees the graves of more than 1.7 million service personnel from the former British Empire who died during the two world wars.

50,Georgia park honoring confederacy gets first Black chair,"Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday announced that he had appointed the Rev. Abraham Mosley to serve as chairman of t... Read More

ATLANTA: The board overseeing an Atlanta area park that has centuries-old ties to the Ku Klux Klan and contains the largest Confederate monument ever crafted will be headed for the first time by an African American.

Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday announced that he had appointed the Rev. Abraham Mosley to serve as chairman of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the state authority responsible for overseeing Stone Mountain Park about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The park is a popular hiking and tourist site but is replete with Confederate imagery.

Mosley, pastor of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Athens, Georgia, was previously a member of the association's board. His elevation to chairman comes as the park's Confederate symbols face renewed opposition, with some calling on park leaders to stop maintaining its signature feature - a colossal sculpture of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson that is carved into the mountain's northern face.

Association CEO Bill Stephens told WSB-TV the board will hear ideas at a meeting on Monday about how to change the park in ways he thinks will balance its historical record.

Mosley urged patience.

""Certainly, there are mounting problems that have been brought before us. But we've got to handle them one at a time,"" he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Kemp said in a statement that he was confident Mosley would ""continue to rely on his experience in bringing people together"" as chairman of the association.

The Stone Mountain Action Coalition, an advocacy group, last year proposed that the association remove Confederate flags at the base of the mountain, change the names of streets and other park features with Confederate affiliations and refocus the park on themes such as racial reconciliation and justice. Meymoona Freeman, a leader of the group, said it wanted to see the carving of Lee, Davis and Jackson transformed into a natural space. The sculpture has special protection enshrined in Georgia law, which calls on the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to protect the site as a ""Confederate Memorial and public recreation area,"" according to the association's website.

The Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement it was ""encouraged"" by Mosley's appointment.

""It is our hope that the appointment of Reverend Mosley to this position of leadership is the first of many changes at this public park that will result in the immediate and complete removal of symbols, monuments, flags, street, place and building names, events and activities that honor and celebrate the Confederacy and the Ku Klux Klan,"" the Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement.

51,"Dumping Donald Trump's policies, Joe Biden leads world again in fight against climate change","US President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52 per cent by the... Read More

WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52 per cent by the end of this decade. With this, Biden reverses the hands-off policy of his isolationist and science-sceptic predecessor Donald Trump , restoring a global approach in an interdependent world in the throes of a pandemic.

Forty world leaders -- including heads from China, India, Russia, Japan, and UK -- pitched their views and ideas at a virtual summit where Biden, introduced by his vice-president Kamala Harris, called the need for addressing global warming ""a moral imperative, an economic imperative.""

""The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction is mounting,"" he said in his opening remarks, vowing that US would do its part to cut its 2005 level emissions by 50 to 52 per cent by 2030. He further asserted that his approach will create jobs and boost economies.

The White House said the US President's goal roughly doubles a target set by President Barack Obama in 2015 as part of the Paris climate accord, and he plans to formalise the new goal in a submission to the United Nations.

Biden's pledge will require a fundamental change in the ""American way of life"" cherished by the country's nativist base, premised on unsparing and uncaring use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. A $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan which includes a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and money to electrify the vehicle fleet are among the steps the Biden administration had proposed. The plan triggered resentment in mostly Trumpian circle of climate change sceptics which believes Washington should not worry about the rest of the world and simply do what is best for the American economy that thrives on consumption.

Illustrative of the common global concern on the issue despite severe differences on other matters, leaders of Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, UK and others -- many with serious on-going bilateral spats -- joined the virtual summit to broadly align themselves with the overall goal of reducing emissions.

Biden, who spoke from the East Room of the White House decorated with plants and greenery on the occasion of Earth Day , was later joined by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and climate czar John Kerry as Washington returned to a leadership role to tackle a global crisis that has momentarily taken a backseat due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand all of us, all of us and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies. We have to step up,"" he said in words that could well apply to the pandemic.

In his speech, Prime Minister Modi made no new commitments but announced an India-US climate and clean energy partnership to mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations. He also maintained that India's per capita emissions are far smaller than other major emitters -- a pointed rebuttal to global powers often putting China, which has five times more emissions than India, in the same basket.

51,"Missile from Syria lands in Israel, triggers Israel strike","This file image made from a video aired on January 7, 2005, by Israeli television station Channel 10, shows wh... Read More

JERUSALEM: A Syrian anti-aircraft missile landed in southern Israel early Thursday, setting off air raid sirens near the country's top-secret nuclear reactor, the Israeli military said. In response, it said it attacked the missile launcher and air-defense systems in neighboring Syria.

Israeli media later described the Syrian missile as an ""errant"" projectile, not a deliberate attack deep inside Israel. In recent years, Israel has repeatedly launched air strikes at Syria, including at military targets linked to foes Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, both allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Such strikes routinely draw Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Thursday's exchange was unusual because the Syrian projectile landed deep inside Israel.

Syria's state news agency SANA said the exchange began with an Israeli air strike on Dumeir, a suburb of the capital of Damascus . Dumeir is believed to house Syrian army installations and batteries as well as bases and weapons depots belonging to Iran-backed militias. SANA said four soldiers were wounded.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an opposition war monitoring group based in Britain that tracks Syria's civil war, said the Israeli strikes hit an air defense base belonging to the Syrian military and destroyed air defense batteries in the area. It said the Syrian military fired surface-to-air missiles in response.

Syrian media made no mention of an anti-aircraft missile landing deep inside Israel.

The Israeli military described the projectile that landed near the nuclear site as a surface-to-air missile, which is usually used for air defense against warplanes or other missiles. That could suggest the Syrian missile had targeted Israeli warplanes but missed and flew off errantly. However, Dimona, the Negev desert town where Israel's nuclear reactor is located, is some 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Damascus, a long range for an errantly fired surface-to-air missile.

The Israeli army said it had deployed a missile defense system to intercept the projectile and that there had been no damage. The Israeli military later said in a statement that an initial investigation indicated that the Syrian missile was not intercepted.

The air raid sirens were sounded in Abu Krinat, a village just a few kilometers (miles) from Dimona. Explosions heard across Israel might have been the air-defense systems.

Apparent missile fragments were found in a swimming pool in Ashalim, a community approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Dimona. Israeli troops arrived at the scene and collected the fragments.

The military said that in response to the incoming missile, it launched an air strike at the battery that launched the anti-aircraft missile and other surface-to-air batteries in Syria.

The exchange between Israel and Syria comes against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, a key ally of Syria. Iran, which maintains troops and proxies in Syria, has accused Israel of a series of attacks on its nuclear facilities, including sabotage at its Natanz nuclear facility on April 11, and vowed revenge. It also threatened to complicate U.S.-led attempts to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.

51,Sri Lanka expels ship carrying nuclear material for China,"File photo used for representation

COLOMBO: Sri Lankan authorities on Wednesday expelled an Antigua-registered ship that entered the island's territory without declaring a radioactive cargo bound for China.

The country's Atomic Energy Regulatory Council said the MV BBC Naples was asked to leave after it was found to be in the Chinese-run port of Hambantota on Tuesday night carrying uranium hexafluoride.

""The ship failed to declare its dangerous cargo - uranium hexafluoride - and we decided to order it to leave our waters immediately,"" council director general Anil Ranjith told AFP.

The ship had come from Rotterdam but authorities did not say where in China it was headed.

Ranjith said it was an offence to enter a port without declaring the material, which is used to enrich uranium, the fuel for nuclear power stations and weapons.

Sri Lanka's opposition leader Sajith Premadasa demanded an investigation into the incident, describing it as a serious safety threat.

""The navy has not been allowed to board the vessel to carry out an inspection,"" Premadasa said.

There was no immediate comment from the government.

Hambantota port was leased to China in 2017 for 99 years after the Colombo government was unable to repay $1.4 million it had borrowed from Beijing to build it.

Hambantota, about 260 kilometres (162 miles) south of Colombo, is near key Indian Ocean shipping lanes.

The entry of two Chinese submarines into Colombo in 2014 angered neighbouring India, the traditional regional power which is competing with Beijing for influence in the Indian Ocean.

Since then, Sri Lanka has not allowed Chinese submarine visits.

51,Syria receives batch of UN vaccines to speed up virus fight,"DAMASCUS: The Syrian government received a batch of 203,000 Covid-19 vaccines Thursday, the health minister said, in a move aimed at speeding up a sluggish inoculation process in the war-torn country.The arrival of the United Nations-secured jabs came as a new wave of infections has overwhelmed medical centers around Syria . The AstraZeneca vaccines will be part of a campaign aiming to vaccinate 20% of the country's population before the end of the year.Syria's government controls two-thirds of the country, with the rest held by rebels and Kurdish factions. Millions have fled the country or been displaced, and the war has killed some half a million people from the pre-war population of 23 million.Health Minister Hassan Ghabbash made the announcement during a news conference held in the capital Damascus. He said the vaccine will be given first to frontline workers, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.Akjemal Magtymova, the representative of the World Health Organization in Syria, said that the government drafted a plan with the WHO and UN children's agency UNICEF to distribute the vaccine equally across the country.Thursday's announcement came a day after Syria's last rebel-held enclave received its first batch of 53,800 Covid-19 vaccines, brought in from neighboring Turkey.The 203,000 jabs that arrived in Damascus will cover government-held areas and those under the control of Kurdish fighters in the northeast. Hundreds of thousands more are scheduled to arrive in the coming months.""The priority for immunization will be frontline health workers who are the first line of defense against COVID ,"" said Ted Chaiban, regional director for the Middle East and north Africa at UNICEF. Speaking with The Associated Press from neighboring Jordan, Chaiban added that after health workers, older people will be vaccinated.The Syrian government has registered over 21,500 cases - including 1,483 deaths - in areas under its control since the first case was reported in March 2020. Over 21,000 infections and over 640 deaths have been recorded in rebel-held northwestern Syria, while the Kurdish areas in the northeast registered 14,400 cases including 477 deaths.Officials in government-controlled areas had already rolled out limited vaccinations following an announcement by Damascus in February that it received an undetermined amount of vaccine from an unnamed friendly country.Separately, the United Arab Emirates said it sent a shipment of Covid-19 vaccine doses that arrived Tuesday in Damascus to help Syria fight the pandemic. It didn't say how many doses or which vaccine.The WHO had said the vaccination campaign in Syria was expected to start in April. It aims to inoculate 20% of the population by the end of 2021."
52,'Pride and hope': Alexei Navalny praises protests in his support,"Mass street protests in support of Navalny swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia on Wednesday... Read More

MOSCOW: Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an emotional message from behind bars Thursday that he felt ""pride and hope"" after learning from his lawyer about the mass protests demanding his freedom that swept Russia the previous night.

""Here it is - the salvation of Russia. You. Those who came out. Those who didn't come out but supported it. Those who didn't support it publicly, but sympathized,"" Navalny said in an Instagram post.

The 44-year-old, who is in his fourth week of hunger strike, said he hadn't known ""what was really happening"" because he only has access to one TV channel in prison, but his lawyer visited him on Thursday and got him up to speed about the events on Wednesday. ""And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.""

""People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything,"" said Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin 's most prominent opponent. ""They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case. Russia will be happy.""

Mass street protests in support of Navalny swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia on Wednesday night. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.

Unlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing quickly growing crowds to swarm streets and squares for several hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests and offers legal aid, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.

But overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests across the country on Wednesday night, with more than 800 occurring in St. Petersburg.

It was unclear whether the demonstrations matched the size and intensity of the nationwide protests that broke out in January after Navalny was arrested.

Leonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, maintained in the YouTube live stream about the protests that Wednesday's turnout exceeded January's, while the number of arrests was several times lower.

Independent political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout on Wednesday was somewhat comparable to that in January, indicating that the harsh crackdown that followed previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.

Hundreds of people were jailed in the aftermath of the January demonstrations, and a number of Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.

""In recent months, the authorities have made very serious attempts to (discourage protests) by tightening the screws, and many - including me - had serious concerns that much fewer people would turn up,"" Gallyamov told The Associated Press Thursday.

Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin - accusations Russian officials reject.

Soon after, a court found that the politician's stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction, and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.

Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.

Navalny's doctors said last week that the politician's test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys. He ""could die at any moment,"" his physician Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.

Navalny's allies had called the Wednesday protest in light of the alarming news, saying his life was at stake.

52,Putin vows a 'quick and tough' Russian response for its foes,"The warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup nea... Read More

MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday sternly warned the West against encroaching further on Russia's security interests, saying Moscow's response will be ``quick and tough'' and make the culprits bitterly sorry for their action.

The warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back.

``I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,'' Putin said. ``Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time.''

Moscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn't threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.

``We really don't want to burn the bridges,'' Putin said. ``But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia's response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough.''

As Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny , and a human rights group said over 1,000 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt.

The politician, who is Putin's most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials' refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline.

In his speech, Putin pointed to Russia's moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully.

In an apparent reference to the US and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ``unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others.'' He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ``openly boorish'' actions by others.

The Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 US presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies _ activities Moscow has denied. The US ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money.

Russia retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials, and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.

``Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,'' Putin said during Wednesday's address. ``If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position.''

In an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia.

``Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,'' he said.

In an apparent reference to the US allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling's ``Jungle Book.'' ``They howl to please their lord,'' he said.

Russia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague's move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats.

Putin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko , allegedly involving a blockade of the country's capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month.

``The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,'' Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014.

Russia responded to Yanukovych's ouster by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country's east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland.

Putin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall.

He put forward incentives to help the economy recover from the pandemic and promised new social payments focusing on families with children.

53,"Car bombing at hotel in southwest Pakistan kills 4, wounds 11","Police and a paramilitary soldier are seen after an explosion at a luxury hotel in Quetta, Pakistan.

QUETTA: A car bomb blast late on Wednesday ripped through a luxury hotel's parking area in the southwestern Pakistani city of Quetta, killing four people and wounding 11, officials said.

China's ambassador to Pakistan was staying at the hotel, but was not there when the bomb exploded, said Pakistan's interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad.

Provincial home minister Ziaullah Lango said the envoy was fine.

""An explosion has rocked the parking area of the Serena Hotel,"" police official Nasir Malik told Reuters, saying 11 people had been wounded. An official at a local civil hospital, Waseem Baig, said four people had died, and ""several others are in critical condition.""

""A car that was full of explosives exploded in the hotel,"" Ahmad told local ARY News TV.

The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing.

""It was a suicide attack in which our suicide bomber used his explosives-filled car in the hotel,"" a spokesman for the militant group Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) wrote in a text message to a Reuters reporter.

Chinese ambassador Nong Rong had earlier in the day met provincial chief minister Jam Kamal in the city, according to a tweet from the provincial government spokesman, Liaquat Shahwani.

Lango told reporters: ""I just met him. He is in high spirits,"" adding the envoy would complete his visit to Quetta on Thursday.

The Chinese Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.

The well-fortified hotel is next to the Iranian Consulate and the provincial parliament building. Quetta is the capital of the mineral-rich southwestern Balochistan province bordering Iran and Afghanistan, which has long been the scene of a low-level insurgency by local nationalists, who want more of a share in the regional resources.

The province is home to the newly expanded Gwadar deepwater port that is key to a planned $65 billion investment in China's Belt and Road Initiative economic corridor.

It was not clear whether the envoy or members of his delegation were a target of the attack, but Chinese nationals and their interests in the region have been attacked before by Taliban militants and nationalist insurgents.

53,"Covid-19 hits a new peak, infects climber on Everest","Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed that he has tested positive for Covid-19, in a blow to Nepal’s hopes for a bumper mountaineering season on the world’s highest peak.The pandemic wiped out last year’s season, but Nepal has eased quarantine rules in an effort to attract more climbers despite the difficulties of treating them if they contract the deadly disease.“My diagnosis is Covid-19,” Erlend Ness told AFP in a Facebook message. “I’m doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me).” Ness was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Kathmandu after spending time at Everest base camp. Norwegian broadcaster NRK, which interviewed him, reported that a sherpa in his party has also tested positive.“I really hope that none of the others get infected... high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they’re above 8,000 metres,” Ness told NRK. Breathing is already difficult at high altitudes, so any outbreak of disease among climbers presents urgent health risks.“The plan was to get fast high up in the mountains to make sure that we wouldn’t get infected... I’ve been unlucky and I could have done more by myself when it comes to sanitary precautions,” Ness added.One hospital in Kathmandu confirmed it had taken in patients from Everest who had contracted the coronavirus disease but couldn’t give a number.“I can’t share the details, but some evacuated from Everest have tested positive,” Prativa Pandey, the medical director at Kathmandu’s CIWEC Hospital, told AFP. But Mira Acharya, a spokesperson for Nepal’s tourism department, said it has so far not received any reports of Covid-19 among climbers.Dawa Steven Sherpa of Asian Trekking said everyone at base camp was concerned. Nepal issued 377 permits this year to climb the mountain, and the final number is expected to exceed 381 handed out in 2019."
53,Pak Taliban behind blast in Quetta,"The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for Wednesday night’s deadly suicide blast at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in the southwest of the country, as the death toll went up to five.A bomber detonated the explosives while inside a vehicle in the car park of Serena Hotel - part of a five-star chain popular with diplomats and aid agencies - in the city of Quetta, capital of Balochistan province, police and the interior ministry said.Pakistan is fighting several low-level insurgencies in the impoverished province, waged by Islamist, separatist and sectarian groups.“The suicide bomber hit the security officials exactly as it was planned,” the spokesperson for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said in a statement.The country’s interior minister confirmed a suicide bomber had carried out the attack and pinned the blame on a “foreign hand”. “Our agencies will fight the efforts that are being made in the neighbouring country to reorganise the TTP,” said interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.Pakistan routinely accuses India of using insurgent groups, including in Afghanistan, as proxy forces to wage an ongoing shadow war between the arch rivals.China was among the first countries to react following the explosion, saying it strongly condemned the attack, although the Taliban said Pakistan security officials were the target of the blast.Describing the blast as a “terrorist attack”, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin confirmed in Beijing that a Chinese delegation was not present when the bomb detonated. Gu Wenliang, agriculture commissioner at China’s embassy in Pakistan, told Chinese newspaper Global Times that the bomb had detonated 10 minutes before their expected return.“I was walking through the car park when I heard a sudden loud sound and the earth shook under my feet,” said Khuda Baksh, a guard at the hotel. “Everyone was running for their lives before I lost consciousness.”For years, the TTP unleashed deadly attacks on urban centres across Pakistan from their bases along the Afghan border, where they provided shelter to an array of global jihadist groups including al-Qaeda."
54,Australia ends China deals on national interest grounds,"Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne. (AP)

CANBERRA: Australia has cancelled two Chinese ""Belt and Road'' infrastructure building initiative deals with a state government, provoking an angry response from Beijing.

The bilateral deals with Victoria state were among four vetoed under new laws that give the federal government power to overrule international agreements by lower-level administrations that violate the national interest, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said late Wednesday.

The ""Belt and Road'' deals struck with Beijing in 2018 and 2019 triggered the legislative response.

Victoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also canceled.

""I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,'' Payne said.

The Chinese Embassy in Australia said in a statement the decision ""further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations.''

""It is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself,'' the embassy said on Thursday, referring to the Australian government.

The Global Times , a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party , said in a headline: ""Australia faces serious consequences for unreasonable provocation against China.''

The move ""marks a significant escalation that could push icy bilateral relations into an abyss,'' the newspaper added.

Australia's bilateral relations with its most important trading partner are at their lowest point in decades. Chinese government ministers refuse to take phone calls from their Australian counterparts, and trade disruptions are widely seen as China imposing economic punishment.

But Payne said Thursday she did not expect China to retaliate.

""Australia is operating in our national interests. We are very careful and very considered in that approach.'' Payne said.

""It's about ensuring that we have a consistent approach to foreign policy across all levels of government, and it isn't about any one country,'' she said. ""It is most certainly not intended to harm Australia's relationships with any countries.''

Victoria's center-left Labor Party government said the Foreign Relations Act, under which the deals were cancelled, was a matter for the federal government.

""The Victorian government will continue to work hard to deliver jobs, trade and economic opportunities for our state,'' the statement said.

Victoria's opposition leader Michael O'Brien, who vowed to scrap the deals if he won elections next year, welcomed the federal government's decision.

O'Brien, who belongs to the same conservative Liberal Party as the foreign minister, said the Victorian government had ""given away major infrastructure contracts to Chinese-owned companies'' under one deal.

""In return, the Chinese government has smashed our farmers with tariffs on barley. They have smashed our wine exporters with trade sanctions,'' O'Brien told Melbourne Radio 3AW.

Observers have described the Victorian deals as vague and non-binding. Some suspect their value to the Chinese Communist Party was to exploit differences in opinion in Australia over ""Belt and Road'' deals, which critics argue can create debt traps for poor countries.

Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton said his government would not allow the Chinese Communist Party to use such deals with Australian states as ""propaganda.''

""Our problem is with the values or the virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party ,'' Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.

The party had militarized ports in the Asia-Pacific region and Australian security agencies had reported an increased level of foreign interference across the region, Dutton said.

""We're worried about cyberattacks and we're worried obviously about state governments that enter into compacts with the Communist Party against our national interests,'' Dutton said.

""We can't allow these sort of compacts, these sort of arrangements and friendships to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen,'' he added.

Scott Applewhite)

A decades-long movement to reshape the American political map took a further step Thursday as the House of Representatives approved a bill to make the nation’s capital the 51st state.

Voting along party lines with minority Republicans in opposition, the House approved the bill 216-208. That’s likely the easy part, though. The proposal faces a far tougher fight in the Senate, where simple Democratic control of the chamber won’t be enough.

The legislation proposes creating a 51st state with one representative and two senators, while a tiny sliver of land including the White House, the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall would remain as a federal district. Instead of the District of Columbia, the new state would be known

as Washington, Douglass Commonwealth named after famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who lived in Washington from 1877 until his death in 1895.

An identical statehood bill passed the House in 2020, but it quickly died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate. Now, with the 2020 elections leaving Democrats in control of both chambers and the White House, Republican senators may resort to a filibuster to stymie the statehood bill.

For lifelong statehood proponents like Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s long-serving and nonvoting delegate in the House, Thursday’s vote was a culmination of a life’s work.

“My service in the Congress has been dedicated to achieving equality for the people I represent, which only statehood can provide,” Norton said at a Wednesday news conference. “My life as a third-generation Washingtonian has marched toward this milestone.”

The measure has received strong support from President Joe Biden’s White House, which released a statement Tuesday calling Washington’s current status “an affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded”.

The White House praised Washington as worthy of statehood, with “a robust economy, a rich culture, and a diverse population of Americans from all walks of life who are entitled to full and equal participation in our democracy”.

The bill is certain to face GOP pushback, given that the proposed 51st state would be overwhelmingly Democratic. That opposition was on display during Thursday morning’s floor debates in advance of the vote.

The country’s founding fathers, “never wanted D.C. to be a state and then specifically framed the constitution to say so”, said Georgia Republican Rep. Jody Hice. “This is absolutely against what our founders intended and it ought to be soundly rejected.”

But Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly pointed out that Kentucky was once a part of Virginia, and was carved out as a state by a simple act of Congress.

Connolly argued that the federal district was a theoretical concept when first conceived, not a community with a higher population than two U.S. states.

“When the constitution was written, this place didn’t exist,” he said. “When people say this is not about race and partisanship, you can be sure it’s about race and partisanship.”

During a March hearing by the House oversight committee, a succession of GOP representatives claimed D.C. was unfit for statehood while calling the entire effort a cynical Democratic power play. Opponents proposed a variety of alternatives, from absolving Washingtonians of federal taxes to “retroceding” most of D.C. back into Maryland.

Contenting that Congress lacks the authority to change D.C.’s status is a frequent point of attack against the proposal “even though every state other than the original 13 was admitted to the union via congressional vote. Statehood opponents say D.C. is a special case that requires special steps.

Zack Smith, a legal fellow at the Heritage Institute, a conservative think tank, testified before Congress last month that since D.C.’s creation and limitations are are enshrined in Article I of the Constitution, its status can only be changed through a constitutional amendment.

He also argued that D.C. shouldn’t be made a state at all and that the Founding Fathers “intended this to be a federal district outside the jurisdiction of any one state”.

If the measure were to become law, Smith predicted a wave of lawsuits that would cloud the new state’s actions and any congressional legislation it touched.

“You’re basically looking at a lot of litigation,” Smith told The Associated Press. “Every legislative act of this new state would be called into question. … Things would be in a state of flux for years.”

D.C. has long chafed under its relationship with Congress, which has the power to essentially veto or alter any local laws. Its population is larger than that of Wyoming or Vermont and its estimated 712,000 residents pay federal taxes, vote for president and serve in the armed forces, but they have no voting representation in Congress.

The limitations of D.C.’s reality were put in stark relief last summer during a series of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and against general police brutality. After a night of widespread vandalism, President Donald Trump usurped D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s authority and called in a massive multiagency federal force to downtown. The law enforcement forces cleared peaceful protesters from a public street so Trump could pose for a photo outside a church."
54,EU looks to sue AstraZeneca over jab,"The European Commission is looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for under-delivering Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU, hobbling the bloc’s early roll-out of jabs, diplomats said on Thursday.The EU executive informed member state envoys of its plans on Wednesday, the diplomats told AFP, confirming information first published by the Politico website.They said any lawsuit against AstraZeneca would begin in a Belgian court - the jurisdiction agreed under the commission’s contract with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A European Commission spokesman, Eric Mamer, told journalists that “no decision has yet been taken”. Another spokesman, Stefan De Keersmaecker, added, “As you know, AstraZeneca is not delivering the number of doses which have been agreed upon in the contract... This is one of the reasons why we keep our options open together with member states to take any further steps.”AstraZeneca has so far delivered 31 million of the 120 million doses it had promised. It has warned it will likewise provide just 70 million of the 180 million more meant to be delivered over the rest of this year.US weekly jobless claims fall to one-year lowThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to a one-year low, suggesting layoffs were subsiding and strengthening expectations for another month of job growth in April.But the labour market recovery has a long way to go, with the report from the labour department showing at least 17.4mn people were collecting unemployment checks in early April.Initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020.Pressure on US to lift IPR protections on vaccinesThe Biden administration is weighing an appeal from progressive Democrats to accelerate global access to Covid-19 vaccines by supporting a waiver of IPR protections, a move opposed by big drugmakers.Lawmakers last week called on President Joe Biden to back a proposal before the WTO that seeks a broad waiver from obligations on the protection of IP rights. The lawmakers and allies including labour unions argue that the plan - backed by India, South Africa, and more than 50 other countries - would save more lives."
54,Pakistan court grants bail to opposition leader and PML-N chief Shehbaz Sharif,"PML-N chief and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif (File photo)

LAHORE: A Pakistani court on Thursday granted bail to the PML-N chief and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif , nearly eight months after he was arrested by the country's top anti-graft body over his alleged involvement in money laundering and assets beyond means cases.

A three-judge bench of the Lahore high court, headed by Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, gave a unanimous verdict in favour of 69-year-old Shehbaz, the younger brother of the three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif .

On April 14, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) celebrated after the two-member bench of the LHC granted bail to Shehbaz. However, later it was transpired that it was a split decision with Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, who had headed the bench, accepted his bail petition, while the other member, Justice Asjad Javed Ghural, had opposed it.

On this, the chief justice constituted a three-member bench to decide the matter.

Interestingly, Justice Ghural had accused Justice Dogar of issuing the bail granting short order âunilaterally'.

""It is shocking for me to observe here that it has been mentioned in the beginning paragraph of the said order that unanimous order qua grant of bail to the petitioner was announced, which is against the ground reality,"" Justice Gural had said.

On Thursday, the three-member bench (a referee bench) issued a short court order granting Shehbaz bail against furnishing two bail bonds worth PKR 5 million each. Shehbaz is expected be be released from jail on Friday.

Shehbaz was arrested in September 2020 in both cases by the National Accountability Bureau .

The NAB had alleged that Shehbaz's family had assets of around PKR 16.5 million till 1990, which increased to over PKR 7 billion in 2018 which were disproportionate to his known sources of income.

The NAB has already filed a case against Shehbaz in the accountability court. Shehbaz's counsel told the court since no investigation was pending against his client in these cases as the NAB had already filed a case against him, he should be granted bail.

Shehbaz is accused of beneficiary of assets held in the name of his family members and benamidars who had no sources to acquire such assets. NAB says, ""Shehbaz and other suspects committed offences of corruption and corrupt practices as envisaged under the provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 and money laundering as delineated in the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010.""

A total of 20 people had been nominated in the case. The other main suspects are Shehbaz's wife Nusrat, his sons Hamza (leader of opposition in Punjab assembly) and Suleman (who is absconding in the UK), and his daughters Rabia Imran and Javeria Ali.

Shehbaz's elder brother Nawaz Sharif has been in London since November 2019 on 'medical grounds'. The Imran Khan government has declared Sharif an absconder and cancelled his passport.

Nawaz left the country after the court granted him bail in the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case in which he was undergoing seven years imprisonment in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. He was also granted four-week bail on medical grounds to have his treatment abroad. The government declared him an absconder after he failed to justify prolonging his stay in London.

55,"India, China factor in regional prosperity; moment of choice for Pak: Afghan's Ghani","WASHINGTON: Asserting that China and India are to be a factor in the regional prosperity, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani has said it is ""a moment of choice"" for neighbouring Pakistan as all its calculations have been ""wrong"" so far.

Ghani, in an interview to CNN 's Fareed Zakaria which aired on Sunday, said that verbally, the leaders of Pakistan all fortunately acknowledge that they do not want the Taliban government in Afghanistan, that they would like to see a peaceful, stable, democratic government in the war-torn country.

âWe are key to their prosperity. The rate of growth in Afghanistan could enhance by two per cent in a stable and connected Afghanistan, we have to work together.

âSo, there are two optionsâ¦ Connect to Central Asia through us, share in the joint prosperity through the partnership for peace, gain international credibility and support that they're all in need of, or opt for chaos,â he said.

The country that would be most damaged by insecurity or a renewed civil war in Afghanistan is Pakistan, and in that case, it would be a lose proposition, Ghani said.

âIt's a moment of choice for Pakistan. All its calculations have been wrong,â the Afghanistan President said.

Afghanistan has in the past accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for terror groups that target its territory, especially the Afghan Taliban , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Haqqani group.

Responding to a question, Ghani said that China is not an interventionist power.

âIt does not want to get engaged with military or proxy wars, and Pakistan in terms of its foreign policy obviously is hedging between China and other countries, because it is still, its reliance on the rest of the region is quite significant. Pakistan can become an anchor of regional stability if it opts for peace in regional cooperation,â he said.

The discourse of Pakistan has changed, he said, adding that there was a security conference in Islamabad where the talk was really significantly about harmony and cooperation.

âTo expect that China, after the great COVID reset and the significant adverse impact will get involved in regional conflicts directly, I think is remote. Furthermore, we have a lot of positive relationships with China and the growth of China now is going to be the factor as growth of India for regional prosperity.

âAll of us are strong stakeholders not to get involved. And for Afghanistan, we do not want a replacement in terms of seeking to replace the United States and NATO with some form of patronage. We want to have a multi-aligned policy where we are friends with everybody and not part of their quarrels, and hence our agenda of permanent neutrality that will benefit everybody,â Ghani said.

Responding to a question on the withdrawal of US troops from his country by September 11, he said that this is a time of opportunity for Afghanistan.

âFor the Taliban and for Pakistan, it's a moment of choice. Will they opt to become a credible international stakeholder, with rules of game for a peaceful part of Asia and connectivity, or for opting for chaos?â he said.

âEqually for the Taliban, the major excuse that this is a war to get the international forces out of Afghanistan is over. There is no religious justification left for the war. Political settlement is a must. But the ball clearly is in the court of Taliban and their supporters,â Ghani added.

US President Joe Biden last week announced that the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan will start on May 1 and will be completed by September 11 this year, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York.

He said: ""It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.""

Biden has said that India, Pakistan, Russia, China, and Turkey have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan and these regional stakeholders should do more to bring peace in this war-torn country.

56,Britain's Heathrow Airport turns down airline requests for extra flights from India,"Travellers walk through Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport, amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Lo... Read More

Britain's Heathrow Airport has refused to allow extra flights from India before the country is added on Friday to Britain's ""red-list"" of locations from which most travel is banned due to a high number of Covid-19 cases, the airport said on Wednesday.

The move by Britain comes after it detected more than 100 cases of a coronavirus variant first identified in India, Health Minister Matt Hancock said on Monday.

""We've made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the Red List. This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they've been in India in the previous 10 days,"" Hancock had told parliament.

Heathrow Airport's refusal to allow extra flights from India was reported earlier by the BBC , with the airport adding that it turned down the requests from airlines because of concerns about queues at passport control.

The airport also told Reuters it did not want to exacerbate existing pressures at the border by allowing more passengers to fly in.

India now faces a coronavirus ""storm"" overwhelming its health system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national address on Tuesday, with the world's second-most populous nation reporting 295,041 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - the biggest daily rise reported in any country - stretching its hospitals to breaking point.

India's 2,023 deaths in one day were also its highest in the pandemic.

At least 24 Covid-19 patients in western India died on Wednesday when the oxygen supply to their ventilators ran out, amid a nationwide shortage of the gas and a surge in infections.

Health experts said India had let its guard down when the virus seemed to be under control during the winter, allowing big gatherings such as weddings and festivals.

Modi is himself facing criticism for addressing packed political rallies for local elections and allowing a religious festival to go ahead where millions gathered.

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"

MILAN: Italy's financial and fashion capital of Milan got a little buzzier on Thursday with a project that mixes biodiversity with art.

A bee collective introduced 17 new colonies to new designer hives, bringing to 1 million the city's population of honeybees cultivated by the Urban Beehives project . Creator Claudia Zanfi said the project aims to ""create an intersection between artistic language and biodiversity.""

The art is in the form of hives designed by international artists and the biodiversity comes from the bees , which help pollinate plants in the city's expanding green spaces.

The new hives were introduced to their homes in the Cascina Merlata Park, 20 hectares (50 acres) of new park dedicated last year on land used for the Expo 2015 World's Fair, which focused on food, food security and nutrition.

The seven-year-old, prize-winning project is aimed at educating the public about the importance of bees to the environment, while boosting their population and producing a sweet treat of honey. It's billed as the biggest urban bee collective in Europe, with hives placed in four public parks in the city.

""Urban Beehives is a redevelopment project of urban green through the reintroduction of bees in the city,'' Zanfi said. ""There always have been bees in the city, but creating a public space for them is what is new.""

Starting next week, Zanfi's group Green Island will offer courses and workshops at the park on beekeeping and the bees' critical role in helping maintain a healthy planet.

Two years ago, the Rome-based Food and Agricultural Organization sounded an alarm that declining bee populations pose threat to global food security and nutrition.

""The bees have a fundamental role for our lives, but also for the life of the planet,'' Zanfi said.

58,Russia set to pull troops back from Ukraine border,"Russia said it will begin pulling thousands of troops back from areas near the Ukrainian border starting on Friday, in a step that could calm tensions with the West that have surged in recent weeks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the move, saying in a tweet it “reduces tension”.The military units will return to their bases by May 1, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday in Crimea, where he’s on a visit to review manoeuvres.“The goals of these surprise checks were fulfilled completely. The forces showed their ability to reliably defend the country,” he told commanders, announcing the end of the operation. “The military activity of Nato in this region has significantly increased.”Western officials say Russia moved as many as 100,000 troops, as well as tanks, warplanes and other equipment, to areas near the border with Ukraine in recent weeks, the largest such build-up in years. The US and its European allies called on the Kremlin to pull the forces back, but Moscow said it’s free to deploy its military wherever needed on its territory.‘Moscow got its message across’“Moscow thinks that it got its message across,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy, which advises the Kremlin. “There’s been some de-escalation and now the confrontation has returned to the political and diplomatic sphere.”There was no immediate sign the withdrawal would take place as announced and Russia has changed plans in the past. The defence ministry said it would leave the tanks and other equipment of one of the major units in the area near the border ahead of exercises planned for the fall.Amid the crisis, US President Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin to appeal to the Russian leader to reduce tensions, offering the prospect of a summit meeting.Russia denied its build-up was a threat to Ukraine, but the Kremlin had charged the government in Kiev with planning an assault on Donbas separatist regions in the east of the country that are backed by Moscow. The Ukrainian government rejected those claims and accused Moscow of planning a military incursion of its own."

KABUL: The US military has begun shipping equipment and winding down contracts with local service providers ahead of the May 1 start of the final phase of its military pullout from Afghanistan , a US Defense Department official said Thursday.

The pullout under US President Joe Biden marks the end of America's longest war after a 20-year military engagement. Currently, some 2,500 US soldiers and about 7,000 allied forces are still in Afghanistan.

In February last year, the US military began closing its smaller bases. In mid-April, the Biden administration announced that the final phase of the withdrawal would begin May 1 and be completed before Sept. 11.

Since then, the military has been shipping equipment and winding down local contracts for services such as trash pickup and maintenance work, the US official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.

While preparations are under way, troops likely won't begin to depart for a few weeks, he said, adding that ""we won't see a coming down of the (troop) numbers"" until remaining bases close.

There have been indications that the pullout could be completed well before Sept. 11, which marks the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terror attack on the U.S. and the trigger for the US invasion of Afghanistan.

On Wednesday, Germany's Defense Ministry said discussions are underway among military planners with the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Kabul for a possible withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan as early as July 4.

In the short term, America will likely increase its troop presence in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said last Friday. The additional troops would be in Afghanistan over the coming weeks and months to help with what the herculean task of wrapping up 20 years of war.

While much of the equipment headed back to the US will be shipped by air, the military will also use land routes through Pakistan and north through Central Asia, the Defense Department official said.

The U.S. equipment that is neither shipped back to America nor given to the Afghan National Security forces will be sold to contractors, who will, in turn, sell it in the local markets.

""You'll most likely start seeing it eventually showing up in bazaars as scrap,"" said the official.

The Taliban, meanwhile, were non-committal when asked by the AP whether the insurgents would attack departing US and NATO troops. ""It's too early for these issues, nothing can be said about the future,"" said Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem.

In a deal the Taliban signed last year with former President Donald Trump , the final US withdrawal deadline was set as May 1. Under the agreement, the Taliban promised not to attack US and NATO troops but they also later promised ""consequences"" if Washington defied the May 1 deadline.

59,Hong Kong journalist convicted for accessing public records,"Choy Yuk-ling was arrested in November on charges of falsely declaring why she was obtaining license plate inf... Read More

HONG KONG: A Hong Kong journalist was found guilty on Thursday of making false statements in obtaining information for an investigation into an attack on anti-government protesters, in the latest blow to press freedom in the city as authorities continue their crackdown on dissent.

Choy Yuk-ling , also known as Bao Choy, was arrested in November on charges of falsely declaring why she was obtaining license plate information from a publicly accessible database. She was attempting to track down the perpetrators of a violent attack by a mob of white-clad men on protesters in a subway station in 2019 for an investigative documentary for public broadcaster RTHK.

Principal Magistrate Ivy Chui said the Road Traffic Ordinance only allows the public to obtain vehicle ownership records for transport or traffic-related matters, legal matters, or for vehicle purchases.

She said Choy declared in her online application that she would use the information for ""other traffic and transport related issues."" The application does not provide an option for journalistic research.

Choy, a freelancer affiliated with RTHK , pleaded not guilty. She was convicted on two counts of making false statements and fined 6,000 Hong Kong dollars ($775).

The documentary Choy was working on, titled 7.21 Who Owns the Truth , also explored the behavior of Hong Kong police during last year's anti-government protests. Police were accused of not intervening during the attack in the subway station.

Ahead of the court session, supporters of Choy held placards that read ""Journalism is not a crime"" and chanted slogans.

Media groups are concerned that Hong Kong's new security law, which outlaws secession, subversion and foreign collusion to interfere in the city's internal matters, could be used against journalists reporting on issues considered related to national security.

60,China says ready to help but India looks elsewhere for oxygen,"NEW DELHI: With India reeling under the Covid-19 pandemic, China said Thursday it stood ready to provide India with necessary support and assistance to get the situation under control.However, while India is looking to import oxygen from abroad as the union health ministry had said last week, official sources said China was not among the countries India was looking to source oxygen from. India for now has identified potential sources mainly in the Gulf and Singapore.Describing Covid-19 as a common enemy of all mankind that necessitated international solidarity and mutual assistance, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday Beijing had taken note of the recent ""grave situation in India with a temporary shortage of anti-epidemic medical supplies"".India had sourced medical equipment from China last year but mainly through commercial agreements. Both India and China have supplied Covid-19 vaccines to south Asian countries even though countries like Sri Lanka and Nepal started to accept Chinese vaccines only after supplies from India dried up. Faced with a grim domestic situation, India is no longer allowing vaccine export as it was earlier, even though it hasn't officially banned it.China was Thursday reported to have convened another meeting with countries in the region including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for a coordinated response to the pandemic. Apart from these 3 countries, the Maldives has also asked the Indian government to ensure that the Serum Institute of India honours the commercial agreements signed with them for the Covishield vaccine.In the case of Bangladesh, Dhaka had signed a contract for 30 million doses of the vaccine but, according to the Bangladesh media, Serum has supplied only 7 million doses since January.India ambassador to Bangladesh Vikram Doraiswami assured Dhaka Thursday that India was working on increasing the availability and supply of vaccines.Bangladesh too said Thursday that while it was making efforts to procure the remaining vaccines in accordance with the agreement signed with Serum, it was also making an effort to procure vaccines from China and Russia under a commercial agreement or joint production. ""Bangladeshâs diplomatic missions in China and Russia are in communication with the governments of those countries as well as the vaccine manufacturing companies there,"" said Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud bin Momen."
60,China willing to help India in Covid-19 fight,"BEIJING: China is willing to help India as it fights a surge in coronavirus cases, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday.China is aware that the epidemic in India has been severe recently, and there is a temporary shortage of necessary materials for epidemic prevention, said Wang Wenbin , a spokesman at the foreign ministry. He was responding to a question at a regular media briefing about what action China is taking in view of the spreading epidemic in India.""China is willing to provide the necessary support and help,"" Wang said, without giving details of what such assistance might consist of. ""The novel coronavirus is a common enemy of all mankind, and the global community needs to unite as one to fight against epidemics.""India recorded nearly 315,000 new coronavirus infections on Thursday and its health services are struggling to cope. Health officials in northern and western India said they were in crisis, with most hospitals full and running out of oxygen."
61,Pope warns Earth heading for self-destruction without action,"ROME: Pope Francis warned Thursday that the world is âon a path of self-destructionâ if political leaders fail to courageously use the Covid-19 pandemic as a chance to make the planet a fairer and greener place.In a video message released on World Earth Day , Francis said political leaders have an opportunity to âcome out betterâ following lessons learned about the social injustices laid bare during the pandemic.âBoth global catastrophes, Covid and the climate, show that we don't have time to waste,"" Francis said.âTime is pressing on us and, as Covid-19 has shown, we do have the means to meet the challenge. We have the means. It's time to act, we're at the limit.â Francis has made his environmental appeal a hallmark of his papacy, denouncing how wealthy countries have plundered God's creation for profit at the expense of poor and indigenous peoples.In his message, Francis said the adversity humanity has faced in the pandemic should drive leaders to pursue innovation and invention to better protect the planet.He appealed to âall leaders of the world: to act boldly, act fairly, and always tell the truth to people, so that people know how to protect themselves from the destruction of the planet and how to protect the planet from the destruction that many times we trigger.â"
62,UK-India full trade deal is in sight: London think tank,"LONDON: A free trade agreement between the UK and India ""is very much a possibility"", according to a new briefing paper by London think tank Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) published ahead of the virtual call between PMs Narendra Modi and Boris Johnson on Monday.

The paper, authored by Indian-origin IEA academic fellow Shanker Singham, who served as trade adviser to the US government and is a member of the Bretton Woods Committee, also states that the UK and India are set to announce an enhanced trade partnership (ETP).

He said that whilst a trade deal would lead to a substantial increase in bilateral trade flows, it would have an even more significant role to play in terms of the geo-strategic dimension as India could be brought into an alignment of nations, including the US, UK and Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) members, as a bulwark against the threat from China.

""Chinaâs threat is in large measure based on its network of anti-competitive market distortions, its state-owned enterprises and the projection of its market distorting practices on the rest of the world. The India-UK relationship could play a significant role in the containment of these practices,"" it states. ""The potential for the UK to use the ETP, and even the launch of FTA negotiations to lock the Indian government into a broader coalition of willing partners could be a game-changer for the Indo-Pacific region.""

The UK, India and the existing CPTPP countries constitute around half of the global economy.

""Many countries have sought to do a trade deal with India, but these have proved notoriously difficult to close. It is possible that the UK has the key to unlock the Indian puzzle,"" Singham writes.

He states an FTA would have commercial benefits to both countries. The UK would like to see Scotch whisky tariffs reduced and greater access for UK financial, legal and professional services in India. India wants the UK to be more accommodating of business and student visas, in particular for IT executives. If the UK lowers its tariff schedule further below the EUâs Common External Tariff and diverges from EU bans on products, then Indian agriculture could substantially benefit too, it adds.

But the report warns that FTAs are ""irrelevant if the rule of law and contracts are flouted, or if anticompetitive market distortions are the order of the day"".

Citing the cases of Vodafone, Cairn Energy and Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd, the report raises concerns that the Indian government is ""systematically breaking bilateral investment treaties (BITs), ignoring court and arbitration rulings, cancelling contracts, expropriating private property and using state institutions to prosecute the very parties whose rights they should be protecting"".

Singham urges Johnson in his talks with Modi to push the Indian government to recognise and respect its existing commitments under bilateral investment treaties.

""Future British investors in India will expect the Indian government to abide by the BIT, including arbitration judgments. If this cannot be certain, then why would any investor feel confident about the provisions of a future FTA?"" the report asks.

63,Search for Indonesia submarine focuses on oil slick off Bali,"Indonesia's navy is searching for the submarine that went missing north of the resort island of Bali with a nu... Read More

JAKARTA: Indonesia's navy ships are intensely searching the waters where one of its submarines was last detected before it disappeared with 53 people on board, as neighboring countries are set to join the complex operation.

The KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a training exercise Wednesday when it missed a scheduled reporting call. Officials reported an oil slick and the smell of diesel fuel near the starting position of its last dive, about 96 kilometers (60 miles) north of the resort island of Bali .

Indonesia's military said that five navy ships and a helicopter were taking part in the search while a hydro-oceanographic survey ship equipped with underwater detection capabilities is on its way to the site around the oil spills. Officials said they had not yet been linked to the missing submarine.

Rescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia are expected to arrive Saturday. The military said Australia, the United States , Germany, France, Australia, Russia, India and Turkey have also offered assistance.

Some worry that the area may be too deep to locate or retrieve the ship, suggesting potential challenges facing the search operation.

""There looks like a terrible tragedy and it's in a very deep part of waters, 700 or 800 meters (2,297 feet or 2,625 feet) deep potentially,"" Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB .

""It makes it very difficult for the recovery or for location. But there's some assistance that potentially we can apply and the Chief of the Defense Force (Angus Campbell) obviously reached out to his counterpart to say whatever Australia can provide, we will,"" he said.

The submarine was carrying 49 crew members, its commander and three gunners, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.

The navy said an electrical failure may have occurred during the dive, causing the submarine to lose control and become unable to undertake emergency procedures that would have allowed it to resurface. It said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet).

The German-built submarine, which has been in service in Indonesia since 1981, was rehearsing for a missile-firing exercise that was to take place on Thursday. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto and other military leaders were to attend.

Indonesia currently has a fleet of five submarines and plans to operate at least eight by 2024.

The world's largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.

Last year, president Joko widodo reaffirmed the country's sovereignty during a visit to the islands at the edge of the South China Sea , one of the busiest sea lanes where China is embroiled in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors.

His visit came a week after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang insisted that Chinese fishermen are free to conduct activities in areas China claims as its traditional fishing grounds, which partly overlap Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.

Geng's statement drew indignation in Indonesia and prompted the military to increase its forces at the islands. Although China has been making such claims for years, recently dozens of Chinese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard vessels, have reportedly made more aggressive moves in the area and ignored Indonesian warnings to leave.

64,"Sanctions-battered Iran, weary of pandemic, faces worst wave","TEHRAN: As Iran faces what looks like its worst wave of the coronavirus pandemic yet, Tehran commuters still pour into its subway system and buses each working day, even as images of the gasping ill are repeatedly shown on state television every night.After facing criticism for downplaying the virus last year, Iranian authorities have put partial lockdowns and other measures back in place to try and slow the virus' spread.But in this nation of 84 million people, which faces crushing US sanctions, many struggle to earn enough to feed their families. Economic pressure, coupled with the growing uncertainty over when vaccines will be widely available in the Islamic Republic, have many simply giving up on social distancing, considering it an unaffordable luxury. That has public health officials worried the worst of the pandemic still may be yet to come.""I cannot stop working,"" said Mostafa Shahni, a worried 34-year-old construction worker in Tehran. ""If I do, I can't bring home bread for my wife and two kids.""Iran is now reporting its highest-ever new coronavirus case numbers - more than 25,000 a day. Its daily death toll has surged to around 400, still below the grim record of 486 it reached in November.During the peak of Iran's last surge, around 20,000 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across the country. Today, that figure has topped 40,000. The health ministry warns the number will climb to 60,000 in the coming weeks. Iran remains among the hardest-hit countries in the world and the worst-hit in the Middle East.Across Tehran, Associated Press journalists have seen signs of the pandemic's toll.At Tehran's Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, orderlies pushed the bodies of two victims of the coronavirus across a parking lot to its morgue, one wrapped in white, the other in a black body bag. All of its wards on five floors of the hospital are reserved for coronavirus patients. One empty gurney held a bouquet of roses left for a recently deceased man. A heart-shaped balloon hovered over a still respirator.At the massive Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, already reeling from the pandemic, workers laid cinder-block rows of new graves. Mourners in black wept at a stream of funerals. Officials plan to open a new morgue at the site to handle the wave of death, much wrought by what Iranians simply call ""corona.""Saeed Khal, the director of Tehran's main cemetery, said workers buried 350 bodies there on Tuesday alone - at least 150 had died of coronavirus. The cemetery had never processed that many burials in a single day, not even during Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s that saw 1 million people killed.It was ""one of the hardest and saddest days for my colleagues in the half-century-history of the cemetery,"" Khal told state TV.So much is the influx that some burials are being delayed by a day, unusual for Iran which follows the Islamic practice of immediately burying the dead.Outside the gates of Tehran's Imam Khomeini Hospital complex, where the capital's poor can receive free treatment at its 1,300 beds, scores crowded around one recent day as guards turned away routine cases and allowed in only test-confirmed coronavirus cases.""They say the wards are full of corona patients,"" said Manijeh Taheri, who sought a regular thyroid treatment for her mother at the hospital. ""I have no idea where to take her when such a huge complex has no place for my mother.""Field hospitals are being prepared in Tehran and other major cities. State TV has shown images at hospitals outside the capital with patients being treated in hallways.""We are not going out of the red zone any time soon,"" Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi told state media.President Hassan Rouhani blames the current surge on the fast-spreading variant of the virus first found in Britain, which the government says arrived from neighboring Iraq. Travel between the countries has been restricted since March, though people and commerce continue to cross each day. Overall, Iran has seen 2.2 million reported cases and 67,000 deaths in total.Lawmaker Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi blamed government mismanagement and continued US sanctions for the virus' spread.""Sanctions, challenges and wrong decisions will continue. We do not have sufficient vaccines so protect yourself and your relatives through personal health measures,"" he wrote on Twitter.As of now, Iran has administered over 500,000 vaccine doses, according to the WHO. Supplies, however, remain limited. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned US and British-made coronavirus vaccines, saying their import is ""forbidden"" because he does not trust those nations. Khamenei has approved the import of vaccines from ""safe"" countries, such as China and Russia, and has backed national efforts to produce a homegrown vaccine with help from Cuba.But officials keep changing when they say the wider public will be vaccinated as it remains unclear when Tehran will have a promised 60 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.Amir Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University, said that over the past year, Iran's leadership could point to superpowers like the U.S. struggling to contain the virus. With vaccines rolled out in the West and economies reopening, this could become much more difficult to do, he said.""Ultimately Iran is not self-sufficient when it comes to Covid-19 vaccine development, and it doesn't have the (intensive care unit) beds to absorb the patients it needs to so it really needs external help,"" Afkhami said.Authorities across Iran have closed mosques, restaurants and parks during Ramadan, the Islamic holy fasting month being observed by Muslims around the world. An evening curfew for private cars is in place and travel between cities is banned. Parliament has been suspended for two weeks.But the wider fatigue from the virus has seen people ignore warnings and host fast-breaking meals known as iftars indoors. Already, authorities blamed celebrations around the Iranian New Year known as Nowruz in March for contributing to this wave.Masoud Mardani, an infectious disease specialist on Iran's Covid-19 national task force, has demanded a public curfew. But none so far has come."
79,Registration for Covid vaccination on CoWIN for those above 18 to begin from April 28,"Registration for vaccination against Covid-19 for all those aged above 18 will begin on the CoWIN platform and Aarogya Setu app from April 28, officials said on Thursday.

The inoculation process and documents to be submitted to get the jab remains the same.

The central government had announced that the vaccination for those above 18 years will begin across the country from May 1 as part of the third phase of the inoculation drive.

Certain modifications, including the age criteria and a few other features, have been done and the CoWIN platform is ready to meet the rising demand as is expected once the vaccination for all is opened up, an official said.

From May 1, the present system of private Covid-19 vaccination centres receiving doses from the government and charging up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist and private hospitals will procure directly from vaccine manufacturers.

According to the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy, Covid-19 vaccination will continue to be free for eligible population groups comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above 45 years of age in government vaccination centres, which receive doses from the government of India.

Vaccine manufacturers would make an advance declaration of the price for 50 per cent supply that would be available to state governments in the open market before May 1.

Based on this price, states, private hospitals, industrial establishments may procure vaccine doses from manufacturers.

Private hospitals would have to procure their supplies of Covid-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent supply earmarked for other than the government of India channel.

“While the Centre has liberalised the vaccination policy, it does not mean that vaccines will be sold in pharmacists or chemist shops in the open market,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had clarified on Wednesday.

The price charged for vaccination by private hospitals would be monitored, he said.

“The present dispensation where private Covid vaccination centres receive doses from the government and can charge up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist,” the Union health ministry said.

Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the government of India and would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open market.

For government of India vaccination centres, the eligible population would be the same, which exists today, that is healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and population above 45 years of age.

For other than the government of India channel, the eligibility would be all adult citizens of the country, the document said.

Vaccination against Covid-19 will continue to be free for eligible population groups in all those government Covid vaccination centres which receive vaccine doses from the central government.

All vaccination (through government of India vaccination centres and other than the government of India channel) will be part of the National Vaccination Programme, will follow all existing guidelines, will be captured on the CoWIN platform along with the stocks and price per vaccination applicable in all vaccination centres, will comply with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) management and reporting, digital vaccination certificate and all other prescribed norms.

The division of vaccine supply, which would mean 50 per cent to the government of India and 50 per cent to other than the government of India channel would be applicable uniformly across for all vaccines manufactured in the country.

However, the fully ready to use imported vaccine would be allowed to be utilised entirely in the other than government of India channel, it said.

The Centre from its share will allocate vaccines to states and union territories based on the criteria of performance (speed of administration, average consumption), extent of infections (number of active Covid-19 cases), the document stated.

Second dose of all existing priority groups i.e. HCWs, FLWs and people aged above 45, wherever it has become due, would be given priority, for which a specific and focused strategy would be communicated to all stakeholders.

This policy would come into effect from May 1 and would be reviewed from time-to-time."

An alumni of the Asian College of Journalism (ACJ) in Chennai, Ashish was a journalist who had worked with various publications over the years, including Times of India, Network 18, and Pune Mirror. In January this year, he joined Newslaundry in Delhi, where his colleagues, although having met him only a few times as they were working from home because of the pandemic, described him as “gentle”, “generous”, and “warm”.

“He joined us in January this year and worked as Assistant Editor. He was very gentle and soft-spoken and he had made a name for himself in the industry. He was in Pune before he joined us, he had just moved to Delhi. I had only met him once in his brief time at Newslaundry but I can say that in his short time with us, he won many friends and admirers,” said Manisha Pande, Executive Editor at Newslaundry.

Mehraj D Lone, Senior Editor at Newslaundry said, “He was very intelligent and talented, but as a person also he was always generous, always joking with people, very lively.”

Leaders across party lines, including the Prime Minister as well as the President of India, put out messages on social media to express condolences after hearing of Ashish’s death.

“Condolences to Shri Sitaram Yechury Ji and his family on the tragic and untimely demise of his son, Ashish. On Shanti,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday morning.

80,Australia to reduce flights from India among other high-risk COVID-19 countries,"Earlier on Thursday, Western Australian (WA) Premier Mark McGowan sought travel suspension from India after an outbreak in a quarantine hotel in Perth. (File Photo/Representational)

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced a reduction in flights from high-risk COVID-19 nations, like India, following an alarming rise in coronavirus cases across the world.

After a national Cabinet meeting in Canberra, Morrison said: “What we have agreed to — and this particularly relates to the chartered services we’re running into the Northern Territory — we will be reducing by some 30 per cent the numbers coming through our chartered services in the months ahead.”

While the list of high-risk countries was still being finalised, Morrison said the announcement was made keeping in view India’s worsening second wave of the coronavirus. India registered over 3.14 lakh new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest-ever single-day count recorded in any country, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases in the country to 1,59,30,965.

“We will also be limiting the departure exceptions for Australians travelling to high-risk countries to India. As time goes on, and the pandemic continues to rage, there are countries that are frankly of greater risk than others,” Morrison said.

“The Chief Medical Officer, working with others and the DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade), will be seeking to put a list of high-risk countries in place,” he said, adding that the list would be similar to that of the UK’s COVID-19 travel “red list”.

Morrison further said new rules to return to Australia would now be applied for those coming from such high-risk nations.

“If you have been in a high-risk country in the previous 14 days, before getting on your last point of embarkation to Australia, then you would need to have had a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test 72 hours before leaving that last point of embarkation,” Morrison said.

Morrison said these new steps reflect that this is a global pandemic which is raging.

Australians are living like few others anywhere else in the world. We take those border arrangements very seriously. This is a way of matching that risk, the prime minister said, explaining how strict border controls has led to fewer cases in Australia.

“We have been working hard to get Australians home, particularly since last September. And there will continue to be the opportunity for those to return from places like India, but in very controlled circumstances,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, Western Australian (WA) Premier Mark McGowan sought travel suspension from India after an outbreak in a quarantine hotel in Perth.

McGowan said on April 3, a family of three returned to Perth from the UK and on April 10, a couple returned from India and tested positive for COVID-19 a few days later.

Gowan said genome sequencing linked the strain the two families were now suffering from. He said somehow there was transmission between two rooms with closed doors.

There were another 18 guests on that floor at the time of transmission.

Since the 10th of April, there have been 13 security guards, 31 various hotel staff, one doctor, and two CCTV installers, on that floor. All of these people will be re-tested as soon as possible,” he said. Health authorities are investigating how the transmission occurred.

The coronavirus has so far claimed 910 lives, along with 29,603 confirmed infections, in Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University."

The UAE has banned travel from India for 10 days from Sunday due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in the country, according to media reports here on Thursday.

The travel ban will come into effect from 11.59 pm on Saturday, April 24, and is subject to review after 10 days, the Gulf News reported.

Passengers who have transited through India in the last 14 days are also not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE, the report said.

However, departure flights will continue to operate, it added.

UAE citizens, diplomatic passport holders and official delegations are exempted from the above conditions, it said.

According to Khaleej Times, people are barred from booking flights from the UAE to Indian destinations after April 24 on the Emirates, Etihad, flydubai and Air Arabia websites.

The UAE is the latest country to impose a travel ban on passengers from India after it recorded the world’s highest daily tally of 314,835 new COVID-19 infections on Thursday."
81,Maharashtra allocated only 50% of daily Remdesivir requirement: state health minister,"Remdesivir is listed for use in serious COVID-19 patients. (File Photo)

Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said the state is being allocated 26,000 Remdesivir injections per day by the Centre as against the requirement of 50,000 vials of the anti-COVID-19 drug.

Talking to reporters in Mumbai, Tope said he will write to the Centre to increase the allocation of Remdesivir to Maharashtra, the worst COVID-19-hit state in the country.

“The state government’s daily requirement is 50,000 Remdesivir injections, but the Centre’s allocation is 26,000 injections per day. This is for the next 10 days, which is very serious as timely use of the injections to treat co-morbid and serious COVID-19 patients can save lives,” he said.

Remdesivir is listed for use in serious COVID-19 patients. In view of a sudden spike in demand of the drug due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, the Centre last week banned its export till the situation improves.

“I will send a letter to the Union Health Ministry on Thursday to increase the allocation of the key anti-viral drug to Maharashtra,” the minister said.

Tope and state Food and Drug Administration minister Rajendra Shingane few days ago had assured that the supply of Remdesivir will increase from April 21.

On Wednesday, the state reported 67,468 fresh coronavirus cases, taking its tally beyond the 40-lakh mark, while 568 more patients succumbed to the infection, as per the health department.

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday came down heavily on the Maharashtra government for its “extremely callous” behaviour towards the issue of procuring and allocating Remdesivir injections for COVID-19 patients, and said the authorities are shirking their responsibilities."
84,"Arrangements in place for uninterrupted supply of oxygen, medicines: Haryana CM","Arrangements in place for uninterrupted oxygen supply: Lal

Amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal on Thursday said adequate arrangements have been made in the State to ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen, medicines and other facilities.

Mr. Lal said the government has decided to close shops across the State dealing in non-essential items from 6 p.m. from April 23 onwards.

Responding to question regarding shortage of oxygen supply, Mr. Lalsaid though some difficulty regarding the same was reported but now the problem has been resolved. “I have even held a detailed discussion with PM Modi on this issue. A roster has been made for the filling of oxygen cylinders and then loading these in the trucks from Panipat Oxygen Plant. From now on, one truck will be loaded for Haryana and one each for Delhi and Punjab,” he said.

The Chief Minister said 170 MT of oxygen was supplied to Delhi from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. on Thursday (April 22) from the Panipat plant. “CM Arvind Kejriwal had expressed satisfaction for the supply of oxygen,” said Mr. Lal.

He added that the Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT of oxygen per day, of which 140 is supplied to Delhi, 80 to Haryana and 20 to Punjab. He said Haryana also supplied 20 MT of oxygen from Bhiwadi plant in Rajasthan.

On the current status of availability of beds with ventilators for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals, the Chief Minister said that the facility of availability of beds has been made online in Gurugram and Faridabad districts. Mr. Lal said 1,000 Remdesivir injections were supplied in government hospitals till April 21 and the supply will be further increased."
84,"Safer policing: None over 58 on PCR van duty, only virtual meets","With the Covid-19 pandemic further tightening its grip on the national capital, the Delhi Police on Thursday removed all personnel aged 58 years and above from the police control room (PCR) van duty, besides advising all station personnel to have only virtual interactions with the public. The force’s in-house meetings are now being held in open spaces within police stations, officers aware of the developments said.Over 8,000 police personnel have tested positive for the virus and 38 have succumbed since the beginning of the pandemic. At least 432 personnel have contracted Covid-19 until Thursday since the current wave of infections started.Given that one in every three people who get tested for the coronavirus disease are turning positive in Delhi, and in view of the week-long curfew to contain the virus spread, police personnel are now acting as frontline workers. They are managing containment zones, enforcing curfew norms , arranging oxygen cylinders and rushing Covid-19 patients to hospitals, apart from maintaining law and order.A senior police officer said, “For now, we have ordered that all persons aged 58 years and above should not be posted on PCR van duty. Compared to other units, the personnel with PCR vans are testing positive for the disease more. The PCR van is the first responder at every spot -- its personnel visit homes when people call 112.”After a meeting of the police brass on Saturday, all personnel were told to keep sufficient stock of PPE kits because police vehicles are also doubling up as ambulances. The 112 number (police control room) is getting over 150 calls requesting ambulances. In the past 48 hours, there were six cases of police vans rushing Covid-19 patients to the hospitals.A station house officer of a south Delhi police station said, “Our meetings with complainants are virtual now. This is being adopted by other police stations, too, and it is safer for complainants as well. All they have to do is to inform one of our designated officer at the station gate. They will get a time and phone number for the video call.This is better than visiting the station, which is a closed space. In-house meetings are now being held on the lawns.”A second senior police officer said that, at the New Friends Colony police station in south-east Delhi, tents have been erected outside the station for visitors. “There is an audio-video system at the gate for the visitor to connect with the station. Every paper (copies of complaints brought by visitors) is disinfected before it is taken inside or handed back to the visitor. Apart from PPE kits, we have also given our personnel, protective eye gear that health care professionals use to shield themselves from the virus,” the second officer said.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said police stations across the city are “adopting different measures to remain safe on the job”."
84,"With Delhi’s health-care system stretched thin, tele consultation services hit","With the health-care system in the national capital overwhelmed by the tsunami of Covid-19 cases, tele consultations services of most hospitals have also taken a hit.Many in home isolation complained of unavailability of slots and delayed response time from overburdened doctors, even as beds for Covid-19 patients remained in short supply.Mahant Ahuja, a resident of Alaknanda who was tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, said, “I had very mild symptoms -- slight fever, cough, and sore throat -- during the first two days. We cannot go to hospitals directly in the present situation and that’s why I tried to book an appointment for a virtual consultation. But it took me two days to reach a doctor. I was told that slots were few due to the unavailability of doctors. I am grateful that my condition did not deteriorate in the meantime but the situation is scary for those having moderate to severe symptoms.”Several other Covid-19 patients are facing similar issues. Anamika Kapur, a resident of Green Park, said she placed a request for online consultation with a private hospital for her Covid positive mother on Sunday and did not get a response even after three days. “My mother’s oxygen saturation dropped to 70 (from an optimum of 95%) in that time. Finally, we had to contact a general physician providing telemedicine services in my locality to start her treatment on Tuesday,” she said.Several hospitals and tele consultation services acknowledged that the facility has been hit by the raging pandemic. Dr Alexander Kuruvilla, chief health strategy officer on digital health app ‘Practo’, said the number of requests for tele consultation has increased by five times in the last 20 days.“The spike was mainly for general medicine . There are complaints of unavailability of slots as doctors on board with us are not available -- they are stretched by the existing situation. It was challenging for us to respond to the sudden surge and it takes time to get more doctors on board. The situation is getting better now and it will further improve in the coming days,” he said.Officials at a few private hospitals said they will have to step up measures to meet the increasing demand for over-the-phone consultations. Prashant Singh, Director IT, and CIO at Max Healthcare said the number of patients reaching out for tele consultations has surpassed the number of patients seeking in-person consultations. “Our doctors are fully occupied with Covid patients right now but we do not have any other option other than tele consultations in the present scenario. We have reduced the timing of each slot so that doctors can attend to more patients,” he said.An official at the tele consultation department at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Dwarka said they have prepared roasters for doctors to divide their time between in-person and tele consultations. “We are trying to connect patients with available doctors on the same day itself. But our doctors are occupied with Covid patients and a few even have Covid cases at home,” said the official.Meanwhile, independent practitioners are also flooded with tele consultation requests. Dr Rachna Kucheria, a general physician in South Delhi, said, “The number of calls I am getting are unprecedented and 98% of those who call have Covid symptoms. Besides Covid-related queries, I am also getting calls requesting beds and oxygen,” she said.Kucheria, founder of DocGenie Telemedicine, said it is important to strengthen tele consultation services to take the load off the health-care system. “It’s time to pool together general physicians at the community level to step up tele consultation services. It’s very challenging for doctors to manage hospital patients and telemedicine consults both,” she said."
85,Delhi’s health infra on brink of collapse,"At 9pm on Thursday, there were a mere 15 ICU beds – of them only four with ventilators – remaining for Covid-19 patients in India’s national capital, the Delhi government’s hospital resource reporting app showed. The vacant beds accounted for 0.32% of the 4,663 ICU beds for Of the 20,443 regular hospital beds for people with the coronavirus, only 10.5% -- or 2,141 – were available at the same time on Thursday.These numbers illustrate the near-collapse of the health infrastructure under the burden of a record number of infections. While these numbers are dependent on how frequently and accurately hospital staff updates them, HT’s monitoring of the Delhi Corona website showed vacanacies at hospitals have significantly dropped in the past two days.In the case of ICU beds, there was a peak of 34 vacancies that was reported on Wednesday morning before the number dropped soon after. For most of Thursday, there were fewer than The number of vacant beds has followed a clearer fall, dropping from roughly 2,700 available on Tuesday evening to a little over 2,100 late on Thursday.As on Thursday, there were 91,618 active cases in Delhi – the first time this number was above the 90,000 mark. The city added 26,169 new cases in the past 24 hours and recorded 306 more fatalities.Experts say the numbers capture a crisis that has been unfolding for several weeks now and could drive up mortality as lives that can be saved with medical attention are lost.“The situation in Delhi is very bad; it is turning out to be a Brazil-like situation. People are going from hospital to hospital for the want of beds. When hospitals are full and we can’t take care of patients, the number of deaths will go up. I believe they have set up a system in Maharashtra where a centralised helpline takes patients information such as name, age, oxygen saturation, reports of X-ray or CT scans and direct people to hospitals accordingly. There should be a similar system in Delhi,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.A doctor from one of Delhi’s big private hospitals, which is finding it difficult to refer patients out of its emergency department, too, said a centralised system was needed to cut down on the number of deaths.“Every day there are patients who are brought dead to our emergency department. They have been going from hospital to hospital looking for beds. We lose patients because they are lying on the floor instead of the ICU they need. We have more patients than we have oxygen points. A solution would be for the government to take stock of the number of beds across the city and refer patients wherever beds are available. Hospitals such as the one built by the army should be meant for such referral patients,” the doctor said, asking not to be named.“So far, there was hardly any difference in the mortality during this wave and the previous one, proving that the virus is not more fatal. However, the deaths may be higher now because the health system has been overburdened. And, we keep on adding more cases every day for which we need to add more infrastructure every day,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The situation could ease by a small degree later this week as the Union government decided to revive the Covid-19 case facility in Chattarpur, which will have 500 beds with oxygen support to begin with.The facility, set up during the waves of infection recorded last year, was closed on February 23 when the outbreak appeared to have receded. It is now expected to be opened in three days’ time with the Indo-Tibet Border Police managing operations.“Delhi government has assured us they will set-up the infrastructure in maximum three days and hand over the facility to us. Our team of doctors and paramedics is ready. It will be operational in two-three days,” director general of ITBP, SS Deswal, told HT.The facility, named Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, is at the Radha Soami Beas grounds.“The Delhi government had sought medical officers and para-medical staff from the ministry of home affairs to man the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Chhattarpur, which is being re-operationalised. The Ministry of Home Affairs has designated ITBP as the nodal force for operating the facility,” a home ministry spokesperson said.“It has been decided to provide an adequate number of medical officers and para-medical staff to man 500 oxygenated beds to Sardar Patel Covid centre, Chhattarpur in Delhi,” said an MHA letter reviewed by HT.An officer, who didn’t want to be named, said they are hoping to increase the number of beds to 1,500 by the first week of May."
85,Hospitals in Delhi scrape bottom of barrel as oxygen supplies run out,"More hospitals continued to sound the alarm about their dwindling oxygen supply, with some having run out and switching to  while others moving patients to other facilities in other towns before their stocks ran out.At least 15 hospitals across the city had less than five hours of oxygen on Thursday, according to figures compiled by the , which kept going back-and-forth with the Centre and neighbouring states to ensure supply.On Thursday morning, HT received an SOS from Saroj hospital in Rohini, which was to run out of its liquid medical oxygen by 10:30 am – which is did. For the next four and a half hours, the hospital plugged oxygen cylinders to their supply lines so that the 140 Covid-19 patients at the facility could be given the required respiratory support.“We have been managing patients with reserve oxygen cylinders, refilling them and using them again. We need liquid medical oxygen,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj Hospital. The hospital had to stop new admissions and discharge some stable patients. Oxygen replenishments reached the facility at around 3pm.After Max group, Saroj became the second to move court to ensure timely oxygen supply, following which the Delhi high court issued new orders to ensure supplies are made smoothly.The situation was similar at Karkardooma’s which put up a message stating, “we regret we are stopping admission in the hospital because oxygen supply is not coming.”With increased oxygen demand, the hospital had been simultaneously using liquid medical oxygen, oxygen cylinders, and a concentrator plant. This left the hospital with hardly any backup.The doctors in the hospital urged patients to leave and look for other hospitals that might take them in. However, with less than 20 ICU beds available and hardly any oxygen beds, they had nowhere to go.“We discharged seven patients; the others said we will die on the road anyway, it is better to wait here. This is a horrifying situation, I have never seen anything like this in 45 years of my career,” said Dr Sunil Sagar, CEO, Shanti Mukand Hospital.The hospital last received half its required supply of liquid medical oxygen at 02:30 am after a delay of three hours. “My staff was standing outside waiting for the oxygen tanker. Every time there was some movement on the road, they thought it was the tanker,” he said. The hospital turned down oxygen to its patients to conserve whatever it could till the oxygen arrived. The hospital received supply just in time after having dipped into reserves.Metro hospital in Preet Vihar, which had over 100 Covid-19 patients admitted, had to start moving them to its other centres in Shadipur, Noida and Faridabad after it completely ran out of oxygen. The hospital last received half its supply of medical oxygen on Wednesday night. It has been managing by refilling oxygen cylinders since Thursday afternoon.The crisis has been precipitated by obstruction of supply tankers from Haryana coming to Delhi on Wednesday, which resulted in a critical situation on Thursday, according to a doctor in know of the matter.“The oxygen reserves at most hospitals are running low because of the increased demand – hospitals are accommodating more patients than usual and almost all the patients need a lot of oxygen. Most hospitals had around 8 to 10 hours of back-up and would receive supply in time. The situation got worse on Wednesday because of several tankers being stopped by the Haryana government. It was a domino effect that delayed supply to all hospital. This resulted in hospitals having almost no reserves on Thursday,” the doctor said.He added, “It has become like a game of musical chair – the oxygen tankers are being diverted to whichever hospital is running out of oxygen. This means, the hospital that was to receive the oxygen also goes into a crisis,” the doctor said.The Delhi government estimated that the city would need around 700 MT of oxygen a day due to the increase in the number of patients with Covid-19. On Wednesday, the Centre increased Delhi’s quota of medical oxygen to 480 MT from 378 MT.Yet, tankers of oxygen that were meant for Delhi hospitals were stopped by administrations from neighbouring states, officials said. “Despite the quota being increased by the Centre, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments are stopping oxygen supply to Delhi. Yesterday, Delhi received 177 MT of oxygen against its quota of 378 MT. I urge the Centre to ensure oxygen reaches us even if paramilitary force needs to be deputed,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a tweet on Thursday evening.The Ministry of Home Affairs had to intervene and order all states to ensure allotted quota of oxygen be allowed to be supplied to states other than where the medical oxygen plants are located.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too said that he spoke to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Centre to facilitate the passage of oxygen. Of the extended quota of oxygen, majority is from Orissa that might take days to arrive, Kejriwal said, adding that he had a word with the state’s chief minister Naveen Patnaik to facilitate “lifting of Delhi’s quota of oxygen” from the state.Holy family hospital too received its supply of liquid medical oxygen minutes before its stock would have run out. “We already had all of our staff scrambling to gather oxygen cylinders and attaching it to the manifold in case the oxygen runs out. We have attached 35 cylinders and are waiting with bated breaths,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of the hospital. The hospital received its supply.Aakash hospital had just 1.5 hours of medical supply when it desperately reached out to authorities on Twitter. “We have 233 Covid-19 patients admitted with, of which 75 are dependent on oxygen. My whole team is running around but we have no assurance so far,” said Dr Kausar Shah, COO, Aakash group. The hospital managed to get 50 oxygen cylinders from neighbouring hospitals and half a tanker of oxygen just in the nick of time.Action Balaji hospital also raised an alarm when they had about three to four hours of supply. Again they received a tanker of oxygen only after dipping into their reserves, which is like going beyond the red line on a fuel tank.Even Delhi government hospitals weren’t spared of problems, with Rajiv Gandhi superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur receiving its supply of medical oxygen just 30 minutes before it was to run out. The hospital has nearly 500 Covid-19 patients.At night, Sir Ganga Ram hospital again raised an alarm that it had oxygen left for five hours of normal use, meaning lesser time if high flow oxygen is given to Covid-19 patients. The hospital currently has over 500 Covid-19 patients admitted."
85,Nightmare at noon: Patients die gasping for air at Delhi hospital,"Around noon on Thursday, a 44-year-old woman lay on a stretcher outside GTB Hospital in East Delhi, gasping for breath. Her husband and daughter pleaded with the guards to allow her to be taken to the emergency ward so she could be given her oxygen.

As precious minutes passed, the woman’s breathing became more laboured. After more than an hour, she was finally wheeled in. A few minutes later, her husband and daughter walked out with her body on the same stretcher.

As the macabre crisis of oxygen shortage, overstretched resources, and overworked healthcare workers continued unabated in Delhi, families and friends ran from pillar to post to get their loved ones into hospitals, mostly without success.

“She had a cough and cold for the last few days. She started to have breathing problems last evening, after which our family doctor prescribed some medicines and she slept well,” said 50-year-old K P Singh, brother-in-law of the woman who died at GTB.

“But this morning, the problem started again, and we brought her to the hospital.” The family said even after they managed to get in, no oxygen could be given to her.

As Delhi has detected 25,000 new cases of Covid infection on average daily for the past week, the number of patients needing hospital care has risen sharply. But hospitals have been complaining of an acute shortage of oxygen since Monday — and some have been turning away patients despite having beds only because there is no oxygen to administer to them.

GTB, the second largest Covid facility in the capital after Lok Nayak Hospital, was among the hospitals that sounded an alarm over depleting oxygen stocks on Wednesday. They did get some supply, but it was not enough to meet the demand.

At the hospital’s gate on Thursday, security guards pleaded that the emergency unit was understaffed and stretched to breaking point.

There were several cases like that of the woman who died on the stretcher. One family with whom The Indian Express could speak to fleetingly said they had been allowed to go in after a wait of several hours. The patient, who was 53 years old, died around 3 pm.

Shashank Tomar (29), who said he was the patient’s nephew, said his uncle had symptoms of Covid, but they had been unable to get him tested for the virus. “He had fever for two days and shortness of breath since last night. We got him to the hospital today because he needed oxygen support. We wanted to get him tested but that would have taken a few hours, and he was in critical need of oxygen.” He was given oxygen at the hospital, but it was too late by then, Tomar said.

A man who identified himself as Rajyavardhan Singh from Dilshad Colony reached the hospital on a bike with his wife and her 62-year-old father, who had difficulty breathing. They had made rounds of a number of clinics, including Jyoti Nursing Home and Kapoor Medical Centre, since the morning, but had failed to get admission, Singh said.

At GTB, Singh’s father-in-law collapsed on the ground, after which a ward boy called them inside so that he could be put on oxygen support. Singh said he had been tested for Covid, but had not got the result yet.

“We do not know if it is Covid… he started having breathing problems two days ago. He has diabetes. We came here to check if he had Covid, and to get him on oxygen support,” Singh said.

Singh was among many who could not find an ambulance to bring the patient to hospital. Pramod Kumar Sharma (56), who was able to get his younger brother (37) admitted to the emergency unit after a long wait said they had come to the hospital in their own vehicle. Emerging from the emergency ward, he told The Indian Express that oxygen was in short supply, and not everyone was getting it.

Every few minutes, an ambulance, a private vehicle or an auto reached the entrance of the emergency ward. At around 2 pm, a patient who had collapsed in the auto was immediately taken in on a stretcher. A few were admitted to the casualty ward.

Most families who reached the emergency unit did not know if their patient had Covid or not. Patients and their families waited in a line outside the emergency unit and guards struggled to manage the situation. Some patients were on stretchers, others needed the help of a family member to walk.

At 2.55 pm, a fight broke out between a family who had just lost a patient and a doctor. The doctor had arrived for his duty at 3 pm. When the family asked him why he was not inside helping patients at the time, he explained that there was a team of doctors and nurses doing the needful. However, the infuriated family said nobody was present inside to help them when their patient was struggling to survive.

Families also complained that the Corona app showed that there were over 300 vacant beds in the hospital. Yet, very few were being admitted and critical patients with breathing problems were being taken into the emergency ward, where they said they were given little to no care."
85,Tug-of-war for oxygen keeps Delhi on brink,"Several hospitals in the national capital issued new distress messages about their dwindling oxygen supply as the crisis continued on Thursday, prompting the Delhi government to hit out at what it described as “jungle raj” by neighbouring states of The Union government, too, made new interventions, invoking the Disaster Management Act to remind all states that anyone restricting supplies will face punitive action under the law, while the Delhi Disaster Management Authority appointed two senior bureaucrats as nodal officers to ensure smooth movement of tankers and directed the Delhi Police to provide security logistics from manufacturers’ sites to various health facilities.Throughout Thursday, however, hospitals continued to issue SOS messages saying they were short on supply, with some blaming states for supplies being halted there. “This jungle raj has been going on for three days,” said Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, referring to the alleged blockades by the police forces of the two neighbouring states.“Some hospitals in Delhi have run out of oxygen completely. They don’t have any option available. I have been receiving calls, messages, e-mails. We have been making internal, makeshift arrangements, but this cannot continue for long,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, spoke on the , asking states to come down heavily on hoarding and fix responsibility with local administration in cases of obstruction. He told officials to ensure a “smooth, unhindered” supply of oxygen to various states at a review meeting on Thursday.The problem came into focus early on Tuesday when several hospitals in the Capital said they were on the verge of supplies running out, which would end oxygen support to critically ill patients. The problem recurred on Wednesday and Thursday, with close to 1,000 patients being in danger on both days.On Thursday, multiple hospitals -- including Sir Ganga Ram, Saroj, Holy Family, Aakash, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty — said they had either run out of their liquid medical oxygen and had switched to back-up cylinders, or were soon in danger of running out. Some even discharged patients and asked them to go to other facilities.“Our officials and even the Central government officials have tried to talk to officials in these states, but the situation on the ground has not changed. Our tankers are still waiting outside the plants. In the plants located in Haryana, only tankers from that state are being allowed to go in for refilling,” said Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 in Delhi.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal later raised the issue with his Haryana counterpart.The Union government increased Delhi’s quota of daily oxygen supply from 378MT to 480MT on Wednesday, but officials said even this may not be adequate and the additional capacity was likely to take time to arrive.“The Centre decides the companies from which we get oxygen. The revised quota that the Centre has allotted to us, a substantial part of it is to come from Odisha. But it will take several days to bring by road. We are exploring if bringing oxygen from there by air is possible. We are trying for that,” Kejriwal said.A government spokesperson said supplies may reach the city too late. “What remains a matter of grave concern is that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 MT oxygen from Odisha (70 MT) and West Bengal (30 MT) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. Our citizens, our hospitals, our city are running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140-metric tonne which Haryana has to supply is yet to leave for Delhi,” said the spokesperson.On Friday, PM Modi is also scheduled to meet chief ministers of regions with a high Covid-19 burden."
85,‘6 hospitals ran out of oxygen’,"U.P. and Haryana governments trying to hoard oxygen: Sisodia

At least six private hospitals treating COVID-19 patients ran out of liquid medical oxygen on Thursday, as per the Delhi government, with several hospitals stating during the day that they had dangerously low levels of oxygen.

Many hospitals said that they arranged oxygen cylinders to manage the shortage, while some had to ask patients to shift to somewhere else.

Oxygen supply to hospitals in Delhi has been a problem for the past five days and the Delhi government has been blaming U.P. and Haryana governments for disrupting supply from private companies to Delhi.

The quota of oxygen for each State is decided by the Centre and in case of Delhi, it comes mostly from private oxygen plants in other States.

On Wednesday as well, several hospitals complained of dangerously low stocks of oxygen.

On Thursday, accusing the Haryana and U.P. governments of stalling the supply of oxygen to the Capital, Mr. Sisodia asked the Centre to deploy paramilitary personnel.

He said that Delhi was not getting the full quota of oxygen from a plant in Haryana as district officials were stopping trucks coming from Delhi for liquid medical oxygen.

Jungle raj

“In some time, without adequate oxygen supply, it may become difficult for Delhi hospitals to save lives of patients. We cannot keep on going on with this makeshift arrangement. It is my request to the Central government that even if you have to deploy paramilitary forces to ensure trucks from all States are replenishing oxygen without any hindrances from officials from other State governments, please do so. The way U.P. and Haryana governments are trying to monopolise and hoard oxygen, they have created a jungle raj”, which is very dangerous for everyone,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Later, in a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Mr. Sisodia said that six private hospitals have exhausted the stock of oxygen. The hospitals were Rathi Hospital, Santom Hospital, Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Shanti Mukand Hospital, Tirath Ram Shah Hospital, and UK Nursing home, as per the letter.

Mr. Sisodia urged the Union Minister to intervene to save people’s lives and make sure that Delhi gets its quota of oxygen from other States."
86,AAD writes to DU V-C over in-house care centre,"The Academics for Action and Development on Thursday wrote to Delhi University V-C P.C. Joshi demanding an in-house COVID Care Centre in view of the surging cases.

“Presently, the situation has become very difficult and it takes time in arranging a hospital bed. This leads to loss of precious time for a patient and in-house facility can provide some cushion. In this direction, we can have dialogue with the Delhi government, DRDO and other departments or agencies concerned. We have a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with DRDO,” it read.

Referring to a previous letter written to authorities on the same issue, the AAD said, “In our earlier mails, we have suggested you to attach the university guest houses WUS Health Centres and develop the facilities for COVID-infected university employees. Efforts should be made to develop some beds with level 3 facility, if not more than that.”"

The narrow lane is otherwise empty, more or less — it goes past Jama Masjid’s gate no. 2, in Old Delhi. The entrance to the mosque is locked. The popular tea stall nearby is closed. But then the city is under curfew due to the pandemic. The only people to be seen are a few families sleeping on the pavement — they’ve been living here for years. The only other living being around is a brown dog snoozing on a manhole.Now a rickshaw puller enters the scene. He stops his carriage in front of the twin Sufi shrines of Hazrat Sarmad Shahid and Hazrat Hare Bhare Shah, which stand in front of the Mughal-era mosque. The puller is wearing a check lungi, his head covered in a white gamcha. The shrine’s door is open and, inside, a rose seller is perched on his stall. But the puller doesn’t seem like he wants to enter the dargah. He gets off the rickshaw, stands in front of the marble screen of the shrine, and raises his arm as if in supplication. He closes his eyes, his lips moving soundlessly. The man stays in this posture for about five minutes — each passing second feels like a sea wave, coming quickly and receding the next moment, its impact lingering on.The lips finally stop moving. The eyes open. The palms reverently touch the forehead.

He means the coronavirus.Has he got symptoms?He shakes his head again. “I was praying for all of us.”Reluctant to give away his name, he excuses himself politely, sits back on his seat and pedals away towards Urdu Bazaar.

86,Sisodia seeks Centre’s help as Capital chokes,"Kejriwal calls on counterparts in other States for united fight against the pandemic

At least half a dozen hospitals ran out of oxygen in Delhi even as others struggled with depleting supply across the National Capital Region (NCR) on Thursday.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called on his counterparts in other States for a united front against the pandemic and pledged to share resources at every possible opportunity to do so.

Mr. Kejriwal’s deputy and nodal Minister for COVID management in the city Manish Sisodia asked the Centre to intervene and deploy paramilitary personnel at borders if need be to ensure that the Capital gets its quota of oxygen from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, accusing their governments of interfering in supply.

He wrote a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan stating that six private hospitals had exhausted their stock of oxygen, urging him to intervene to save the lives of people of Delhi and make sure that the city gets its quota of oxygen from other States.

Officials appointed

Fortis Hospital in Haryana’s Gurugram, in a series of distress messages on Thursday evening, said it was left with only 45 minutes of oxygen supply. In Delhi, two IAS officers were appointed to ensure smooth procurement of oxygen tankers from neighbouring States and the police tasked with facilitating movement to medical establishments. Around 1 p.m., Rathi Hospital in Delhi, which has 78 COVID-19 patients, said it had oxygen only for half an hour. Shanti Mukund Hospital pasted a poster on its gate that it is stopping admissions. Another private hospital said around 5 p.m. that it had oxygen only for 90 minutes and had 233 COVID patients.

According to Delhi government estimates, Mr. Kejriwal said, the city required a daily supply of 700 tonnes of oxygen and the Centre had on Wednesday decided to increase the initial quota of 378 tonnes to 480 tonnes.

In his letter to Dr. Vardhan, Mr. Sisodia stated that only one of the seven major government hospitals under the Delhi government had oxygen supply for 24 hours while six of the 15 major private hospitals in the city had exhausted theirs. Others were struggling with little to dangerously low supply of oxygen. The Delhi government, he said, was also mulling airlifting oxygen from Odisha.

The pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal said, was a collective crisis and everyone needed to come together to confront and defeat it. It was time, he said, that governments rose above State divisions and became “Indians”."
87,"Barricades on one side of highway at Singhu border will be removed to create passage for services, say farmers"," Farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders announced on Thursday that barricades on one side of the highway at Singhu border will be removed for easier passage of services. The decision was taken following a meeting with Haryana government officials, the farmers’ union said.In a statement released Thursday, Samyukta Kisan Morcha -- the umbrella group with 40 farmer unions running the agitation -- said it did not want to cause inconvenience to people.“Leaders of Samyukt Kisan Morcha had a detailed meeting with officials of the Haryana government this evening. In the meeting, it was decided that barricades on one side of the highway at Singhu border will be removed, to give free passage to oxygen tankers, ambulance and other such emergency services,” farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The comments came in the backdrop of several allegations on social media this week that the road blockades on account of farmer agitation were leading to a delay in the movement of oxygen tankers across the state borders. BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh tweeted on Tuesday night that due to the road blockade by protesters at the Ghazipur border, oxygen suppliers were facing difficulties in bringing the tankers to Delhi.“... It is the government that is to be squarely blamed for barricading the roads and obstructing free passage, whereas, at all protest sites, farmers have already left such passage for vehicular movement,” SKM said in a statement.The protesting farmers, however, on Thursday showed no signs of calling off the agitation. “A large convoy of protesters in tractor-trolleys will be leaving from Barwasni in Sonepat district of Haryana for the Singhu Border,” SKM said, adding that this was to ensure that government did not try to remove the farmers on the “pretext” of the Covid-19 surge."
87,"NGO seeks ration, food for those without card","Case likely to be heard in HC today

The Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan has approached the Delhi High Court seeking immediate provision of rations and cooked food to needy persons who do not possess ration cards, in light of the fresh curfew imposed in Delhi to curtail the spread of COVID-19.

“The lockdown has resulted in loss of livelihoods, which is causing intense financial distress and food insecurity among the economically weaker sections, especially daily wagers, domestic workers, construction labourers, homeless persons and residents of slum settlements,” the NGO said.

“The distress can be gauged from the thousands of people turning up at the homeless shelters in Yamuna Pushta area seeking food. In the absence of requisite measures, many are being turned away without any provision of food,” it said.

The plea has sought provision of dry rations for people who do not possess ration cards, either through resumption of Mukhya Mantri Corona Sahayata Yojna or any other scheme.

It also asked for free cooked meals through all homeless shelters and through hunger relief centres set up for the purpose and ensure no one desirous of food is turned away without food.

Only 37% of the population of Delhi possesses ration cards, the NGO said. The case is likely to come up for hearing on Friday."
88,"Number of migrants at ISBT, railway stns down","New Delhi: The number of migrants at bus stands and railway stations in the capital was much lesser till 6pm on Thursday as compared to previous days. Senior officials told TOI they were prepared to tackle any possible increased movement over the weekend. Delhi governmentâs task force also held meetings with stakeholders to keep a plan ready to avoid crowding.Dr Punit Sethi, estate manager at Anand Vihar and a member of the task force, said: âFrom Anand Vihar and Kaushambi, approximately 980 buses and 29,400 passengers left between 6pm on Wednesday and 6pm on Thursday. We are regularly getting the toilets cleaned and drinking water is being provided. Coordination with other states is also going on for smooth passage of the migrants.âNot all families at Anand Vihar bus stand were going home because of the lockdown. âCases are rising everyday and we donât know if we will be safe. The lockdown reminds us of the horrors of last year. We would have still stayed back, but our relatives back home are sick and in such times, they need my presence,â said a labourer heading to Badaun.To facilitate the movement of the migrant workers in a smooth manner, a task force was constituted on Wednesday. KK Dahiya, special commissioner of transport, has been made as the nodal officer to make all necessary arrangements and to maintain close liaison with the transport authorities of neighbouring states, particularly in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.âThe task force will render necessary assistance to any person wishing to undertake interstate travel and for that purpose adequate number of helpdesks will also be set up at ISBT ,â stated the order."
88,Stranded labourers on Yamuna banks bank on hope,"With no money or means to go back to their villages, they hope the lockdown is not extended this time

For the hundreds of migrant workers who continue to reside on the banks of the Yamuna, the week-long lockdown imposed by the Delhi government to curb the surge in COVID-19 cases, has been all too similar to conditions, which prevailed exactly a year back – when they were stranded at the same place without work.

Less than five km away from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence, the daily wagers said that the only aid they have received since the lockdown began was from a gurdwara in the vicinity that provided cooked meals twice a day.

Ashok Kumar, who hails from Aligarh, said: “There is no provision of food or shelter for us from the government. We have been surviving on cooked meals provided by volunteers from the gurdwara. They are the only one who look after us and provide us meals. The shelters have become so crowded that it becomes impossible to stay there. So we have no other option, but to idle our time away on the banks of the Yamuna.”

Like Mr. Ashok, 42-year-old Sanjay Kumar, who hails from Uttar Pradesh’s Sitapur district, rued about lack of work in the run-up to the lockdown, which left them without any means to return to their villages.“We are engaged in work that involves weddings. That is our main source of income. But due to this virus, that industry has been badly affected and most weddings are held adhering to restrictions. We have not been able to earn much in the last few months. So how can we even think of buying tickets and returning?,” said Mr. Kumar.

While most are aware of the COVID-19 protocols, which are required to be followed, the workers complained that no provisions were made to distribute masks among them.

When found without a mask, Raju Singh, from Bihar’s Samastipur district, said: “We are daily wagers. If I have no earning, how am I supposed to buy masks and sanitisers? Some have managed to get a few masks, but there has been no proper distribution that I have seen since the time I have been here. I reached Delhi a month back in search of work. While last year I had returned during the lockdown period, this time I could not arrange enough money for the tickets.”

The workers are just hoping that this lockdown is not extended like earlier.

Hari Mohan, from Odisha’s Mayubhanj district, said, “The government said that things will open up in a week. That is our only hope at the moment. We don’t have enough means to go back. We hope that the lockdown is not extended.”"
89,Delhi Court dismisses plea seeking handcuffs for Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi,"The court noted that ​both the accused have already been granted bail in the case pending before it, and the other matter was pending before some other judge.

A court here on Thursday dismissed the applications seeking to produce former JNU student Umar Khalid and activist Khalid Saifi, arrested in connection with the last years northeast Delhi riots, before it in “handcuffs"" and sought explanation from the DCPs concerned of Delhi police for moving such plea.

The court noted that the applications were filed by Incharge, Lock-Up, Karkardooma District Courts, reportedly after “a decision was taken in the matter by so called senior police officers of Delhi Police to move such applications before the Court”.

The applications, which came up for hearing before Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, sought to produce both the accused in “handcuffs in both hands from back side”, contending that they are “high-risk prisoners”.

During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Manoj Chaudhary was asked about the meaning of “high-risk prisoner” and that where the same has been defined; whether in the jail manual or Punjab Police Rules or the circular(s) issued by Delhi Police. The SPP, however, submitted that he was not aware of the instant applications and, therefore, he could not take instructions in the matter.

The court noted that ​both the accused have already been granted bail in the case pending before it, and the other matter was pending before some other judge. “It is presumed that the bail order(s) of applicants are in the knowledge of senior police officer(s) of Delhi Police. “The instant applications are completely bereft of the reason(s), prompting the senior police officer(s) to take a decision to move such application(s),” the judge said.

He said that “for want of material/reason(s) in respect of the applications in question, this court is at a loss to consider the grant of prayer(s) in these applications.” “​In this view of the matter, let report(s) be called from DCP (Special Cell), who is dealing with the investigation of case FIR No.59/2020, PS Crime Branch (pertaining to criminal conspiracy) and DCP, 3rd BN, DAP (Delhi Armed Police) to communicate the reasons for moving such application(s) before this Court. “The report be also called from Superintendent Jail concerned on these applications.​ Now, renotify the matter for further consideration on May 6,” the judge said. While Saifi was granted bail in the case in November last year, Khalid was granted the relief earlier this month.

The present case was registered on the statement of Constable Sangram Singh, where he stated that on February 24, 2020 at about 2 PM, a large crowd gathered on the road and started pelting stones in which he and other police officials got injured as they were thrashed by the mob.

They set the vehicles in a parking area nearby on fire, including his motorcycle of the complainant was also burnt by the rioters, he said.

The accused, however, are in jail as they were arrested in another case related to the criminal conspiracy, lodged under stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other sections."
89,"Join hands to defeat virus defying State borders, appeals Kejriwal","CM says week-long lockdown being utilised to ramp up medical infrastructure

Terming it a collective crisis, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday appealed to his counterparts in other States to come together to confront and defeat COVID-19 instead of allowing State borders to divide their response to the pandemic.

Addressing a digital briefing, the Chief Minister pledged to provide resources such as oxygen, essential medicines and medical personnel, including doctors, to other States when Delhi is in a position to share them.

“Over the last few days we have witnessed the paucity of oxygen, medicines, vaccination and other resources across the country due to the COVID-19 situation. Delhi has also been facing issues, especially related to oxygen. I have spent nights in attempt to ensure oxygen supply to city hospitals,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Oxygen need

“According to Delhi government estimates, the city requires a daily supply of 700 tonnes of oxygen. The Centre had allocated a quota of 378 tonnes of oxygen to Delhi initially, but has increased that to 480 tonnes on Wednesday for which we are very, very thankful. Though it is lower than what is required, we are thankful,” he also said.

The Centre, Mr. Kejriwal said, also decides which company supplies oxygen to States and cities such as Delhi, where oxygen is not manufactured. Oxygen manufactured by companies in other States is allocated to others according to the Centre’s directions, he said.

Some State governments, Mr. Kejriwal alleged, where such manufacturing units were located, had stopped the transportation of oxygen allocated to Delhi and used it themselves, given the circumstances and paucity of oxygen.

“I want to thank the Centre and the Delhi High Court for helping us with this issue. I, Delhi’s Ministers and officers have not slept for several nights and were in constant touch with the Centre over the issue of oxygen supply,” he said.

“But the increased supply will take some time and we are mulling airlifting oxygen from Odisha. In the meantime, I am personally ensuring that every truck with oxygen reaches its destination. Like I had promised, these six days are being utilised to ramp up our medical infrastructure as much as possible, round the clock,” he also said.

The pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal said, was “a very big emergency” and everyone needed to come together to confront and defeat it.

Instead of watching how supplies of essential resources were stopped by one State from reaching another, people wanted to see how these States were helping each other in this time of need, he said.

“I want to assure you as the Chief Minister of Delhi that I will share my resources with other States as soon as possible. We have to show the world how India, despite having the highest COVID-19 cases in the whole world, came together to fight and defeat this pandemic,” he also said."
90,Green routes to be created for O2 tankers,"New Delhi: With most city hospitals still facing an oxygen crisis , Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked Delhi Police to provide a green corridor for all oxygen tankers from the point of entry to the destination when they arrive from other states. It also deputed senior officers for controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to healthcare establishments.

DDMA asked the administration to establish a 24x7 control room manned by a subdivisonal magistrate-level officer for grievance redressal and ordered all hospitals to appoint an oxygen audit committee for supervising and rationalising the use of medical oxygen. Delhi has no oxygen plant and fully depends on other states for its supply.

The allocation and supply of oxygen to all hospitals in the capital will be strictly regulated as per the Centreâs allocation orders and supervised by IAS officer Ashish Verma, the officer on special duty in the health department. He will be assisted by two senior officers.

DDMA ordered that IAS officer Udit Prakash Rai would be responsible for ensuring smooth and seamless movement of tankers till the borders of Delhi and would sort out and redress all issues regarding suppliers, and the state and central governments. The AAP government has claimed that other states are stopping the supply from their oxygen plants to Delhi.

Another IAS officer, Vijay Bidhuri, has been made responsible for controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to the hospitals. The 24x7 control room, which will function under him, will operate a helpdesk manned by an SDM-level officer and eight others for redressing all grievances and complaints received from the central, Delhi and private hospitals within half an hour of their receipt. Otherwise, it will be the âresponsibility of Vijay Bidhuri to look into the said complaints/grievances and resolve the sameâ, DDMA stated.

Delhi Police will keep a record of entry and exit of tankers through various check posts and the same will be conveyed to the control room immediately. A green corridor will be provided to all tankers from this point. Special commissioner of police Muktesh Chander has been appointed the nodal officer and will provide all help and security logistics for movement of all tankers from the production sites to hospitals.

The hospital oxygen audit committee will collect data on the usage and stock of oxygen and furnish daily data and information as required by the government from time to time, DDMA ordered. The hospitals will appoint nodal officers who will be available round the clock for any matter relating to the coordination and redressal of grievances regarding supply of oxygen.

91,Airlift oxygen for Delhi from Odisha: BJP,"BJP State president Adesh Gupta on Thursday suggested that the Delhi government airlift oxygen allocated to the national capital from Odisha, till the supply stabilised.

He also suggested that the Delhi government procure essential drugs, such as Remdesivir and Fabiflu, from manufacturers to distribute to patients in need here.

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, meanwhile, accused the Delhi government of failing to have put in place any concrete policy to deal with the severe COVID-19 crisis that hit the Capital and led to the virtual collapse of medical facilities."
91,"Create special corridor for oxygen supply to Delhi, HC directs Centre","We all know that this country is being run by god, says Bench

The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to immediately create a special corridor for safe and swift passage of oxygen tankers from neighbouring States such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to the Capital.

Delhi has been allocated 480 metric tonnes of medical oxygen by the Central government to tide over the unprecedented rise in COVID-19 cases. The Delhi government, however, stated that 140 metric tonnes of medical oxygen scheduled to come from Panipat in Haryana were not being allowed to be picked up by the local authorities there.

“The situation in Delhi has rather turned precarious, with several hospitals complaining of complete exhaustion of oxygen or depletion to the level that it may not last after the next few hours,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli remarked, adding, “We all know that this country is being run by god.” “We make it clear that non-compliance of the said order [of April 21] and our order passed today will be viewed seriously since their non-compliance is likely to result in great loss to lives,” it said.

The High Court also directed the Central government to ensure that adequate security is provided to the trucks transporting the oxygen. “A special corridor may be created for immediate transportation of the oxygen,” the Bench ordered.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the Bench that, ""First of all we will have to educate people that Remdesivir is not something which is to be bought off the counter... It is not a drug which you can buy because you feel you have COVID. It will have to be decided by the doctor concerned,” the Solicitor General said.

During the hearing, one of the counsels pointed out that Fabiflu was being distributed by BJP MP Gautam Gambhir in his Lok Sabha constituency area of East Delhi.

The counsel said that the issue is not with Mr. Gambhir’s distribution of the tablet but non-availability of the same tablet in other areas of the Capital.

Bed availability

Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said since there is a four-fold spike in COVID-19 cases in the Capital, the Centre could consider augmenting 80% of the beds in AIIMS Jhajjar, AIIMS Trauma Centre, Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge hospital to make available around 8,000 more beds. “We expect the Central government to look into the requirement,” the Bench said.

The High Court also asked the Delhi government not to put accredited laboratories carrying out COVID-19 testing under pressure to deliver reports within 24-36 hours as it could turn counter productive.

It also asked hospitals, which had approached it over supply of oxygen, to contact the nodal officer of the Delhi government for addressing their concerns."
91,Delhi oxygen crisis: Sisodia writes to Centre,"NEW DELHI: Six hospitals in the national capital have exhausted their oxygen supply while seven others have less than five hours of oxygen left, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday.In a letter to the Union health minister, Sisodia pointed out that six hospitals â Saroj Super Speciality Hospital, Shanti Mukund, Tirath Ram Shah Hospital, UK Nursing Home, Rathi Hospital and Santom Hospital â have exhausted their oxygen supply.The hospitals that have less than five hours of oxygen supply include â Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, BLK Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, Okhla, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Max Superspeciality Hospital, Patparganj, Venketeshwara Hospital and Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, Sisodia pointed out.""Police and senior officials of the administration in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana are stalling the tankers carrying oxygen, delaying the tankers from reaching Delhi hospitals on time,"" Sisodia said in the letter.""I urge you to ensure that the oxygen allocated for Delhi by the Centre reaches there without any delay to save lives of the patients,"" he added.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.The Centre on Thursday directed states to ensure uninterrupted production and supply of medical oxygen and its transport along inter-state borders and said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of the district concerned will be held responsible if there is any violation of its order.The directive under the stringent Disaster Management Act 2005 was issued by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla in the wake of reports that some states blocked supply of medical oxygen to other states amid the sudden spike in coronavirus cases and demand for it.With several private and government hospitals in Delhi running low on medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, the Centre raised the national capital's oxygen quota from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes on Wednesday.Sisodia, however, said the increased quota has either not reached Delhi or there have been considerable delay.Meanwhile, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) appointed two senior bureaucrats as nodal officers to ensure smooth movement of tankers and facilitate oxygen supply to city hospitals, and directed the Delhi Police to provide security logistics from manufacturers' sites to various health facilities here."
91,"Ensure security for oxygen transport to national capital, HC tells Centre","Large number of patients in ambulances wait to be admitted to the LNJP hospital, New Delhi (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)

The Delhi High Court Thursday directed the Centre to ensure that security is provided for vehicles transporting oxygen to the national capital after it was told by the Delhi government that obstructions were created in Haryana’s Panipat and Faridabad by local authorities.

During a marathon hearing of over four hours on the challenges being faced by Delhi in tackling the escalating Covid crisis, a division bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli ordered that a “special corridor be created for immediate transportation of the oxygen”.

Addressing Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who was representing the Centre, the court mentioned the Haryana Chief Minister and said: “Mr (Tushar) Mehra, Panipat is about two hours from Delhi. You should be able to get in the next couple of hours. You do not even have to wait for this order. Your one word to Mr (Manohar Lal) Khattar would do the job.”

Earlier, Senior Advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, told the court that out of 140 metric tonnes of total oxygen allocation from Air Liquide, Panipat, the state could get only 80-82 MTs on April 21 and nothing on Thursday.

With several counsel informing the court about shortage of oxygen in hospitals, the court observed: “Practically all hospitals in Delhi are going to face this situation. We shudder to think what is going to be the situation tonight.”

Oxygen cylinders stacked up at Yamuna Sports Complex, which has now been converted into isolation centre, in New Delhi on Wednesday. Oxygen cylinders stacked up at Yamuna Sports Complex, which has now been converted into isolation centre, in New Delhi on Wednesday.

On an application regarding the funding of medical treatment for construction workers, the court had said in an earlier order that funds available with Delhi’s welfare board for construction workers under The Building And Other Construction Workers Act, 1996, can be utilised for providing food to daily wagers.

However, Shyel Trehan, who was representing National Campaign Committee for Central Legislation on Construction Labour, said the unions apprehend that the Rs 3,000 crore corpus will be wiped out by the board in this process.

“(But)…since it is before you, I don’t think they would be doing that,” she submitted. The court said: “We don’t guarantee that and I don’t think Mr (Rahul) Mehra will guarantee that. As it stands, we all know this country is being run by God.”

On shortage of beds in Delhi, the court said: “We expect that the Central Government will look into the requirement of Covid-19 beds and work to enhance availability of such beds in central government hospitals and facilities”.

The Centre earlier told the court that it has dedicated more than 4,159 beds for Covid patients in hospitals under its control in Delhi. However, the Delhi government submitted that the number also includes isolation beds. It sought at least 7,000 beds for Covid patients in Centre-run hospitals.

At one point, Justice Sanghi observed: “It is a four-fold increase (in cases). People are not getting beds. Forget about the ordinary man on the road, even if I were to ask for a bed, I would not get it easily.”"

95,5 hrs of oxygen left: Sir Ganga Ram Hospital,"<p>Earlier in the day, the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) had said their oxygen stock could last till 10 am on ... Read More

NEW DELHI: The Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Thursday sent an SOS to the Delhi government, saying there is only five hours of oxygen left at the facility, and requested that it be replenished urgently.

""At 8 pm, the oxygen in store at the hospital was for five hours for peripheral use till 1 am and less for high flow use. Need urgent oxygen supplies,"" an official of the hospital said.

There are 510 coronavirus patients , including 142 patients on high flow oxygen support, admitted in the hospital located in central Delhi.

""The hospital is in touch with the agencies. Need urgent supplies,"" the official said.

Earlier in the day, the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) had said their oxygen stock could last till 10 am on Friday.

""Many more patients with high flow need got admitted to the hospital. Almost 40 patients are extra,"" the official said.

Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock.

The Delhi High Court had on Wednesday night ordered the Centre to ""forthwith"" provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious COVID-19 patients, observing it âseems human life is not important for the stateâ.

The central government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta , assured the court that it will facilitate supply of the increased allocation of 480 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi and the same will reach the national capital without any obstructions.

However, several private hospitals complained their suppliers have not been responding to calls, forcing them to use their back up.

After hospitals in Delhi, Gautam Buddh Nagar hospitals are also facing oxygen shortage due to lack of supply. Prakash Hospitals, which has branches in Noida and Greater Noida, released a statement on Thursday afternoon stating their 140 Covid-19 patients are at risk as they had only a few hours of oxygen supply left.

“For the last few days, the hospital has been facing serious difficulties in procuring adequate and regular supplies of oxygen. Presently our supplier from Faridabad has denied us the supply saying the Haryana government has ordered them to prioritise Haryana first, then Delhi and the remaining supply to Uttar Pradesh,” the hospital said in a statement.

According to hospital officials, there are 55 patients in its Noida branch while another 85 have been admitted in the Greater Noida hospital. As per data at 12.30 pm, the Noida Hospital had an oxygen supply left for another two and half hours while oxygen in the Greater Noida branch would last for 3 hours. The hospital made an urgent, pressing appeal to the state administration for oxygen to prevent a “calamitous” event.

“In our last conversation with hospital authorities, they informed us that there is an arrangement for oxygen for the next four hours. They have two suppliers, one of them is from Faridabad. The administration is in touch with the hospital authorities and vendors to resolve the issue,” said Kumar Anand, administrative nodal officer for Parkash Hospital.

The patients inside the hospital have been told to arrange for individual oxygen cylinders and to be prepared for discharge in case the supply does not reach on time.

On Thursday afternoon, Kailash Hospitals, owned by Gautam Buddh Nagar MP Dr Mahesh Sharma, also reported shortage of oxygen supply for Covid patients. The hospital presently has halted admissions till the oxygen supply is ensured. The hospital authorities are being assured by the administration that the supply will be normalised by Friday."

His demise was described as a big loss by the party president Chaudhary Anil Kumar.Senior Congress member Ajay Maken said Walia was the architect behind the development in the Trans Yamuna area of Delhi. âAs a health minister, he laid the foundation for a series of government hospitals in the capital.

The information was also passed on to the integrated control room in Noida, facilitating admission. Since he was a Noida resident, we thought it will not be difficult to access health services in Noida,â a close aide of Maliwal said.However, on reaching the hospital, the family alleged they were made to wait outside for over an hour during which Swaroop collapsed. Maliwal later tweeted, âMy nana died waiting for emergency support in front of Sharda Hospital Greater Noida. I kept standing there for half hour and pleading for admission and nothing happened. Shame! Pathetic!âThe DCW chief told TOI, âMy grandparents live in Noida and since my grandfather was down with Covid, I spoke to someone at a Noida hospital where I was promised a bed too. We couldn't even find an ambulance initially. However, when we reached the hospital, I was made to run around for an hour after which they denied giving us a bed. By that time, his condition was deteriorating and we eventually lost him.âThe hospital told TOI it did not have a ventilator or ICU bed that it could allot to Swaroop immediately. Ajeet Kumar, spokesperson for Sharda hospital, said, âWe kept trying to arrange for a bed for Janardhan ji when he reached our hospital. Since we were not informed about his need and condition in advance, we could not offer a ventilator or ICU bed to him on an immediate basis. We have a lot of critical patients. Ventilator beds and ICU wards are packed to capacity.â"
97,Dog parents find a solution to pet peeve in Covid times,"New Delhi: Achal Gupta has been getting at least five calls daily for the past two weeks from people who are inquiring about dog boarding. As Covid-19 cases hit the population of Delhi with unprecedented intensity, Covid-positive dog parents found themselves in a dilemma, not being able to cater to their dogâs daily needs or take the pet out for walks. Gupta and his wife are doing such distressed families a good turn. They currently take care of 17 dogs from beleaguered households.Boarding stations, like Guptaâs, provide a safe home to the animals, feed and groom them and care for them even for weeks if their owners are unable to. Guptaâs Jeffuryâs Pet Store Spa and Resort in Mundka has the resources and infrastructure for 50 canines.âWe have been getting enquiries not only from Delhi, but also from other cities. There have been times when relatives of isolated dog parents have informed us of their predicament,â said Gupta, some of whose family members themselves are infected by the coronavirus. âThere were three occasions when we had to break into a house to get to the dogs.â Many owners, Gupta explained, donât realise their pets need daily care until they are incapacitated.At Kuldeep Chauhanâs Pet Loverâs Hut in Junapur village in south Delhi, guest dogs have an ample 18,000 sq feet of space to romp around in. âRelatives of Covid patients drop the dogs at the gate and we bathe the dog and give them new leashes before bringing them inside,â said Chauhan. âThere is enough space here for them to run around and for us to accommodate their daily home routines.âArun Shivakumar, a TCS employee, and his wife run Asha Arunâs Pet Home as a passion project from a three-acre farm where they live with their seven dogs and two horses. Shivakumar said, âWe currently have 32 dogs for boarding. We get daily calls from families in which a member is Covid-positive. Initially, we refused such requests for boarding, but realised the pets needed to be cared for. So, we take all precautions and board the dogs.âAt MSF Abode, recent graduate Ananya Kashyap said, âI get a lot of calls from dog parents, so I keep the dogs here for the period till they recover from Covid.â Since she does not have a lot of space, she takes one or two dogs at a time and tries to feed them food they are used to at their homes. âI have one that is here now for two months because her parents are not in town,â said Kashyap, who makes sure of her own safety by giving every dog a proper bath before admitting it to her small boarding station."
98,CBSE to give more weightage to competency based questions in new academic session," In order to implement the competency based learning, as mentioned in the National Education Policy 2020, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Thursday changed the composition of assessment tasks for students from classes 9 to 12 for the new academic session (2021-22).“While the overall marks and duration of examination shall remain the same, a change in the composition of assessment tasks would help us achieve the desired ends. Therefore, in the forthcoming sessions, a greater number of competency-based questions or questions that assess the application of concepts in real-life/ unfamiliar situations will be a part of the question paper,” director (academics) Joseph Emmanuel said in a circular to all heads of CBSE-affiliated schools.The board added that the decision was taken as the NEP 2020 “has affirmed the need to move from rote learning to competency-based learning, making it more focused on developing the creative and critical thinking capacities of students to meet the challenges of the 21st century.”For instance, the composition of the question paper for classes 9 and 10 was changed to accommodate fewer short or long answer questions (from 60% last year to 50% this year) and to introduce 30% competency-based questions -- in the form of multiple choice questions (MCQs), case-based questions, source-based integrated questions and other types -- instead of the 20% case and source-based questions last year.For classes 11 and 12, the short/long answer questions have been reduced from the earlier 70% to 60% this year and 20% weightage has been given to competency-based questions.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, said, “There is a slight change in the composition of theory paper to enhance competency-based learning through various forms of questions. This can help students score better. The board has also specified that students can expect MCQs or source-based or case-based questions in this session.”"
99,Testing count down by 42k since April 11,"New Delhi: Testing has reduced significantly in Delhi over the past few days even as the infection is surging. Doctors say this will adversely affect timely diagnosis , isolation and treatment of Covid-19 patients. âTesting, tracking and treating are the main pillars of Covid management,â said a doctor.

Most patients, he said, are put on Covid-19 treatment based on symptoms because results take too long or the labs simply refuse home collection citing unavailability of staff.

âItâs been seven days since I placed a test request. The lab claims unavailability of staff. I have tried two other labs, but they are also refusing to do the test,â said Anshu Verma, a resident of Malviya Nagar. Many people are getting CT scans and X-ray done for assessment of the infection spread in the absence of tests.

On April 11, the Delhi health department said 1,14,288 Covid-19 tests had been carried out in 24 hours, the highest till date. Data shows the number has been declining since. According to Thursdayâs health bulletin, 72,208 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours, a reduction of nearly 42,000. The number of RT-PCR tests, considered the gold standard for Covid testing, has also declined sharply â from 76,954 on April 11 to 48,436 on Thursday.

âWe have been running the labs twice, thrice the capacity. Our staff are exhausted and some have even contracted Covid-19,â the head of a prominent lab chain in central Delhi said. Many people are still getting tests done for travelling or just to confirm if the infection has subsided, he said. âWe need to rationalise the prescription of Covid-19 tests in the current circumstances.â

100,How This Doorstep Delivery Is Saving Lives,"New Delhi: With the number of Covid-positive cases spiralling to unheard of heights, families and medical institutions have been struggling with hospital beds and oxygen cylinders. But unknown to most, cooked meals have also become a huge problem for many people. Fortunately, in the era of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, citizens have stepped forward to prepare and deliver food to Covid-hit families or those affected by the weeklong lockdown.Some households are unable to prepare meals due to Covid isolation. Class XII student Avantika was deeply moved by such problems. Two weeks ago, she asked her parents if they could start distributing food to quarantined Covid patients . âMy parents agreed immediately and we started a week ago,â said Avantika. âMy parents are both great cooks and since their work was suspended due to the lockdown, it was a great opportunity to assist others. We get around 50 requests a day but are able to respond to only around 30.âPuja Bahri knows what about the challenges of fighting the coronavirus infection, having been a patient herself last year. So, she decided to prepare and deliver home food to people in southeast Delhiâs New Friends Colony who are unable to cook at home. Pitampura resident Abha too has been feeding such families. âThere are so many Covid cases around us,â she said. âI cook every day for my family so I might as well cook extra food for people who need meals. I am doing it free of cost.âIn east Delhi, Bonku Roy and her family are involved in this good work. âIn a WhatsApp group, the members started discussing voluntary cooking for Covid patients. I promptly volunteered and my family backed the idea,â said Roy. âWe get around 100 requests every day, but regrettably, we are able to respond to around 80 and serve them meals twice daily.âThe Halduniya family of south Delhi, whose many members were infected by the coronavirus last year, swore to make things easier for those who had contracted the disease this year. âThis is the least that we can do,â said Priyanka Halduniya, who serves home-cooked meals to people in and around Safdarjang. âMy elderly mother-in-law and father-in-law also contribute in the meal preparation for around 35 families.âAfter giving meals to the migrant labourers last year, Dr Ruchi Mittal continued with the commercial kitchen she had started. âWith Covid rising, we began getting requests for home-cooked food,â said Mittal. âSince most of my staff of 10 arenât coming to work due to the lockdown, we are unable to cater to every request.âFamilies that cannot afford to pay get free food from Navneet, who runs MCKS Food for the Hungry. He charges only those who can. Ashwini Shroff too does the same. âI started the service on April 14 April and get around 600 calls every day,â said Shroff. âWe distribute around 200 food packages in the day and around 200 at night.â"
101,"Cop, 2 others cremate man after kin refuses to go near body","A policeman and ambulance staff cremated a 35-year-old man, after his mother, wife and other relatives refused to touch the body in north-east Delhi’s Gokalpuri, fearing that he’d died of Covid-19, police said on Thursday.The man, police said, repaired air-conditioners for a living. He stayed with his wife, son and mother.Sushil Singh, assistant sub-inspector, said the man fell ill around April 15.“He first visited a local doctor and took some medicines. When he got fever, he visited a private hospital for admission, but was told to approach a bigger hospital. He returned home without any further treatment,” said Singh.On Monday night, he died. “Everyone believed that he died of Covid-19, although he had not got tested for the disease. His family did not approach the body for fear of infection. Someone made a failed attempt at calling an ambulance before dialling the police,” said Singh.Singh reached the house and called several ambulance services, but none responded. He then went to GTB Hospital to request a private ambulance, said Sanjay Kumar Sain, deputy commissioner of police (north-east).The policeman then took the body to a hospital, and from there to the mortuary for autopsy, the DCP said. The family did not accompany him, police said. On Tuesday afternoon, the policeman and the two of the ambulance staff cremated the body. “I have received both doses of vaccine, but I would have done this duty even anyway,” said Singh."
101,Policeman performs last rites of victim after family disowns body,"Nobody came forward to help fearing infection, says officer

After the death of a suspected COVID-19 patient, his family refused to go near the body fearing infection. At that moment, a Delhi police officer, ASI Sushil Kumar, came forward and single-handedly carried out all the procedures and last rituals — transportation of the body, getting post-mortem conducted and finally the cremation.

Sonu Kumar, an electrician, was suffering from high fever and breathing problems. He was visiting a local clinic for treatment. When his condition worsened on April 19, he went to a hospital in East Delhi. However, he was turned away in the absence of bed and scarcity of oxygen supply. He went back home and died later in the day. Neighbours told his wife that they should not touch the body as he has died due to COVID-19 infection, said the police.

“The deceased was survived by his mother, wife and a 12-year-old son and after his death they all have shifted themselves to ground floor of the house while the body was on first floor,” said Mr. Kumar.

“I reached the victim’s house after receiving a PCR call. Not a single person from the locality came out to help. Even the family members refused to come forward. I kept trying for an ambulance the entire night and called up at all helpline numbers but all in vain. After getting no help from anywhere, I went to GTB Hospital on April 20 and managed to arrange a private ambulance.

“After everyone refused to hold the stretcher from the other end, I somehow convinced the ambulance driver to help,” said Mr. Sharma.

He added that as the family suspected that their kin died due to COVID-19 infection, he took the body to Hedgewar Hospital to get medico legal case (MLC) and then reached GTB Hospital mortuary to get post-mortem done.

“I took the body to Mayur Vihar cremation ground and performed the last rites,” said Mr. Kumar.

ASI Sushil Kumar told The Hindu that he was equally concerned about the safety of his colleagues and wanted to involve as few people as possible for the exercise."
102,Delhi police on their feet to keep the Capital breathing,"Braving adverse situations, they are working to help hospitals and patients out

Around 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Thakur received a panic call from Batra Hospital saying their oxygen supply was going to end in two hours. The hospital apparently told him that they have been trying to manage cylinders for the last three days but were unable to arrange.

With other senior officers in tow, he rushed to the hospital and spoke to the management, who were panicking because lives of more than 350 patients were in their hands.

The first task was to identify where they could procure the oxygen from, as the hospital required liquid oxygen tankers. Teams then identified that one oxygen tanker was travelling to GTB Hospital. “But at that crucial point, the driver wasn’t picking the call. We had to trace him and almost intercept him,” he recalled. The team then went to GTB Hospital with the tanker before bringing it to the Batra Hospital.

Meanwhile, police got another lead that an oxygen tanker was coming from Haryana’s Samalkha. But the old hassle surfaced. The driver’s traced location didn’t match with what he was saying. He was finally found in West Delhi and brought to Batra Hospital.

“Amid all this, we were informed that the oxygen had completely run out and some patients were having seizures. The pressure was mounting. Around 12.30 a.m., Samalkha tanker reached and by 1 a.m., the one from GTB too came. We helped them with seven tonnes of oxygen,” he said, adding that over 100 policemen were involved in this mission for five to six hours.

One hurdle after other

Reflecting on the situation, a senior officer termed coordinating as the toughest challenge, besides pointing out that supplies are disrupted as more oxygen is required but there is no arrangement to meet the demands.

“Planning for the second wave was not conducted in terms of oxygen and hospital requirement. There is a huge lack of a tracking system, which would make oxygen supply smooth and check consignment,” he said.

Production of oxygen has not been enhanced as it should have been and internal disputes of several stakeholders appears to have lead to this chaos, sources said of their opinion after observing ground situation. Sources said that many officers are infected in the force and for some, their families are infected due to which they need leaves which seniors can’t deny.

“Much of our resources are diverted to the healthcare situation while we have to ensure the lockdown is imposed and guidelines are followed,” an officer said.

Additional DCP (Outer) Sudhanshu Dhama has been attending distress calls for the last few days. The latest was from Rathi Hospital, who were in a dire situation on Wednesday evening with lives of 78 patients at stake. Mr. Dhama, who was in the hospital till around 3a.m. on Thursday, along with his teams, managed to arrange 120 oxygen cylinders from Bawana, Kanjhawala, Mayapuri and even from another hospital.

“We had to plead with other hospitals,” he said, adding that hospitals are scared to help because of the fear of cylinders running out.

The police are stretched, but they keep on helping the city breathe. “At this point, one cannot say this is not my job because the situation is such. One cannot demarcate. Right now, we are providing help by whatever means we can,” he said.

DCP (North) Anto Alphonse, who had arranged oxygen for NKS Hospital from Mayapuri by going in person, said his control room has been attending to PCR calls from people calling for hospital beds, life-saving injections, oxygen cylinders and even ration. He said they are trying their best to meet their needs while adding that coordinating for oxygen with suppliers is a task at the moment, he said.

Coordination pangs

Pranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini), also said that coordinating with gas agencies for oxygen and then providing it in that short span of time to the hospitals is challenging. “We arranged 50 oxygen cylinders for a private hospital and they were delivered in two hours. They were arranged from Bawana and Khanjhawala,” he said.

According to the data shared by Delhi Police, only 5-10 officials were testing positive till April 4. But the numbers soared to 263 on April 20. There was marginal respite, as it came down to 193 on Wednesday."

103,Red Fort violence: court allows police to obtain Deep Sidhu’s voice sample,"Video clips, Facebook Live have been taken on record: police

A court here on Thursday allowed Delhi Police’s plea to obtain the voice sample of actor-activist Deep Sidhu, accused in connection with the Red Fort violence on Republic Day.

Metropolitan Magistrate Sahil Gupta allowed the application in which the police claimed that in order to authenticate the voice of the accused in several videos (Facebook live, TV interviews etc.), it was necessary that his voice was matched with the voice in those video clippings.

Mr. Sidhu was arrested on February 9 and was granted bail by a Delhi court on April 16 in the case. He was later arrested in another related case and is currently in judicial custody, while his bail application is pending in the matter.

In its application, the police said that during the investigation, it came to the notice that accused was live on Facebook page and also made various posts on the date of incident. “These video clips/Facebook live have been taken on record which contain the voice of accused,” the police told the court, while seeking his voice sample.

The plea was opposed by Mr. Sidhu’s counsel, saying that the police plea was an infringement of his fundamental rights.

While allowing the police plea, the court termed as ‘premature’ the arguments made by the counsel for the accused that the application was vague and lacked any concrete detail of the videos for which the voice sample was required, saying that “the manner in which investigation is to be done is the prerogative of the investigating agency.”

Quality of evidence

“Also, at the stage of investigation, one cannot assume that by obtaining the voice sample, false evidence by tampering with the video clips could be imputed against the accused.

“The admissibility and quality of evidence is a question to be determined during the trial and not at the stage of investigation,” the court said."

Manjinder Singh Sirsa, who heads the Sikh body, said that they send food packages to each house based on their demands.DSGMC has set up a separate langar to prepare meals for Covid patients across the city. The packed food is distributed from four gurdwaras to those who have called on the recently launched helpline number. âFrom Wednesday, Bangla Sahib Gurudwara is not the only gurudwara where food is being prepared for needy people. For those in north Delhi, the meals are being cooked in Gurdwara Nanak Piao, for those in east Delhi at Gurdwara Sis Ganj and for those in south and west Delhi at Gurdwara Moti Bagh Sahib,â said Sirsa.There are thousands of people, including migrant workers and Covid-infected families, who need help of this kind. âBecause we are getting thousands of requests, we are sending food from four gurdwaras in different parts of the city so that people get hot food at an appropriate time. Earlier, we were preparing meals only at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib,â said Sirsa.On Wednesday, the Sikh body prepared 15,000 food packages and distributed them mostly among migrant workers and labourers who have been hit by the weeklong lockdown. It also sent 1,200 food packages each in the morning and evening to Covid-hit families.Last year, when the pandemic was at its worst, DSGMC had similarly delivered food packages to thousands of people. Ever since, there have been occasional requests for the service from people that the body complied with. Those in need of food had become acquainted with Sikh volunteers last year, and apparently they have been directly contacting them with requests for food."
105,"Dargah shut, but its iftari feeds scores every day","New Delhi: The Nizamuddin Dargah , which decided last week to shut down due to the rising cases of Covid-19 , has been packing 1,000 food packets daily and distributing them in the neighbourhood and among the homeless in the area during the weeklong lockdown.During Ramzan , the dargah usually sees a massive crowd gathering during the iftar to break their fast with the food provided from its langar, functional for over 800 years. Hundreds of men, women and children turn up around the mausoleum every day during this period.The dargah was also shut during the last Ramzan due to the pandemic, and this year, too, the Nizamuddin Dargah Committee decided on April 16 to close it till April 30.Stating that the âdecision was taken in respect of the current pandemic situation and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelinesâ, Altamash Nizami, joint secretary of the committee, added that while the dargah would remain closed for public and devotees, they would continue to serve langar and iftar by making food boxes and distributing them in Nizamuddin Basti.Since the shutdown of the dargah, over 1,000 packets have been distributed. âWe make sure that there is no crowd.

129,"Small cos get hit most by lockdowns, may default","Mumbai: Non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) and rating agencies have warned of delinquencies in the small and medium enterprises segment if the lockdown continues. Lenders said, unlike last year when they got additional credit lines and relief in the form of a moratorium , small businesses do not have enough cash to see them through a prolonged shutdown.

âWhile it is too early to comment on the extent of the impact on the asset quality of retail loans due to the rising Covid cases, there is reason to be cautious. After the nationwide lockdown last year, we had witnessed a severe drop in collections for most asset classes though the availability of a moratorium provided a breather from an NPA-recognition perspective,â said Abhishek Dafria, VP and head (structured finance) at Icra.

Dafria added that while the current restrictions are localised and less harsh, the severity has been gradually increasing as the surge in Covid cases is yet to be brought under control. Pointing out that last year it was microfinance and unsecured SME loans that had the highest delinquencies after the lockdown period, he said that the risk categorisation would remain similar for areas that see stronger government restrictions.

According to lenders, they would be helpless if the loans slip into non-performing asset ( NPA ) category as then no further relief can be given and they would have to initiate recovery proceedings. Last year, in addition to the moratorium and emergency credit line, a SC order had prevented banks from classifying delinquencies after the Covid outbreak as NPAs.

Since default by small businesses could result in credit freeze to this segment, the RBI might be forced to look at a moratorium if the lockdown restrictions get extended geographically and extend for a longer period.The Finance Industry Development Council, which represents NBFCs, has written to the RBI seeking an extension of the one-time restructuring of MSME advances till March 2022, as the companies are yet to revive their businesses due to the surge in Covid cases.

âDue to the severe second wave of COVID-19, the MSMEs as also the retail and wholesale trader industry have not been able to revive their economic activities and therefore are in urgent need of support from the lenders. Various surveys and reports are forewarning that the operating environment for banks will most likely remain challenging, as the second wave could dent the sluggish recovery in consumer and corporate confidence, and further, suppress banksâ prospects for new business,â the council said in its letter to the RBI governor.

According to bankers, the combination of moratorium and emergency credit line guarantee scheme in the previous year helped to protect banks, NBFCs and small businesses. âLast year, the additional line of credit enabled some of the small business to clear expensive loans to NBFCs and the moratorium provided relief until business started. This time around, many small businesses will not have the capacity to remain afloat if the lockdown is extended,â said a senior banker.

129,US weekly jobless claims hit 13-month low; home sales tumble,"WASHINGTON: The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a 13-month low last week, suggesting layoffs were subsiding and strengthening expectations for another month of blockbuster job growth in April as a re-opening economy unleashes pent-up demand.

While the labor market recovery is gaining speed, red flags are emerging in the housing market, the economy's star performer during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Sales of previously-owned homes tumbled to a seven-month low in March as prices jumped to a record high amid an acute shortage of houses, other data showed on Thursday. Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.

Even as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased Covid-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks.

""We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

""However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.""

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the labor department said.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week.

It was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of Covid-19 infections.

There were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.

Claims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.

The latest labor department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.

The weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through September 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.

Including the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.

Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

Broad improvement

The United States has expanded Covid-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of US adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.

That, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.

Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April.

The economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.

""Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

""Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.""

But the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday.

The plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100.

Sales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.

""Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.

Still, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10.

The so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.

About 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.

The new advertising slot, which will be rolled out by the end of the month, will allow advertisers to promote their apps across the whole network, rather than in response to specific searches, according to the report.

The report comes as Apple plans to send prompts to iPhone users to allow apps to use their data for personalized advertising, a move that has drawn backlash from tech rival Facebook Inc , which argues the changes will hurt the social media company's ad business.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

132,Lenders to report taxpayers’ interest income above,"The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has issued detailed guidelines on how banks and companies will report information related to interest and dividend income of taxpayers.Section 285BA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and Rule 114E require “specified reporting person” to furnish a statement of financial transaction. According to the notification issued on Tuesday, banks will have to report the details of all those taxpayers whose interest income across deposits exceeds 5,000 in a fiscal year.For companies there is no minimum limit. They will have to report details of the dividend paid to every shareholder. In March, the tax department issued a circular directing a few entities including banks, companies and brokers to report the interest, dividend, and capital gains earned by investors to the tax department every year.The purpose of this is to enable the tax department to provide pre-filled information in the tax forms to the taxpayers. In the Union Budget 2021-22, the finance minister announced that taxpayers will get information related to capital gains and dividend pre-filled in their tax forms.The guidelines will help in uniform reporting by the entities. “Reporting entities are required to prepare the data file in prescribed format from their internal system.The statement of financial transactions shall be furnished on or before May 31, immediately following the financial year in which the transaction is registered or recorded,” said the notification.“The statement shall be signed, verified, and furnished by the specified designation director of the bank,” it added.The banks will report the interest income earned by the account holder across the bank accounts, including, savings account, recurring account, and fixed deposits. However, interest earned on Public Provident Fund (PPF), foreign currency non-resident account, resident foreign currency account, and Sukanya Sumriddhi account is not required to be reported.Banks will have to report the gross amount. They can’t give the deduction of 10,000 under Section 80TTA. The taxpayer can claim the deduction by filing the income tax return (ITR).In case of joint account holding, the interest paid or accrued will be assigned to the primary or first account holder. If the account is in the name of a minor, the information will be reported against the name and permanent account number (PAN) of the legal guardian.The bank will have to report separately for each account type—savings, recurring deposit and fixed deposit. The bank will also have to send the information reported to the tax department to the taxpayer so that they can reconcile the information and check with the Form 26AS."
132,Prices of essential goods climb as curbs hit supply,"Mini-lockdowns and movement restrictions across India have disrupted supplies and pushed up prices of some essential goods, even though availability remains better than last year when hoarding and broken supply chains led to Several consumers reported delayed deliveries, even as fear and anxiety boosted demand for products such as cooking oils, pulses, sanitisers, masks and oximeters.Ashmit Dalal in Mumbai’s Andheri said staff shortage at kirana stores is leading to delays and cancellations. In Maharashtra, store timings are limited to 7am-11am, with home delivery allowed up to 8pm.Priyanka Singh in Mulund, too, said BigBasket was delivering only every two days in her area, though hyperlocal e-commerce platforms like BBdaily, Frazzo and Supr Daily were quicker.Neha Grover in New Delhi said prices of fruits and vegetables were up in the last few days. Grover has been relying on HalloBasket, an online marketplace for fruits and vegetables, for her large family. Grover, who lives in Greater Noida, said finding tender coconut water was tough. Across markets, the price of tender coconut has risen from 35-40 to 80 per piece in the last few days, vendors said.Customers also reported delays in online delivery orders across platforms such as Grofers, BigBasket and Amazon, especially in Vaishali Choudhury in Noida complained about not finding stocks in her neighbourhood supermarket.“The second covid wave has led to a surge in orders across cities on our platform. In view of the pandemic situation, we had worked on increasing our capacity and building infrastructure throughout last year and also in early 2021. As a result, BigBasket is making deliveries in all our operating cities, albeit with extended timelines in some cities due to unexpectedly high demand and movement curbs,” a BigBasket spokesperson said.Indians aren’t hoarding like last year when supply chains snapped entirely.Though large companies are ensuring supplies, consumers are facing intermittent challenges in areas under lockdowns as mobility is restricted and demand for essentials is up.In parts of Delhi and Chandigarh, distributors and wholesalers said prices of mustard oil are up by 10-15%, while that of pulses and rice were up 8-10% over the last few days. Certain brands of cooking oils are in short supply, said a wholesaler.“Edible oils have been seeing price hikes in the past two quarters; some increase in milk and wheat (prices) happened earlier, too. On the fresh produce side, price hikes are very local and not pan-India. Localised enhanced demand has come up and is creating some opportunistic approach from some suppliers,” said Akshay D’Souza, chief marketing officer at Bizom, a retail intelligence platform that tracks grocery sales across retail stores.At Narang Chemist in New Delhi, supplies of sanitisers are intact, but the owner fears supplies could be delayed for everything over the coming days. On e-commerce platforms, the price of some oximeter models went up in the last five days from 1,999 to 2,499."
133,India & Covid: Nirmala Sitharaman at first of Express-FT series today,"In the first of a series of online, agenda-setting debates organised by The Indian Express and Financial Times, policy, business and finance leaders from India and overseas will gather for a discussion on India’s place in the post-pandemic world.

Kicking off the event, titled ‘India’s Quest for Economic Power’, as the keynote speaker will be Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in conversation with journalists from both FT and The Indian Express.

‘India’s Place in the Post-Pandemic World’ is the broad theme of the online series that begins Thursday. With the Covid-19 pandemic and second wave of infections clouding the outlook for India’s economic and business growth, the discussions will revolve around what should be the government’s key policy priorities to rebuild the economy to ensure a resilient, sustainable recovery, and to attract foreign investments. Pending structural reforms are another key theme that will be under focus.

The interview with Sitharaman will be followed by a panel discussion on sustained growth with KV Subramanian, Chief Economic Advisor, Jahangir Aziz, Head, Emerging Markets Economics, JP Morgan; Rohini Malkani, Senior VP, Credit Ratings, Global Sovereign Ratings, DBRS Morningstar and P Anbalagan, CEO, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC). Even before the shock of Covid-19, India’s economy had been losing momentum, with growth steadily slowing. Now, after a large GDP contraction due to the pandemic, medium to long-term prospects remain uncertain amid a second wave of infections.

Martin Wolf, Chief Economics Commentator, Financial Times, will deliver a keynote address on India in the post-Covid world economy, followed by a round of discussion on whether Indian companies can compete globally. This comes at a time when larger companies are seen to have weathered the shock much better than smaller ones, with profits supported by cost cutting, and improved market share gained at the expense of weaker rivals, even as most smaller firms are still burdened by heavy debt, disruption in supply chains and weak demand. The participants include Sidharth Nath Singh, Cabinet Minister of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME), Export Promotion, Textile, Khadi, Village Industries, Sericulture in the Government of Uttar Pradesh; Naushad Forbes, Co-Chairman, Forbes Marshall; Shobana Kamineni, Executive Vice Chairperson, Apollo Hospitals; and Manish Sabharwal, Chairman and Co-Founder, Teamlease Services.

The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"

Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"
135,Ensure cashless treatment for COVID: IRDAI,"Amid reports hospitals denying facility, regulator steps in

Insurance regulator IRDAI has asked health insurance companies to ensure that policyholders entitled to cashless treatment are extended the facility by all the hospitals that have agreed to provide the same.

“It is clarified where insurers have an arrangement with hospitals for providing cashless facility, such network hospitals are obligated to provide cashless treatment for all treatments, including treatment for COVID-19,” the regulator said on Thursday.

The IRDAI statement followed reports of some hospitals not granting cashless facility for COVID-19 treatment.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had tweeted: “Reports are being received of some hospitals denying cashless insurance. Spoken to Chairman, IRDAI Shri S.C. Khuntia to act immediately. In March’ 20 COVID included as a part of comprehensive health insurance. Cashless available at networked or even temporary hospitals.”

All the network providers (hospitals) who have signed service level agreements with general and health insurers have to mandatorily provide cashless facility for any treatment to the policyholders in line with the agreed provisions of the SLA and as per terms and conditions of policy contract, the IRDAI statement said.

Advising insurers to ensure “smooth availability of cashless facility at all the network hospitals empaneled with them,” IRDAI said the aggrieved policyholders can lodge complaint with the concerned insurance company. Details and email ids of the grievance redressal officers of insurers can be accessed on: https://www.irdai.gov.in/ADMINCMS/cms/NormalData_Layout.aspx?page=PageNo225&mid=14.2.

In a circular to the insurers, the regulator said, “where any network provider denies cashless facility and deviates from agreed terms of the SLA, insurance company shall take an appropriate action...”

While Union Finance Ministry tweeted the IRDAI communication, Ms. Sitharaman shared the same saying “IRDAI acts on reports.”"
135,"HC dismisses FB, WhatsApp pleas","The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed pleas by social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp, challenging India’s competition regulator’s order directing a probe into WhatsApp’s new privacy policy.Justice Navin Chawla said though it would have been “prudent” for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to await the outcome of petitions in the Supreme Court and the Delhi HC against WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, but not doing so would not make the regulator’s order “perverse” or “wanting of jurisdiction”.The court said it saw no merit in the petitions of Facebook and WhatsApp to interdict the investigation directed by the CCI. The CCI had contended that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals’ privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.It had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and “stalking” of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position.“There is no question of jurisdictional error,” it had contended and added that WhatsApp and Facebook’s pleas challenging its decision were “incompetent and misconceived”.WhatsApp and Facebook had challenged the CCI’s March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy."

137,"Surge biggest recovery hurdle, says RBI guv","Mumbai: Rapid rise in Covid cases is the single biggest challenge to the ongoing recovery in the Indian economy, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das has said, asserting that previous yearâs learnings should, however, help in managing the crisis as it unfolds.âThe need of the hour is to effectively secure the economic recovery underway so that it becomes broad-based and durable. The renewed jump in Covid infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook,â the governor said in the minutes of the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting, which was released by the RBI on Thursday.âIn such an environment, monetary policy should remain accommodative to support, nurture and consolidate the recovery. We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,â Das had said.While the RBI expectedly kept rates on hold, it had surprised markets by announcing a Rs 1-lakh-crore government bond purchase programme, which helped bring down interest rates. While the RBI did reiterate its accommodative stance while announcing the MPC decision, a reading of the minutes emphasises the dovish stance. âGoing forward, The RBI would continue to ensure ample surplus systemic liquidity and the system would remain in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy,â Das had said in the MPC meeting.He had said that indicators suggest that the real GDP was evolving on the lines of the February MPC resolution.âImproving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects. The recent jump in Covid infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully,â Das had cautioned.Deputy governor Michael Patra had also expressed concern over recovery. âMonetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure-footed and its sustainability assured,â he said. He pointed out that risks to the recovery have become accentuated since the MPCâs February meeting with new waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations, moderation in several high-frequency sentiment indicators, global risks and spillovers.âThe economic recovery can come under risk if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon,â said Mridul Saggar, executive director, RBI and a member of the MPC. âThis is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit the loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort,â he added."
137,"‘Rising cases biggest threat to recovery’, says RBI guv Shaktikanta Das","Rising Covid-19 cases constitute the single biggest challenge to economic recovery, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das told the monetary policy committee (MPC) earlier this month, according to the minutes released on Thursday.Compared with the policy statement, the minutes read gloomy: Das said the recent jump in cases and its impact on needs to be carefully monitored.“The need of the hour is to effectively secure the economic recovery underway so that it becomes broad-based and durable. The renewed jump in coronavirus infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the overall growth outlook,” Das said.Contrast this with the policy statement earlier this month, when the central bank said: “The renewed jump in  in certain parts of the country and the associated localized lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary.”RBI executive director and MPC member Mridul Saggar, too, raised his pitch on the risks to economic recovery if the new wave of infections is not flattened soon.He added that health policies hold the key to India’s recovery as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of the space through stimulus measures. “Learning effects on calibrating stringency of restrictions may keep economic costs of the second wave much lower than the first, but still retard full normalization by a quarter or two. Ramping up vaccination, testing and treatment hold the key to protecting economic recovery and health policies have become the first line of defence. Monetary and fiscal policies can only play a second fiddle,” Saggar added in the MPC minutes.RBI deputy governor and the MPC member Michael Patra, who is usually the most hawkish among all members, however, softened his stance. He said the focus remains on reviving the economy.“I would continue to look through the recent elevation in inflation and remain focused on reviving the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth. An integral part of this approach would be to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and volatility so that congenial financial conditions continue to support growth,” he added.MPC member Jayant Verma said the challenges need time-based forward guidance amid the uncertainties and evolving economic state.Since October the MPC has maintained an accommodative stance “during the current financial year and into the next financial year”, which is reflective of a time-based forward guidance.“I think it is not prudent to repose excessive faith in forecasts. Instead, the MPC must have the agility and flexibility to respond rapidly and adequately to whatever surprises new data may brings in the future. Time-based guidance is inconsistent with this imperative,” Verma said."
138,CSR funds can be used to set up Covid facilities: MCA,"The government on Thursday allowed spending of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for setting up makeshift hospitals and Covid-care facilities, including vaccination for general public, to reduce stress on existing healthcare infrastructure, two officials close to the matter said.An official clarification issued by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) said “... that spending of CSR funds for ‘setting up makeshift hospitals and temporary Covid-care facilities’ is an eligible CSR activity...” and companies may undertake it in consultation with state governments. The communication is, however, silent on vaccination.Spending of CSR funds to prevent spread of Covid-19 pandemic has already been an approved CSR activity since March 23, 2020, which also includes vaccination and distribution of medicines and preventive materials, if undertaken for the general public, the officials mentioned above said, requesting anonymity.“Companies can use the fund for vaccination of their staff as well as general public as preventive healthcare activities, but it cannot be exclusively for company employees only,” said one of the officials with direct knowledge of the matter.Companies can spend more money from their CSR accounts to prevent Covid-19 pandemic now and get the additional amount adjusted in subsequent years, the official said.The Companies Act requires firms with a net worth of 500 crore or more, or turnover of 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of 5 crore or more in the immediately preceding financial year to mandatorily spend 2% of average net profit of the preceding three years on the CSR. Money earmarked for spending on CSR activities in a year is about 15,000 crore.After issuing the official clarification, corporate affairs secretary Rajesh Verma wrote to the top management of over 1,000 companies, appealing to them for “more coordinated and focused approach” to provide immediate relief to the people.“I would like to draw your attention to the excellent initiatives taken by the DRDO and the CSIR in setting up temporary Covid-care facilities and makeshift hospitals,” he said adding that this could also be replicated by other firms.In an appeal to CEOs, Verma said: “Further, in view of the ongoing work-from-home mode of working, you may have some vacant buildings at your disposal. You may like to consider converting these buildings to temporary Covid Care facilities.”"
139,Swiss authority to probe Credit Suisse over trading losses,"(File photo)

GENEVA: Switzerland's financial markets authority said Thursday it is looking into possible penalties against Credit Suisse after the top-drawer bank announced "" significant losses "" linked to a US-based hedge fund .

The authority, FINMA, said it will require ""various risk-reducing measures"" and investigate ""possible shortcomings in risk management"" at Credit Suisse. The authority said it is appointing an outside agent to look into the issue.

Two weeks ago, the bank announced it was taking a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.7 billion) charge linked to a default on margin calls by US-based Archegos Capital . Credit Suisse did not identify what it called only a ""US-based hedge fund"" _ but the authority did.

The authority said such ""enforcement proceedings"" against financial institutions typically take months, depending on the complexity of the matter. FINMA does not have the power to impose fines, but can order changes within financial institutions and set limits on them.

A margin call is triggered when investors borrow using their stock portfolio as collateral and have to make up the balance required by banks when the share prices fall and the collateral is worth less.

FINMA also confirmed it opened in March proceedings against the bank in connection with its so-called ""supply chain finance funds,"" a financial instrument that is reserved for select clients.

The bank announced a suspension in redemptions and subscriptions in the funds on March 1 over insolvency issues linked to partner Greensill Capital .

FINMA's announcement came shortly after Credit Suisse reported a net loss of 252 million francs ($275 million) in the first quarter, largely due to the one-time charge.

CEO Thomas Gottstein said: ""The loss we report in this quarter, because of this matter, is unacceptable."" He noted steps including an independent probe ordered by the bank. The bank has also said two top executives had left in the wake of the troubles.

The bank, in its quarterly report, said the one-time charge offset ""positive performance across wealth management and investment banking.""

Net revenues jumped 31 per cent to 7.57 billion francs ($8.3 billion), while the pre-tax loss came in at 757 million francs ($826 million)_ compared to a 1.2 billion franc net gain in the quarter a year ago.

In its outlook, Credit Suisse said it expects market volumes to return to ""lower, and more normal, levels in the coming quarters"" _ and expects a residual charge of about 600 million francs ($655 million) in the second quarter due to the hedge fund troubles.

It said it has now exited 97 per cent of related positions linked to the hedge fund matter.

140,Samsung leader Jay Y Lee attends trial amid calls for pardon,"Samsung Electronics vice chairman (File photo)

SEOUL: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd Vice Chairman Jay Y Lee on Thursday made his first public appearance since being jailed in January, as he attended court to face charges of fraud and stock manipulation amid calls for his release.

The 52-year-old head of the world's biggest memory chip maker wore a dark suit and white shirt as he entered the courtroom for the hearing, media reported.

The heir to one of South Korea's most powerful family-run business empires is accused of fraud and stock manipulation and could face a fresh jail term if convicted.

Pressure is mounting on the government to pardon Lee for a previous conviction of bribery and other offences, for which he has served half of a 30-month sentence.

Business lobby groups and some lawmakers say he should be freed to help South Korea secure supplies of coronavirus vaccines.

""Utilising Vice Chairman Lee's global network will help in securing the COVID-19 vaccine,"" Kwon Tae-shin, vice chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries, told Reuters.

A conservative opposition member of parliament, Park Jin, told Reuters South Korean investment in semiconductor production in the United States also could be leveraged to secure US vaccines.

Samsung is considering building a $17 billion chip factory in the United States, while Seoul has noted its potential role in helping US President Joe Biden preserve the global chip supply chain.

The United States has said its first priority is vaccinating Americans, although it has promised to look into options to help other countries bolster their supplies.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in is due to visit Washington for a summit with Biden next month.

South Korea has reported 116,661 coronavirus cases and 1,808 deaths from Covid-19, but just 3% of the population has been vaccinated due to problems with vaccine supplies.

Former world number one Adam Scott has decided to skip the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics this year to spend time with his family, the Australian's manager told Golf Channel on Thursday.

Scott, who won the Masters in 2013 and gained the number one ranking a year later, also withdrew from the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games because he was worried about the possible transmission of the mosquito-borne Zika virus .

""With the world being the way it is, Adam is gone 4-5 weeks at a time this year during his playing blocks,"" his manager said in a statement.

""With three young children at home, this time in the schedule will be devoted to family. It is pretty much the only time up until October when he has a chance to see them for a stretch of time and not only a few days a week.""

Scott, ranked 35 in the world, is the second top golfer to say he would skip the Tokyo Games after world number one Dustin Johnson did not put his name forward for a spot on the U.S. team last month.

Johnson had said he wanted to focus on the British Open and the PGA Tour .

The Olympic golf tournament starts on July 29 -- 11 days after the final round of the British Open at Royal St. George.

All six English clubs which signed up to the breakaway league on Sunday promptly withdrew and were swiftly joined by Inter Milan and Atletico Madrid . German clubs including deposed Champions League holders Bayern Munich never agreed to join.

Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has insisted the project is not finished and could be presented again in a different format but Tebas, a long-time opponent of the Super League, said it was effectively doomed.

""The Super League is dead without the English and German teams, let's be realistic, it's dead,"" Tebas told a virtual news conference on Thursday.

""They cannot create the project they want to create. After 20 years of threatening a Super League, finally this threat came true and in 48 hours it has disappeared.""

Perez said the Super League was urgently needed to prevent top clubs from going bankrupt after their revenues were badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic and clubs being unable to sell match tickets or merchandise.

But Tebas said the situation was not as extreme as Perez suggested it was, saying the clubs who have been crippled financially merely needed to control their spending on wages and transfer fees.

""This isn't a problem of revenue, these clubs need to reduce their expenses. We don't need to keep increasing earnings so that players can have seven Ferraris instead of six,"" he said.

""This is a problem of distribution. My position is very clear, we don't need to increase revenues, we just need to manage expenses. We are not ruined financially and we don't have to take any exceptional measures.""

The founding members of the European Super League were wrong to form a closed competition not based on sporting merit and made a mistake by not considering the views of players, managers and fans, Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti said on Thursday.

The Super League project collapsed on Wednesday as most of the 12 founders from England, Italy and Spain abandoned the breakaway project after it drew the ire of fans, politicians, soccer officials and even the British royals.

""It was a strange day for every football supporter, a surprise. We heard about the Super League the past few months but I was sure it was not going to happen,"" Ancelotti told reporters ahead of Friday's Premier League trip to Arsenal .

""The 12 clubs were wrong. They didn't take into consideration the opinion of the players and managers and the supporters.

Unlike in the Champions League , where teams have to qualify through the domestic league, the founding Super League teams guaranteed themselves a place in the new competition every year.

""The most important part, they wanted to build a competition without sporting merit,"" added Ancelotti. ""This is not acceptable... This is what they didn't take into consideration, they were wrong.""

Everton are eighth in the standings, three points above Arsenal with a game in hand, but have been on a five-match run without a win in the Premier League.

However, Ancelotti is boosted by the return of top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Yerry Mina, Bernard, Fabian Delph and Andre Gomes who are all available to face Arsenal.

""It's a really important game, not decisive but important. I think we are ready,"" the Italian said.

154,Ex-British Cycling doctor Freeman launches appeal over doping ruling,"Richard Freeman. (Reuters Photo)

LONDON: Former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman has launched an appeal after being found guilty of ordering banned testosterone for doping purposes.

Freeman was permanently struck off the medical register last month after a tribunal ruled he had ordered Testogel ""knowing or believing"" it was to be given to an unnamed rider in 2011.

Freeman's new legal team confirmed on Thursday that an appeal had been lodged with the High Court , with the hearing expected to take place in November or December.

""Mr Freeman is innocent of wrongdoing and we are confident that the truth will ultimately be recognised by the UK justice system,"" said solicitor Graham Small.

Freeman, who was simultaneously employed by British Cycling and Team Sky -- now Ineos Grenadiers -- between 2009 and 2015, resigned from British Cycling in 2017 because of ill-health. He had already left Team Sky.

Freeman admitted 18 of 22 charges against him but denied the central charge regarding the purpose of the Testogel order.

He claimed the Testogel was ordered to treat former performance director Shane Sutton 's erectile dysfunction, which the Australian vociferously denied, before storming out during a tumultuous day of evidence in 2019.

The appeal is likely to focus on Sutton's evidence and the tribunal's conclusion that he was a credible and consistent witness.

Freeman is also facing two UK Anti-Doping charges regarding the ordering of the testosterone.

The Sports Authority of India on Thursday suspended a Project Officer-turned coach employed by it with immediate effect and ordered an enquiry after he was arrested for alleged sexual assault on a minor girl.

The accused, who is above 50 years of age and is an athletics coach, is currently lodged in Tihar Jail under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The SAI said it has learnt that a coach under its payrolls has been arrested after an alleged incident of molesting a 13-year-old girl, reportedly at the Siri Fort Sports Complex where he was giving her private training.

“The alleged incident happened in a non-SAI premises, where the coach was imparting training to the said minor. The coach was imparting training on his own without sanction from Competent Authority,” the SAI said in a statement.

“The coach has been suspended and an enquiry has been ordered with respect to breach of conduct rules by the said coach. The alleged incident is being investigated separately by the police under relevant provision of law.”

According to a SAI source, the coach breached his service agreement on two counts — first imparting private training without taking due approval and second under the POCSO Act, which calls for immediate suspension of a government servant.

If found guilty under the POCSO Act, the coach can be punished for a maximum jail sentence of seven years."

Any one particular thing you have been wanting the team to produce consistently?

Veteran striker SV Sunil was left out for the Argentina tour, which raised a few eyebrows. How difficult are such selection decisions?

Does Tokyo weather call for selection of younger players, who can last longer in humid conditions while playing, for example, five games in 7-8 days?

Do you consider postponement of the game vs Great Britain a setback or did you anticipate that considering the Covid graph?

Covid has ruled the Indian team off-side once again. The rule was abolished by 1992, but a virus is still playing by it -- halting teams right when they seem to be building up pace.India set off on the road after a year and in their first two official internationals, the team got the better of Olympic champions Argentina . But the day they returned home from South America, the virus struck again.India's next away fixture of the Pro League , which was scheduled for May 8 and 9 against Great Britain in London, has been postponed. With the virus mutating and spreading like wildfire in India, the government of the United Kingdom has put India on its 'red list'. Hence, the team can't travel.While that's the unfortunate bit, it doesn't take the shine off of what the Indian team achieved in Buenos Aires.The visitors showed some steel to come back and level the first game at 2-2, before claiming the bonus point in a shootout. The second game saw India dominating the hosts. A 3-0 win was the kind of scoreline coach Graham Reid was looking for.Of the six matches in the Argentine capital, India lost just one, which left Reid chuffed about the outcome.In an interview with Timesofindia.com at the conclusion of the tour, the Australian shared his notes, while keeping Covid central to what lies ahead on the road.We were very happy with the results. Of course, we lost that fifth game. Sometimes you need those wake-up calls every now and then for the players to understand that they have to bring out their best every time. Sometimes as a coach you sort of think, 'Okay, you need those things as medicines.'We need to be a little more frugal in defence. That's still valid. It's always (a) work in progress. As we play against [top] teams, they will try and do things differently to try and beat us. So we have to constantly change our structure a little bit.That's the great thing about competition -- the ability to keep plugging the hole. So when a team [opposition] does that, this is what we do. So if you have experienced it before, you end up with better planning at the end of it.The other thing, of course, is we are trying to make sure we make the most of all the opportunities and try and convert those opportunities into better ones. We had a good number of circle penetrations, but we would like to create more quality opportunities. That's what we will be spending a bit of time on between now and Europe [Pro League tours]. We are working on that.One of things that we worked on was our ability to maintain (a) sustained attack -- what I have been trying to develop with the guys. If the gap is not there at the moment, we [should] move the ball, go to the other side, check. It gives you a bit more control.What we are chasing, of course, is more quality attack based on that. Those things take a while. You train for something and then you see it starting to come [happen] in a game until a little later on. We need to keep working on that, getting them [players] to understand when it's better to just hold the ball, wait for the right opportunity. Having said that, I still like to attack (laughs). So there has to be the right balance.I prefer not to talk about selection in public, to be honest. All I can probably say is it's going to be a really tough selection [for upcoming tours]. Every time you are selecting from this [core] group, it's hard because the quality is there.What I am really trying to do is develop the breadth of the squad, which means when it comes to picking a team, you have the best players available...options. Covid is still a real concern, so you perhaps need even a broader base than you need in a normal campaign, so that you have got quality players who can come in at any point in time.That's what we are trying to do, provide opportunities and also provide as much competition in the squad so that we are pushing ourselves to be better and better.Tokyo will be a tough environment, when we have back-to-back games. That's the good thing about [Pro League tours of] Europe. We will get opportunities to play consecutive games. Historically at the Olympics, there's been a nice gap between games but this time there are going to be back-to-back games. So it's an important skill to have for players to be able to maintain the high tempo of the game.It's good to have players who give you experience but also some youth to bring in the enthusiasm and the extra energy. That's again a constant balance that you try to achieve as a coach.I've said this before, that with the changing scenario world-over due to Covid, we have to take each day as it comes. That is why I always tell the team to not worry about things that are not in our control.For now, our focus is to utilise the facilities in SAI Centre Bengaluru to make the necessary changes to our game based on the Argentina tour analysis and continue as per [Pro League] schedule in Spain and Germany."
155,Pliskova fights back to set up clash with Barty in Stuttgart,"Karolina Pliskova. (AFP Photo)

STUTTGART (Germany): Karolina Pliskova will face world number one Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals of Stuttgart's WTA clay-court tournament after seeing off Jelena Ostapenko in a three-set battle on Thursday.

Pliskova, the sixth seed, recovered from losing the first set in a tie break by firing down 21 aces, 10 of which came in the last set alone, for a 6-7 (7/9), 6-4, 6-3 second-round win.

""I like spending time on this court,"" joked Pliskova, the 2018 Stuttgart champion, after needing just under two and a half hours to claim victory.

""It was a far better performance from me,"" she added, having laboured in Wednesday's victory over lucky loser Tamara Korpatsch.

Thursday's result was almost identical to Pliskova's win over Ostapenko in the 2018 quarter-finals in Stuttgart when the Czech went on to capture the title.

Former French Open champion Ostapenko hurled her racquet in anger in the second set, while Pliskova broke one of hers as she regained control of the match.

""It always helps me when I break a racquet,"" the Czech said.

Pliskova, ranked ninth in the world, plays top seed Barty of Australia in the last eight Friday.

""She's on a good run and has won a few tournaments, but I have nothing to lose,"" added Pliskova.

Barty, who won a pre-Australian Open tournament in Melbourne and the Miami Open earlier this month, breezed into the quarter-finals Wednesday by overpowering Laura Siegemund following a first-round bye.

She is using the Stuttgart event as part of her preparations for next month's French Open, where she won her first Grand Slam title in 2019.

She sat out the 2020 tournament at Roland Garros because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

NEW DELHI: India's Olympic bound athletes' training-cum-exposure trip to Turkey has been ""suspended"" as the contingent wouldn't be allowed to train owing to a mandatory 14-day hard quarantine in that country.

Olympics-bound javelin throwers Neeraj Chopra and Shivpal Singh were to be among the group to travel to Turkey this month, along with the quartermilers both men and women but the tour has been put on hold.

""Our athletes will have to undergo a 14-day hard quarantine if they have to go to Turkey. This would mean that they will not be allowed even to go out of their rooms, they will not be able to train,"" a reliable team source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

""This is a competition period and athletes cannot be rested that long during this phase. They have to train, so there is no point resting for 14 days and spending a lot of money. So, the tour is suspended as of now,"" he added.

As per earlier plan, Shivpal and his coach Uwe Hohn were to leave for Turkey on Friday as they have got visas but they are not doing so.

""Neeraj has been waiting for his visas (for Turkey) but in any case, the tour has been suspended,"" the source said.

He said the Athletics Federation of India is planning to change the destination of the training-cum-competition tour to Czech Republic.

""We are looking at the javelin group travelling to Czech Republic around May 5 and the quarter-mile group on May 15. But these are subject to getting the visas (Schengen visa).

""As of now, there is no mandatory quarantine period to be served after reaching Czech Republic. But nobody knows what the protocols will be at a later date.""

He also said that all the track and field athletes and officials camping at the NIS Patiala have returned with negative RT-PCR tests conducted on April 19. Earlier, 10 track and field athletes and officials at the NIS have tested positive but none of them were Olympics-bound.

""All the 63 track and field athletes and 30 support staff have tested negative on April 19. We are all COVID-19 free. It is a green zone for us now.""

158,IPL 2021 Preview: MI seek consistency as PBKS eye return to winning ways,"Mumbai Indians would be aiming to address their batting woes to achieve consistency while Punjab Kings would be desperate to arrest their overall slide when the two sides clash in an IPL match here on Friday.

The Rohit Sharma-led Mumbai crashed to defeat against Delhi Capitals following an inept batting performance and will look for redemption. The skipper shone with the bat, but others could not get going and the misfiring middle-order would be a major concern for the side.

The MI bowlers have more often than not risen to the occasion and won matches for the team.

However, they couldn’t do so against Delhi and would like the batters to put up bigger scores for them to do the job.

Rohit looked in good touch against Delhi. However, Suryakumar Yadav and Ishan Kishan, stars of the team’s victorious 2020 campaign, have not been able to make match-winning contributions and that has hurt MI along with middling performances from Kieron Pollard and the Pandya brothers — Hardik and Krunal.

It is still early days in this year’s IPL but Mumbai Indians would like its players to find form and consistency and a match against an under-performing Punjab could well be the beginning.

Punjab have flattered to deceive after a winning start. Being shot out for 120 by Sunrisers Hyderabad on Wednesday hinted at bigger problems for the KL Rahul-led team, which has more than one issue to resolve, especially its composition.

The formidable batting unit hasn’t hit the straps, save for Rahul and Mayank Agarwal and the bowling has been pedestrian.

‘Universe Boss’ Chris Gayle has not been able to boss over proceedings while his fellow West Indian Nicholas Pooran, expected to provide the big shots in the middle, has come a cropper so far.

Three straight losses would have definitely dented Punjab’s morale and the team needs to recover quickly or else its play-off hopes would slip fast.

Rahul has got two fifties in four games so far but has lacked support from others. His captaincy has not inspired a lot of confidence and muddled team selection has compounded his woes.

Deepak Hooda showed what he is capable of, but greater consistency would be needed from him if the team has to prosper.

They bet on Australian pace imports Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith to up the ante but they have proved expensive and already lost their place in the XI.

Punjab may look to bring in the talented Ravi Bishnoi in place of Murugan Ashwin and fit in Chris Jordan in the XI.

Mumbai Indians Squad: Rohit Sharma, Adam Milne, Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Arjun Tendulkar, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Neesham, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Marco Jansen, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Piyush Chawla, Quinton De Kock (WK), Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult, Yudhvir Singh.

Punjab Kings Squad: KL Rahul (c & wk), Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle, Mandeep Singh, Prabsimran Singh, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Sarfaraz Khan, Deepak Hooda, Murugan Ashwin, Ravi Bishnoi, Harpreet Brar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ishan Porel, Darshan Nalkande, Chris Jordan, Dawid Malan, Jhye Richardson, Shahrukh Khan, Riley Meredith, Moises Henriques, Jalaj Saxena, Utkarsh Singh, Fabian Allen, Saurabh Kumar."

MUMBAI: Devdutt Padikkal managed to overshadow none other than the great Virat Kohli with an elegant hundred in Royal Challengers Bangalore's successful 178-run chase against Rajasthan Royals , in a virtual cakewalk of an IPL contest here on Thursday.It hardly happens that someone as brilliant as Kohli, plays a second fiddle, allowing the talented left-hander use his sinewy wrists to caress the balls to all parts of the ground during a mind-blowing maiden IPL century -- an unbeaten 101 off 52 balls.RCB never looked in any tearing hurry and yet the target was achieved in only 16.3 overs with all 10 wickets intact.ScorecardKohli went on the offensive once Padikkal had ensured victory as his contribution was 72 not out off 47 balls in their unbroken opening stand of 181.The RCB juggernaut continues to roll with their fourth victory on the trot and a strong foundation in the points table going into the third week of the tournament. Royals, with a team that hardly inspires confidence, are again looking good for bringing up the rear.The sixes that came off Padikkal's blade was more about timing than power as he hit 11 fours and six sixes during his knock.Picking the length of Mustafizur Rahaman's short ball and getting into the shape to execute a perfect pull-shot for a six showed why experts feel that it's only a matter of time before he dons national colours.The inside out chip off Riyan Parag over extra cover to complete his half-century off 27 balls, the sweep shots, the slash over backward point and the straight sixes with economy of footwork, were all testimony to his solid technical foundation.Once Padikkal was in his mid 80's, the RCB skipper chanced his arms including a six over extra cover off Royals' costliest buy Chris Morris.Kohli's 50 came off 34 balls and was followed by a personal milestone of 6000 runs in IPL as Royals surrendered way before the match officially ended.Earlier, Rahul Tewatia's impressive death overs hitting ensured a fighting 177 for 9 for Rajasthan Royals after yet another familiar top order no-show.On a good batting surface, Royals managed a total which may be 25 runs short but credit for the decent score goes to a counter-attacking effort from all-rounder Shivam Dube (46 off 32 balls) which stemmed the rot and big-hits from Tewatia (40 off 23 balls) that helped them get past 175-run mark.Dube smashed two sixes and five fours and with Riyan Parag (25 off 16 balls) giving him good support, added 66 runs for the fifth wicket off only 6.2 overs to give his team's total some semblance of respectability.While the giant all-rounder was comfortable playing at ""home"", using the pace of deliveries, the profligate top-order of Royals once again flattered to deceive along with their skipper Sanju Samson , who has been ""consistently inconsistent"".It took Dube's impressive effort to lend some muscle to the Royals' rickety-looking scorecard.For RCB, Mohammed Siraj's (3/27 in 4 overs) off-cutter first-up cleaned Jos Buttler (8) and Manan Vohra (7) , with another atrocious shot selection off Kyle Jamieson (1/28 in 4 overs), might have ensured a lengthy spell for himself in the dug-out.Siraj then unleashed a perfect toe-crusher for David Miller (0) as skipper Virat Kohli made a perfect call for DRS.Samson (21 off 18 balls), maintained his near decade-long IPL tradition of fizzling out after one or two good knocks as a six off Washington Sundar was followed by an indiscreet chip shot at mid-wicket.Dube's two sixes in one over from Yuzvendra Chahal (0/18 in 2 overs) over long-on forced Kohli to take his leg-spinner out of attack.Kane Richardson (1/29 in 3 overs) then denied Dube on what would have been a good half-century as Tewatia upped the ante in the final overs along with Chris Morris."

KOBE (Japan): Rahil Gangjee got off to a disappointing start with a 2-over 73 in the opening round of the Kansai Open Golf Championship, a part of the Japan Golf Tour .

Gangjee, who spent two weeks in preventive quarantine before joining the Tour last week, missed a cut last week. He will need a strong second round to make the weekend action.

Starting on the 10th hole, the Indian golfer ran up three bogeys in the first seven holes on 12th, 14th and 16th.

He recovered with birdies on 17th and first, but a dropped shot on the ninth, his closing hole, was a dampener as he was placed 88th.

Japan's 21-year-old Tomohiro Ishizaka, runner-up to Takumi Kanaya at Dunlop Phoenix in November, 2020, shared the lead with 25-year-old compatriot Tomoya Ikemura, who shot 65. Both players have yet to win on Japan Tour.

Ishizaka is playing only his 13th pro event and had a Top-10 finish last week at Token Homemate. Kanaya, last week's winner, shot 2-under 70 and was T-24.

160,End of road for Sushil Kumar; Amit Dhankar picked for wrestling’s final Olympic qualifier,"Former Asian champion Amit Dhankar (74kg) on Thursday replaced national gold-medallist Sandeep Mann in the Indian wrestling team for the upcoming World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, signalling the end of the road for veteran Sushil Kumar.

The tournament, to be held in Sofia, Bulgaria from May 6-9, will be the last qualifying event before the Tokyo Games.

One of the country’s most accomplished athletes, Sushil won a silver in the 2012 London Olympics, four years after a bronze in Beijing.

After not being considered for selection, the 37-year-old Sushil told PTI, “To stay alive is more important at this stage. I have not spoken to WFI as yet, will speak to them.”

The team was picked by the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) after a meeting of its selection committee, the federation said in a press release signed by its assistant secretary Vinod Tomar.

Besides Dhankar, the others in the free style team included Satyavrat Kadian (97kg) and Sumit (125kg).

“In free style, the committee has made replacement in 74 kg. Sandeep Mann, selected for Asian Qualifier and Asian Championship, didn”t produce satisfactory performance. Hence, the committee decided to give chance to Amit Dhankar who secured second position in the selection trials held on March 16,” the WFI said in the release.

The greco roman team comprised Sachin Rana (60kg), Aashu (67kg), Gurpreet Singh (77 kg), Sunil (87 kg), Deepanshu (97 kg) and Naveen Kumar (130 kg).

“In greco roman style, the committee made replacements in 60 Kg. and 97 Kg. The wrestlers selected in these weight categories — Gyanendra and Ravi respectively gave poor performance in both competitions (Asian qualifier and Asian championship).

“Hence, the committee gave chance to Sachin Rana and Deepanshu who secured 2nd positions in the selection trials.

Seema (50kg), Nisha (68kg) and Pooja (76kg) formed the Indian women’s team.

“The committee didn’t feel it appropriate to make any replacement in these weight categories as all these wrestlers secured medals either in Qualifying competition or Asian championship.”"

BARCELONA: Rafael Nadal needed to go the distance for the second successive day in Barcelona, defeating Japan's Kei Nishikori to make the last-eight and stay on course for a 12th title at the tournament.

The world number three triumphed 6-0, 2-6, 6-2 over 2014 and 2015 champion Nishikori and next face Britain's Cameron Norrie, a fellow left-hander, for a place in the semi-finals.

Nadal, who suffered a surprise quarter-final exit at the Monte Carlo Masters last week, had also required three sets to beat Belarusian qualifier Ilya Ivashka , ranked at 111, in his Barcelona opener on Wednesday.

Former world number four Nishikori, now down at 39 in the rankings, was left to regret converting just two of 13 break points carved out against the man who also beat him in the 2016 Barcelona final.

World number 58 Norrie progressed when Belgian eighth seed David Goffin retired with an injury in the second set.

Nadal defeated Norrie in their only previous meeting in straight sets in the Australian Open third round in February.

Second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, the champion in Monte Carlo, eased into the last-eight with a 7-5, 6-3 victory Australian 14th seed Alex de Minaur.

Tsitsipas next faces 11th seeded Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime who got the better of compatriot Denis Shapovalov 6-2, 6-3.

""I was happy with my level today,"" said Auger-Aliassime.

""It's never easy to play against him and it's great to have won in straight sets. The next match won't be easy, a tough challenge.""

Russian third seed Andrey Rublev, the runner-up to Tsitsipas in Monte Carlo, claimed a 6-4, 6-7 (4/7), 6-4 victory over Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas in two and a half hours.

Rublev, who has a tour-leading 26 wins in 2021, fired 35 winners past the Spanish clay-courter.

He has an intriguing quarter-final against red-hot Italian teenager and 11th seed Jannik Sinner who defeated fifth seed Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6 (11/9), 6-2.

It was Sinner's third win over the veteran Spaniard this year.

161,World Rally Championship changes gear for Croatia debut,"PARIS: In another stop-start season with several diversions already to the calendar, the World Rally Championship ( WRC ) drives into new territory on Friday with the debut of the Croatia Rally.

After a two-month break, the competition returns on a very different surface.

Toyota's Kalle Rovanpera leads the standings after two events with Hyundai 's Thierry Neuville second and Sebastian Ogier third, though level on points with his Toyota team-mate Elfyn Evans.

Frenchman Ogier, the reigning world champion, won the opener in Monte Carlo .

Estonian Ott Tanak was imperious in his Hyundai in the last race, the Arctic Rally on snow at the end of February.

The Croatia Rally offers a different challenge on roads the WRC website describes as ""a tantalising mix of asphalt .""

It is the first rally 100 per cent on tarmac since the German Rally in August 2019.

The rally is made up of 20 stages over 300.32 kilometres through the mountains around Zagreb.

""I think there are certain sections of the rally where you would like to have something like a racing car, very free and very hard set-up,"" Welshman Evans told the WRC website after winning Thursday's pre-race shakedown.

""But then of course there are sections in which you almost need a gravel car to be honest because it's so dirty.""

Croatia becomes the 34th country to host a WRC rally

""It's like nothing else,"" said Tanak. ""It's not going to be easy.""

The course is windy and while that gives drivers a chance to cut corners, in some places the undergrowth is dense and the roads narrow.

""There are really a lot of curves,"" said Belgian Neuville.

""All the stages are different, some are fast, others very bumpy, especially on Saturday,"" when the drivers twice face a section near the Slovenian border nicknamed the ""stage with a thousand bends"".

At 20, Rovanpera is the youngest ever championship leader.

""I'm not feeling any pressure even though I'm leading the championship,"" said the Finn. ""It's only been two rallies and we have a long season ahead. For sure it's nice to be in this position.""

He is only 12 points ahead of Tanak in fifth.

""In terms of pure performance, I don't see a big gap between the five of us,"" said Ogier. ""It's clearly possible that it will remain tight until the end.""

After Croatia, the WRC will accelerate into the gravel section with four events scheduled by July 18, starting with the Portuguese Rally on May 20-23.

That makes victory this weekend a potentially mixed blessing because the championship leader has to open the road in the next race.

""Good luck to whoever is in the lead after Croatia,"" said Ogier. ""On gravel, the first and second in the championship are likely to be eliminated from the battle by starting first.""

""Asphalt offers a more level playing field,"" Ogier said.

""A victory is always better, but it would probably mean a lot of trouble afterwards."".

162,"Federer is my No 1 inspiration, Rossi Valentino says","PETRONAS Yamaha SRT's Valentino Rossi during the Portuguese Grand Prix at the Algarve International Circuit in... Read More

CHENNAI: These are early days in the ongoing MotoGP season but former world champion Valentino Rossi is yet to get into the groove. Rossi --- a nine-time Grand Prix world champion out of which seven are in the premier MotoGP class --- has managed just four points from the first three races this season.

Rossi may not be at the peak of his powers, but the 42-year-old PETRONAS Yamaha SRT rider is eyeing a turnaround in fortunes at the Spanish MotoGP to be held at the Circuito de Jerez on May 2.

âI will be fighting for a podium (at the Spanish GP ). If I want to win the title, I will have to be fast and deliver good results. And when you are older, you have to train harder to stay at the top level. Luckily, we also have a strong technical partner in PETRONAS that will push me to deliver strong finishes,â the motor racing legend told TOI.

Rossi --- competing for the MotoGP crown with riders much younger to him --- looks for inspiration from icons in other sporting disciplines who have delivered strong shows despite either nearing or in their 40s.

âMy number 1 inspiration is Roger Federer. I adore his game and the way he carries himself. Federer continues to compete even at this age and will cheer for him to win that Wimbledon crown again. There are others such as Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ and Tom Brady who inspire me as well, but Federer is the one who tops the list,â said Rossi, who is into his 26th year as a professional rider.

Rossi knows that he is nearer to the finish line in his career than ever but still wants to give it a shot this season and probably in 2022 before hanging up his boots.

âIn my mind, I feel I can race this year and in 2022. But it will all depend on the results,â he said. Franco Morbidelli, Rossiâs teammate at PETRONAS Yamaha, doesnât want anyone to count the seasoned campaigner out.

âIf Rossi is able to notch up a few podium finishes in the coming races, then he can be one of the contenders to regain the title. He definitely has the potential,â said Morbidelli, who had finished second in the MotoGP rankings last year.

Morbidelli believes it is tough to replicate his 2020 seasonâs performance this year. âItâs more difficult than last year because we have the same package (in our bike) while the other riders have improved ones. It is going to be difficult to fight for the championship title but not impossible,â said Morbidelli who finished fourth in the Portugal GP last week.

163,My level will go up a couple of notches when I get fitter: Sai Praneeth,"NEW DELHI: Ace Indian badminton player Sai Praneeth said that he is looking to get fitter so as to improve the level of his game.Praneeth feels that improving his fitness is what is required for him to bridge the gap between himself and some of the top players in the game as he is not lagging too far behind in the technical aspects.""I don't have many problems with my game but I must get fitter. The level of badminton will go up a couple of notches if I get more fit and remain fit consistently,"" Praneeth told the Olympic Channel Praneeth, who won bronze in the 2019 World Championships, faced Danish world No.2 Viktor Axelsen in the second round of the All England Open earlier in the year and seemed to be on the ascendancy for much of the first half of the match. He won the first game 21-15 and was leading 5-0 in the second when he seemed to slack off and went on to lose the match.""It was a bit of a fitness issue for me in All England. If everything had gone smoothly and I was in a better shape I could have played much better,"" said Praneeth.The 28-year-old Hyderabad player said that he lost almost three weeks in January due to testing positive before the Toyota Thailand Open.""I just wasted three weeks of my time without any fault of mine. Mentally it is also very taxing. In every tournament, you have to get Covid tested multiple times. The results are sometimes inaccurate,"" said Praneeth."
164,Premier League accounts show impact of virus,"LONDON: The Premier League 's annual turnover dropped by nine per cent in the financial fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, accounts for 2019/20 showed on Thursday.The figures, which cover the period up until the end of July 2020, give a glimpse of the economic damage suffered by football as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. Total turnover for the Premier League was Â£2.9 billion ($4 billion), down from the 2019 figure of Â£3.3 billion.International broadcasting revenue brought in Â£1.35 billion, a decrease from the 2019 figure of Â£1.4 billion.The Premier League's strategic report noted underlying turnover had fallen by nine percent, which was ""largely due to the rebates payable to broadcasters following a suspension of play during the season"" because of the pandemic.Football was paused between March and June 2020 before the Premier League season was completed with no fans in the stadiums.During December 2020, the Premier League confirmed a Â£50 million Covid-19 financial support package for English Football League clubs.The accounts revealed payments of government grants of Â£3.3 million but the Premier League stated it ""did not place any employees on furlough"" and also did not take any other ""opt-in government support"" offered in response to the pandemic."
165,Democratisation of fencing in India,"Baby Reddy clucks often during the phone conversation, correcting the details. “No. My father is not a farmer. We have a small house, three buffaloes and grow plants in two pots,” the 17-year-old specifies, slowly.

The fencer, who was at the National Centre of Excellence in Patiala, has been busy correcting a Nationals-score mention against Olympics-bound Bhavani Devi from last month in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand. “It was 4-15. Not 14-15. Anyway she won,” the 16-year-old stresses.

It was an error—the press printed it as 14-15 after Bhavani picked the title, when it was 4-15, but it has fired up Baby’s ambition. “But you must write about the first time I played her. I got 3 points, she got 5. I fought fearlessly. Now there’s fear because she’s Olympics level. Still, I gave her a very good fight,” she says, adding earnestly that the press should call her next when she beats her idol.

A sport that was the preserve of the aristocracy in Europe and posh clubs across the first world, is unearthing talent from India’s remote rural areas.

Three of the five fencers who will travel to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for the last Olympic qualifying tournament this week, are children of farmers. The group includes sabre’s big hope in men, Karan Singh, whose father tills a tiny patch of land on contract in Alwar, Rajasthan. Th Kabita Devi, looking to pounce on the sole qualifying spot in Epee from the continental meet, has a parent in Silchar police.

Bicky Thokchom of Bashikhong in Imphal, Manipur, is also the son of a farmer. While Radhika Avati, who also fences foil, comes from a farming family in Sangli. Epee fencer Sunil Kumar’s father is an ex-serviceman now farming in Jhunjhunu, and it is India’s silent scouting efforts staking out far-flung areas from 2008-9 that have handpicked these potential winners.

Blades that were once held by princes only for their leisure are now picking targets while wielded by children of peasants and beat police. Bhavani has lit a competitive drive across coaching centres of India. Her own background, she came from a middle class home herself, has meant ambitions are upgraded across the nation to aim at the Olympics, undeterred by the prohibitive costs of the equipment.

While Baby belongs to Kadapa in Andhra, she was scouted by coach Bhavani Prasad Dhungana for her speed and combative confidence in a football match. “She was chubby in Class 3 too. But she was so fast while running and in football and the first time she held the weapon, there was no fear. Good aggressive attacking and footwork and confident in lunges. So we brought her from Kadapa to Hakimpet centre,” says the coach.

Sports Authority of Telangana would fund her education and training at a sports school as she started picking medals nationally. And now the teenager is biding her time to be assigned her personal gear at Patiala, while dreaming of her next shy at the iconic Bhavani, set to be India’s first fencing Olympian.

While India’s top six in women’s sabre come from Kerala’s Thalassery centre, the state government sanctioned five more centres in fencing’s southern nursery from where Bhavani took her first strides.

As many as 200 fencers are training in the wings at Munnar, Wayanad and Ernakulam in Kerala, besides the two centres at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.

Sagar Lagu, who started out in Sangli when his local gymnasium owner Rekha Nene went in for a diploma at NIS to coach her daughter in the sport, has pushed the Kerala surge. A topper at NIS himself— “I’m an accidental coach,” he says – Lagu was posted to Kerala. “In 2008 I sent 20 odd coaches to get their coaching certification from Kerala. Then we looked for raw talent from other sports,” says Lagu, who was instrumental in getting Bhavani to Coonoor from Chennai.

A junior Commonwealth and Asian medallist himself, he remembers India’s early days in the sport internationally. It resembled relay-fencing.

Comical outings in the past

“Only one mask and blade would be shared by all. So the board-call announcements would happen somewhere and our fencer would be at another piste waiting for that match to get over and grab his mask and sword. They’d run to where they were to compete wearing the mask on the way and then the next fencer would pick up the equipment and run. It was comical for anyone watching and so many were carded out because a teammate’s match hadn’t finished and the mask wasn’t available,” he recalls.

In the last few years, fencing has been elevated to a priority sport.

And there are grand plans of Excellence centres across the country with foreign coaches to be roped in. The pandemic has put a sorrowful pause on the sport at developmental level. But even before Bhavani’s qualification—a tactical collecting of points was secured—parts of India were buzzing with startup promise.

Like Kerala, state centres have been excellent feeders with diligent low key SAI coaches toiling away in Bhopal, Telangana, Aurangabad to go with the two traditional powerhouses Manipur and Punjab.

“Coaches are scouting out from government and municipal schools as well as village sports meets,” says SAI Patiala coach Kishan Kumar.

A haul of 36 medals at Olympics is the incentive, but some centres throw up natural talent in hordes. Like the Jammu Kashmir State Council centre which is brimming with numbers of talented fencers, nurtured technically by astute coaches.

“For the first 6-7 months, I don’t even give athletes a real blade. They have to be fundamentally strong and disciplined. Immaturity is not permitted in this sport. And whether it’s Aurangabad or J&K, all centres have coaches who drill in basics meticulously,” he says.

Karan Singh was picked for the Army Boys company sports school from Rajasthan along with Chunilal, son of another farmhand. Shiv Mangesh of Kanyakumari was scouted out and quickly got over the shyness he felt as the son of a labourer. Joshna Joseph, Bhavani’s strongest opponent, has a farmer father.

As does foil champion Radhika, who comes from the Thalassery centre. “Initial weapon is Rs 10,000 to 15,000 thousand. But training centres are taking care of that,” Lagu says.

Mumbai though is seeing a mushrooming of fencing clubs in middle class localities of Navi Mumbai and Thane.

“Those clubs also get kids from modest backgrounds. Fencing has no lack of driven athletes, now aiming higher because of Bhavani,” Lagu says."
166,India not producing genuine all-rounders like Kapil Dev because of workload: VVS Laxman,"Former India batsman VVS Laxman on Thursday blamed too much workload of the players for the country not producing another genuine all-rounder of great Kapil Dev’s ilk.

Players like Hardik Pandya have been compared with legendary Kapil, the country’s first World Cup-winning captain.

“It’s a very difficult role being an all-rounder. Kapil paaji was someone who could take wickets and score runs. He was the ultimate match-winner for India. But with the amount of workload nowadays, it’s very, very difficult,” Laxman said during a YouTube launch of a book written by Boria Majumdar at “Tata Literature Live Sports Yatras”.

Without naming Hardik, Laxman said: “There were some glimpses from some players, because they were focusing a lot on both the skills, ultimately with the amount of workload and matches the Indian team plays in three formats, it’s very difficult to manage.

“That player who has the ability to become a genuine all-rounder unfortunately gets injured and he has to compromise or he has to take a decision on either batting or bowling,” said the former stylish batsman.

Coming from a lengthy layoff due to a back surgery, Hardik did not bowl for Mumbai Indians in the IPL last season in the UAE. In the ODI series against Australia, Hardik bowled five overs but did not play the ensuing Test series Down Under.

Hardik did not play in the four-match Test series against England earlier this year. He bowled in the subsequent T20I series, but did not do so in the first two ODIs against England. He returned to bowling duties in the final ODI. He has also not bowled for MI in the ongoing IPL season so far.

Laxman also said that it was “not right to compare any sort of all-rounder with the legendary Kapil”.

“I just feel that there can be only one Kapil. It (comparison) will put undue pressure on the player. There can be only one MS Dhoni, or one Sunil Gavaskar.”"
167,Barcelona’s Joan Laporta maintain support of Super League despite backlash,"Joan Laporta became the club president of Barcelona last month. (File)

Barcelona president Joan Laporta maintained his support for the Super League on Thursday despite the quick exit of 10 of the 12 founding clubs in the breakaway competition.

The Super League, which provoked a backlash by other clubs, fans and authorities around Europe, was announced by a dozen top clubs in England, Spain and Italy on Sunday, but it quickly collapsed and is now officially backed only by Barcelona and Real Madrid.

“It is absolutely necessary,” Laporta said on Catalan public television in his first public comments on the project.

“The biggest clubs create the most financial resources and we must have our say in deciding how the earnings are shared.”

The six English clubs involved in the competition pulled out Tuesday amid escalating backlash from their supporters and warnings from the British government.

A day later, Spanish club Atlético Madrid and the three Italian teams in the project — Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan — also opted out.

Despite being left nearly alone, Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez — the competition’s supposed first chairman — said late Wednesday that the idea was not dead, but rather on standby.

Both Juventus and AC Milan left open the possibility of joining a Super League at a later date in their statements on Wednesday.

Barcelona’s finances have been hard hit by the pandemic, which has compounded problems in a budget that was already loaded by the highest payroll in soccer last season. Laporta’s financial challenges include trying to convince Lionel Messi to sign a new contract when his expires this year.

The 12 elite clubs wanted to boost their revenues by cutting UEFA out of the equation and replacing the Champions League with the new tournament of 20 teams.

“There have been pressures placed on some clubs, but the proposal is still standing,” Laporta said.

“We have very important investments, our salaries are very high, and those must be taken into consideration, along with sporting merits.”

Barcelona’s participation was conditioned by Laporta’s pledge to let the club’s members vote on the proposal.

“We are keeping a prudent stance,” Laporta said.

“It is a necessity, but our club members will have the final word.”

Laporta appeared open to tweaking the most controversial part of the project — locking in the 15 founding clubs and leaving only five berths open for other teams to join each season.

“It has to be an attractive competition, based on merit won on the field,” Laporta said.

“We defend our national leagues and an open dialogue with UEFA.”

While Laporta spoke in Barcelona, the other Spanish league clubs not involved in the Super League project met via videoconference with league president Javier Tebas to form a common front against the new competition. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético were not invited to the meeting.

“I think that Barcelona has bigger problems than taking on the rest of the clubs in Spain and Europe to defend a Super League that is already dead,” Tebas said.

But Tebas saved his strongest criticism for Real Madrid’s president, credited as the mastermind of the project.

“If they say that the Super League will save soccer, they are lying or they are mistaken,” Tebas said.

“Florentino Pérez is lying. It can’t help soccer because it would destroy the national leagues.”"

GRAN CANARIA (Spain): India's Ajeetesh Sandhu finished strongly with three birdies in last six holes for a solid four-under 66 that placed him T-16 even as half the field was yet to finish the first round at the Gran Canaria Lopesan Open at the Meloneras Golf Club.

Sandhu, who played his first event outside India in more than a year last week and made the cut, had five birdies against one bogey in a fine display.

A one-time winner on Asian Tour , Sandhu, who has a lovely swing, had birdies on third and eighth on front nine with a bogey on Par-4 sixth. On the back nine, he birdied Par-5 13th, Par-4 16th and Par-5 18th, which meant he picked up birdies on two of the three Par-5s.

Of the other three Indians in the fray, only SSP Chawrasia had finished but had a disappointing day at four-over 74 with six bogeys against two birdies. Shubhankar Sharma was three-under through 11 holes, while Gaganjeet Bhullar was even par through 12.

Dutchman Joost Luiten, a multiple winner on the European Tour , but who has not tasted success since winning the Oman Open in 2018, started with seven-under 65 which included an ace on 15th.

Luiten, who began on back nine, had an eventful start with birdies on 10, 12 and 13 and a bogey on 11th. A Par on 14 was followed by a hole-in-one on Par-3 15th. He bogeyed 17 to turn in three-under. On his second nine he had four more birdies against no bogeys for a 65.

Sharing the lead with Luiten was Danish golfer Joachim Hansen who had his breakthrough win at Joburg Open in November 2020. He shot a superb seven-under 65 that had four birdies on back nine, where he started and an eagle-birdie on fourth and fifth.

MILAN: Spaniard Pello Bilbao won a three-man sprint to take the mountainous fourth stage of the Tour of the Alps on Thursday as Briton Simon Yates kept the race lead going into the final day.

Team Bahrain's Bilbao edged Russian Aleksandr Vlasov of Astana with Yates, riding for Bike Exchange, third in the 'queen stage' of this year's race from Naturno to Pieve di Bono in northern Italy.

Vlasov and Yates crested the day's last peak seven kilometres from the finish and looked set to duel for victory.

But the 31-year-old Basque rider caught the leaders with a breakneck descent and took the lead in the sprint to the finish.

Colombian Nairo Quintana finished fourth as the former Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana winner gears up for his Tour de France bid.

Bilbao moved up to second overall nearly a minute behind Yates with Ineos Grenadier's Pavel Sivakov, the defending champion, losing time on the final climb to slip to fifth overall.

Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome who has struggled this week was part of a long breakaway with eight other riders during the 168.6 km stage which featured three climbs.

The Israel Start Up Nation rider's group built up nearly two minutes on the peloton before being caught at the foot of the final 10km Boniprati climb.

Froome is 98th overall, 27 minutes adrift of the leader, ahead of Friday's final stage over 120.9km to Lake Garda.

We fought back a Heroic Battle & almost reached their huge target! Not winning this one is not a defeat either. I am so Proud.”

A fan tweeted, “KKR will be back! Good to see the spirit, Much needed for all of us!”

On the work front, Shah Rukh Khan will soon be appearing in Siddharth Anand’s Pathan alongside Deepika Padukone and John Abraham. A Yash Raj production, there has been no official announcement on Pathan yet. The actor was last seen in Aanand L Rai’s Zero, which had tanked at the box office. Zero also featured Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif in pivotal parts."
184,"Ted Lasso season 2 teaser: Jason Sudeikis’ comedy series is back to give you a warm, fuzzy feeling","A teaser for season 2 of Ted Lasso is here. The season appropriately has the tagline – “Kindness is making a comeback.” The Jason Sudeikis-led sports comedy drama series was an unexpected hit for Apple TV+ when it debuted last year in August.

The teaser for season 2 promises more of what we saw in the inaugural iteration. This is obviously a good thing as the first season of the show was clearly one of the best of 2020.

Based on Jason Sudeikis’ own character which he created to promote NBC’s coverage of the English Premier League, Ted Lasso is about an American football coach Lasso who is recruited by an English football team called AFC Richmond. That Lasso does not have an iota of experience with the sport is part of the show’s charm.

While every single character is interesting and written with depth, it is Lasso himself who is the highlight here. Even though his team considers him a dumb and folksy ‘yankee’ they are forced to work with, Lasso is more than he appears. He is possessed with a level of empathy and kindness rarely seen nowadays.

He is not woke and up-to-date with the latest social justice theories, as many TV protagonists are, but comes across as friendly and modest, and wins over people just by being himself. The show illustrates the power of kindness.

His story, behaviour and almost superhumanly optimistic outlook leave the viewer with a fuzzy feeling as though somebody draped you with a soft, warm blanket.

The humour is derived mainly from how people react to Lasso and his dumbfounded reaction as an American to British English, cuisine, and cusswords that are unique to the UK.

The series has an excellent and talented, if not terribly well-known, cast. Hannah Waddingham, Jeremy Swift, Phil Dunster, Brett Goldstein, Brendan Hunt, Nick Mohammed, Juno Temple, among others play supporting roles. All of them return for the second season.

Ted Lasso’s second season premiere on July 23 on Apple TV+."
184,"Vakeel Saab, Master and Krack: South Indian films that revived box office business","The Indian film industry is on the backfoot once again as the country battles an aggressive second wave of the coronavirus. It comes at a time when stakeholders in the theatrical business, especially down south were beginning to make some gains after incurring heavy losses for 10 months since last March last year. The filmmakers in the south showed the way by bringing out big guns and their risks paid off as it breathed a lease of new life in the theatre business.

Krack

Ravi Teja’s cop film came as a much-needed confidence boost to filmmakers down south. The film grossed more than Rs 12 crore worldwide on its opening day. Given that it was released on the heels of the Sankranti holiday, it further helped the box office prospects of the movie. And it ended its theatrical run with reportedly over Rs 70 crore, with a net profit of Rs 40 crore to its investors. That was a solid performance given the 50 percent cap on occupancy at the time.

Master

It was the biggest release of 2021 as it opened on 900 screens across the country. It was, in fact, a big experiment as stakeholders of the industry believed that the success or failure of the Vijay-starrer would decide the future course of big-budget, big star movies in all the languages. It released on January 13 to a lot of fanfare and celebrations and sort of warmed up the engines of the entertainment industry across the country. The film lifted box office gloom and the theatres, particular in the south, sprang back to life. The producers have not officially shared the total collection of Master. However, the trade estimates peg that the film may have collected over Rs 200 crore from its worldwide ticket sales.

Sulthan

Starring Karthi in the lead role, the film further aided the box office recovery in Tamil Nadu. It faced stiff competition from major Hollywood tentpole Godzilla Vs Kong. The filmmakers have kept the total collection under the wraps. However, the stakeholders in the value chain appreciate the film for sustaining a strong momentum at the box office windows.

Karnan

Dhanush was sort of relentless in bringing this movie to the theatres as he knew that it would add to the recovery of the theatre business. And he was right and how. Written and directed by Mari Selvaraj, the film opened to houseful shows and glowing reviews. On the eve of the film’s release, the Tamil Nadu government withdrew permission for 100 per cent occupancy. And still, the filmmakers went through with the release as planned. Result: the film reportedly earned an impressive Rs 23 crore on its opening weekend. In its second week, the film’s gross is pegged close to Rs 40 crore. While the producers have refrained from sharing the collection figures, they have simply declared the film a “blockbuster.”

Jathi Ratnalu

Telugu film patrons continued to surprise everyone by thronging the cinema halls week after week. Do you think only big hero films could salvage the box office? Think again. This small-budget film starring a not-so-big star cast, made a dent at the box office. The film grossed a whopping Rs 70 crore, netting Rs 40 crore profits for its producers.

Uppena

Written and directed by Buchi Babu Sana, the film marked the acting debut of Panja Vaisshnav Tej and Krithi Shetty. A story about a star-crossed lover and the evils of caste pride, it had Vijay Sethupathi playing the main antagonist. Released during Valentine’s week, the film exceeded the expectations in terms of theatrical collection. As per the trade experts, the film’s gross collection has touched Rs 100 crore, earning a net profit of about Rs 57 crore for its producers.

Vakeel Saab

The film set the cash registers ringing at the box office across the Telugu states. If the second wave hadn’t worsened, the film was well on its way to set a new record collection record for a Telugu film that was released in the middle of a pandemic. It raked in about Rs 100 crore in its first week. However, the night curfew in Telangana and the closure of theatres in the state owing to the curbs have massively affected its business. The trade believes that the film will add another Rs 20 crore to its kitty before it ends its theatrical run.

The Priest

Malayalam superstar Mammootty’s horror-thriller opened in cinemas at a time when the theatre business was gasping for new content to stay afloat in Kerala. The film surprised everyone by drawing the family crowd out of their house. Written and directed by Jofin T. Chacko, the film earned more than Rs 16 crore from ticket sales worldwide.

Roberrt

Starring Darshan in the lead, this textbook crowd-pleaser revived the box office business in all corners of Karnataka. Despite the growing concerns of Covid-19, the fans gave the film a rousing welcome at the box office. If the reports are to be believed, the film minted Rs 60 crore within the first four days of its release."

Filmmaker Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari has been working to bring the story of real-life couple, Infosys co-founder NR Narayana Murthy and author Sudha Murthy to the screen for months, and says it is not just a film but a life experience. She spent most of last year’s coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown penning the film, with Shreyas Jain, Piyush Gupta and filmmaker husband, director Nitesh Tiwari attached as co-writers.

In an interview with PTI, Iyer Tiwari said getting familiar with the story of the Murthys has left a deep impact on her personally.

“Working on the life story of Mr Narayan Murthy and Mrs Sudha Murthy has been a learning for life. Their story also makes you think about your priorities and what’s your purpose in life apart from the work you do. It’s not a movie, it’s a life experience and I know deep in my heart this will be my most challenging and cherished film for life,” the director said.

The team is currently in the finishing stages of writing the screenplay with an aim to start shooting soon. But before that, the director of acclaimed dramas like Nil Battey Sannata, Bareily Ki Barfi and Panga, would also deep dive into her OTT debut Faadu.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (@ashwinyiyertiwari)

Iyer Tiwari said she is “jamming on the screenplay” with writer Saumya Joshi for the SonyLIV Original, billed as an “intense love story.”

The filmmaker will get into assembling her team and planning for the pre-production in May, waiting it out for the situation to become safe again for shooting, which is currently halted in Maharashtra due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.

“We will be working from our homes, thanks to the internet and training in work from home this past year. Also, our learning from this pandemic is to keep doing your work and be ready to go on the floor when the time is right and everyone feels it’s a normal, bright day once again.”

The pandemic crisis in the country has also pushed the launch of the filmmaker’s debut fiction novel, “Mapping Love”, which was due next month. While Iyer Tiwari was eager to share the book and her joy with the world, the director wondered if there would be any happiness when “we see ourselves and our loved ones are not in a good space?”

“How do you celebrate your happiness when a surprise treacherous virus has hit our lives. Hoping that everything will become alright and we will see brighter days than just normal days. I would like to celebrate my debut launch as an author with everybody who loves to read, with my mother, my aunts and uncle, my friends and everyone who celebrate the process of creating all kind of art forms. Till then we pray for everyone and heal,” she added.

On Thursday, the 41-year-old filmmaker completed five years of her feature directorial debut Nil Battey Sannata.

Headlined by Swara Bhasker, the film set off Iyer Tiwari’s Bollywood journey of chronicling stories of women from small-town fighting for their right to dream and love– as was seen even in her other two features Bareily Ki Barfi and Panga.

The director said her biggest takeaway in these five years in the industry has been to not take any opportunity to create art for granted. It also made the director realise that filmmaking—which she described as an extension of her passion for storytelling—was not just one person’s medium.

“The journey of movies or any form of medium of telling stories is a long one for creators where everything has to sync in, from the script to actors coming on board to production, marketing, distribution, and an audience reaction. It’s a cumulative effort of a chain of humans like a relay race who believe in the one idea that you have and make it happen with diligence,” she added."

186,Radhe Your Most Wanted Bhai trailer: Salman Khan’s Eid offering takes us back to Wanted and Dabangg,"Salman Khan-starrer Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai trailer is finally here. Directed by Prabhu Deva, the film is an actioner and also features Disha Patani, Randeep Hooda, Jackie Shroff and Megha Akash in pivotal roles. Salman plays the titular role of Radhe who is a cop.

In the film, Salman plays a cop, who works in his own style. This basically means he an “encounter” specialist, that Indian euphemism for cops who are fond of extra-judicial killings. This is your typical Salman film, for better or worse. He plays a larger-than-life character and mouths off bravado-laced one-liners that will, we hope, make sense to Bhai’s fans. It establishes the kind of film Radhe is — a throwback to the naughts — with its feel of Wanted and dialogues from Dabangg further establishing its mood.

Expect a lot of action, some dhuaandhaar dialogues that Bhai’s fans have come to expect from him and dance numbers with film’s leading lady Disha Patani and Jacqueline Fernandez in a cameo.

Watch Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai trailer here

Needless to say, the trailer was worth the wait and Bhai’s fans are going to be ecstatic after watching it and eager to watch the movie. The clip is full of exciting action that should more than satisfy fans of the genre.

Earlier, the makers had announced that the movie will be releasing in theatres on May 13 as well as on ZEE5’s pay per view medium ZeePlex on the same day. This makes the film the first Hindi film to be released simultaneously on multiple platforms.

Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai will also be available to watch on DTH services, including Dish TV, D2H, Tata Sky and Airtel Digital TV.

We have been treated with posters of the movie. A brand new poster of the movie had been shared by Salman Khan ahead of trailer launch as he reassured his fans that the trailer for the film will release at 11 am and not late at night. “Aa raha hoon, Your most wanted bhai! #RadheTrailer ke saath at 11am, today. .. AM ka matlab hai ‘Ante meridiem’ yani gyarah baje subah!” The poster is very reminiscent of the 2009 movie Wanted, which was also directed by Prabhudheva."
186,Vijay Sethupathi announces release date for Laabam as Tughlaq Durbar goes the OTT way,"Filmmaker Pa Ranjith on Thursday released a song from the upcoming film Laabam. And with the song, the filmmakers also revealed its release date. “The film will release on Ramzan! (sic),” tweeted Vijay Sethupathi, who is playing the lead role in Laabam.

The song titled Yaamili Yaamiliyaa was released as a tribute to the film’s director, SP Jhananathan, who passed away earlier this year. The National Award-winning filmmaker fell unconscious at his residence in Chennai in March this year. After he was rushed to the hospital, the doctors found out that he had blood clots in his brain. On March 13, he died of cardiac arrest while he was still under medical care.

Jhananathan had carved a niche for himself in the industry by making socially conscious films that reflect on the evils of an unequal and casteist society. Judging by the trailer released earlier, Laabam also revolves around pressing social issues. The director’s other notable works include the 2006 film E and the 2009 film Peranmai.

Laabam was SP Jhananathan’s second film with Vijay Sethupathi after Purampokku Engira Podhuvudamai in 2015. Billed as a geopolitical drama, the film stars Shruti Haasan, Sai Dhanshika, Kalaiyarasan, Ramesh Thilak, Prithivi Rajan, Danial Anne Pope, Nithish Veera and Jai Varman.

It seems the release date of Laabam was announced to allay the concerns of distributors and exhibitors in Tamil Nadu. Vijay Sethupathi perhaps hopes the promise to release Laabam in theatres next month would soften the blow when the direct OTT release of his other film is announced officially.

According to reports, the makers of his upcoming political satire Tughlaq Durbar have sold the film to Disney Plus Hotstar as they want to skip its theatrical release owing to the new Covid-19 lockdown rules."
187,"#OneYearOfMissingIrrfan: Meghna Gulzar: Irrfan sir’s questioning mind has stayed with me, I hope I can emulate it","From whatever I understand and know of him, Irrfan sir’s philosophy and nature was to keep things simple and unassuming. He always remained rooted and identified with his roots, no matter where he travelled and what work he did. Whether he was doing an international or an Indian film, commercial mainstream or independent film or any other, he was intensely rooted to the person he was. That is the most special and endearing thing about him that everyone will remember him for.I was tremendously in awe of him. I got the opportunity to work with him at a time when my career was not flying high and he was an extremely celebrated actor, well known for his craft. For him to put his trust in me as a director and agree to do my film will be the most cherished moments of my life and career. Talvar was a rebirth for me as a filmmaker, and Irrfan sir being in the film was a big part of that. Apart from that, when we collaborated on Talvar, the relationship we shared was precious, it was extremely professional. It was a tricky subject. Not just as an actor, but even while discussing the case, he would throw questions at me, making me constantly question the knowledge I had and not get complacent at any given point – even though the script was locked and we were shooting. The way his mind worked, and therefore forced my mind to work and to question the alternative, was a precious learning experience for me.I can’t say consciously which part of his personality rubbed off. Unfortunately, our conversations and our equation was limited to working on the film. There was no off-the-set equation with him, not because of anything else, but the sheer regard and awe I felt. I could never think I could have a friendly dinner or a heart-to-heart with him. What has stayed back with me is his questioning mind which I hope I can emulate when the time comes.I met Irrfan sir on and off on my father’s ( Gulzar ) set when he was playing a part in an episode of Kirdaar. I met him in Vishal (Bhardwaj) sir’s office intermittently. But the first one-on-one conversation I had with him was when I met him at his home for the first time after we had given him the script of Talvar. We spoke about the case; he asked me for my perspective and I asked him for his. It’s ironic that he went through the film, played the CBI investigator and till date, I don’t know what his stand on the narrative, the case is. I know he was proud of the work we had done and the product we had put out, but what was going on in his mind is still a mystery to me. And there was so much going on inside but it all looked simple when he executed it on screen. That is where the unassuming part comes into play. There was so much nuance and understudy that went into every role and when he performed, you could not say he was acting. The performance was natural, so much so that it made you believe this is how he laughs, gets angry or cries. That’s the facet of him being unassuming as a person but there was serious hard work that went behind the small gestures, the twitches, the casual one-liners or repartees. It never came off the cuff. It all looked effortless and natural when it came out and one could never call it a performance. But it took a lot of research, deep thinking for him. That is what is special about him."

Amid the Maharashtra lockdown, which has halted shoot, the team is dependent on the re-shot episodes. The producer, Asit Kumarr Modi, however, is open to the idea of moving outdoors for shoot if needed.

In an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, the creator of the longest running sitcom said that the show already has a bank of episode till May 3, and would decide on the future course in accordance to the state government’s next orders.

“We have kept the option of moving outdoors, however, our highest priority is everyone’s safety. Also, in these challenging times, we wish to reiterate what Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has taught us through all these years — spread laughter and positivity even in times of adversity,” he said, adding that even before the shoots were halted, the team’s primary focus was to keep everyone safe. “While work is important, health has become a priority in the last year. This is like a new life that has been given to us, and one has to keep it safe. We are also including real life situations and happenings in our storyline so that the audience also follows all protocols and stays safe,” shared Asit Kumarr Modi.

As he mentioned storyline and audience, we quizzed him on the recent flak the show has received from its fans. A section of the audience had claimed that over the years, the quality of Taarak Mehta had seen a decline. Refuting the same, the producer said that people are going through a tough time, and its getting harder for them to smile.

“I don’t think the show and its stories have degraded. People are in so much stress that they may not find these episodes funny but I am sure when they watch it after a few months, they would have a hearty laugh. Right now, everything is just too grim around us.” Asit Modi also said that the team has been as passionate as it was from day one, and leaves no stones unturned to put out an entertaining episode. “But we are always open to criticism and if people would still feel that we are lacking, we will work hard. I am quite active on social media and also read each feedback and suggestions,” he shared adding that people are also getting restless, and want to see Daya back and Popatal get married.

Disha Vakani, who plays the role of Daya took a maternity leave in 2017, and is yet to get back even when the production has been in constant touch with her. While the buzz in industry suggest that her in-laws want her to focus on her family, others believe that Disha has asked for a mammoth hike.

Trying to evade discussion around her comeback, Asit Kumarr Modi shared that the audience would get to see Daya’s character in Taarak Mehta Ka Chhota Chashmah, the animated version of the sitcom. With a pause, he added, “Honestly, the Covid-19 situation has made things more difficult. As much as the audience, even I want Disha to return as Daya, and I am hopeful she will. All said and done, I am thankful that the audience has been giving us equal love even in her absence, which is quite a boost.”

The footage centres around the two of the most popular characters in the franchise: Scorpion and Sub-Zero. The two characters have an iconic rivalry in video-games. If you want to go into the movie without any spoilers, stop reading.

The scene shows Hiroyuki Sanada’s Hanzo Hasashi or Scorpion with his family. He has a wife, one young boy and a baby girl. He goes to fetch water one day. Joe Taslim’s Bi-Han or Subzero enters his home in his absence and asks his wife about his whereabouts.

Fearing for his family’s safety, Cole goes in search of Sonya Blade at the direction of Jax, a Special Forces Major who bears the same strange dragon marking Cole was born with. Soon, he finds himself at the temple of Lord Raiden, an Elder God and the protector of Earthrealm, who grants sanctuary to those who bear the mark.

Netflix Life has confirmed the return of its hit show Money Heist, along with several other popular titles, in the second half of 2021. The announcement came as fans across the world were awaiting news about Money Heist 5, which was previously expected to arrive in May 2021, but got delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In the Letter to Shareholders in the Q1 earnings report, Netflix confirmed that Money Heist will premiere its fifth and final season in the later half of 2021. Ted Sarandos, co-CEO and Chief Content Officer revealed the same on the company’s investor video for its first-quarter financial results.

Other big shows which were also listed for the fourth quarter of 2021 (October-December) include The Witcher season 2, You season 3, Sex Education season 3, Lost in Space season 3, Cobra Kai season 4 and more. Even feature films like Red Notice and Escape From Spiderhead will release in the second half of 2021.

According to Deadline, Ted Sarandos said in the meeting, “What happened in the first part of this year was that a lot of the projects that we’d hoped to come out earlier did get pushed because of the post-production delays and Covid delays and we think we’ll get back to a much steadier state in the back half of the year, certainly in Q4 where we have the returning seasons of some of our most popular shows like The Witcher and You and Cobra Kai as well as some big tentpole movies that came to market a little slower than we’d hoped like Red Notice and Escape From Spiderhead.”

Red Notice stars Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds. (Photo: Netflix) Red Notice stars Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds. (Photo: Netflix)

Several of these shows were earlier expected for an April-May 2021 release, some due to a pattern maintained by its makers of giving the audience a new season at around the same time every year, and others, because they have already been under production since last year. But the pandemic did hamper the release plans of many.

La Casa De Papel or Money Heist, which was renewed by Netflix for its fifth season in July last year, went on floors in August. And since its fourth season arrived in April 2020, the fifth one was touted for the same time this year. But seems like its production work got delayed, and the show has now been pushed to the later months of 2021.

Another flagship show of Netflix, Stranger Things is set to arrive with its fourth season. Infact, the makers also released a teaser in February 2020, much to the delight of fans. But, the show ditched its summer 2021 release date. It now eyes a premiere either in later 2021 or early 2022. Netflix is yet to confirm on the same."
190,Gauahar Khan slams trolls who asked why she didn’t condole death of Hina Khan’s father: ‘Have some shame’,"Gauahar Khan went live on Instagram last night to chat with her fans. However, the happy conversation soon turned bitter when one of her followers commented that she hadn’t posted a tribute for Hina Khan’s father. Hina’s father passed away on April 20, after suffering a cardiac arrest. Gauahar, who herself lost her father last month, did not take the comment lightly and gave it back to the troll.

As soon as Gauahar read out the question, she looked visibly upset and angry. She first schooled the follower on how one doesn’t need to express all their emotions on social media. Responding to the comment, the actor said, “I am not a fake person to put it out only on social media. What I had to do, I did it. My connection with Hina is from my heart and I don’t need to prove my connection to really silly people like you. So, please keep your negativity to yourself and don’t bring it here. I am an individual and I take my decisions on a personal level. What I feel and how I feel, I react accordingly, and I will always do that .”

Gauahar went on to add angrily, “Thoda sharam karlo yaar, besharam log (Have some shame)! I have her dad in my prayers, her in my prayers, and I don’t need to prove anything to silly people like you, who only live your lives on social media and think just by putting a condolence on social media, you are feeling something, that’s not true. When you feel, you feel. And, when you feel, you reach out to the person. You don’t have to prove it to the ‘janta’ (public), understand.. This just makes me so angry.”

Gauahar Khan and Hina Khan last year entered Bigg Boss 14 as part of the ‘Toofani Senior’ gang. Both of them bonded quite well on the show and were inseparable in the house. While Gauahar previously won the seventh season, Hina has been the runner up of Bigg Boss 11.

Angry about being judged by nameless trolls, Gauahar further shared how people raised fingers at her for posting photos and videos of herself after her father’s death. Calling them sick, the Ishaqzaade actor said, “I lost my dad a month and a half ago and people were so quick to judge. ‘Oh, you are already posting stuff. You are already putting pictures and dance videos.’ Do you people even know what it takes to get over a loss? Do you know that a person doesn’t need to sit like this and wonder ‘Oh my God, I am losing somebody.’ You can’t do that.”

She also reasoned her religious beliefs on the importance of moving on as she added, “In Islam, you can’t grieve for more than three days. You can’t cry and be in sadness for more than three days. You have to move on, you have to live your life, you have to carry on with the love of the person that you’ve lost. So, you keep your judgements to yourself and let people be, the way they want to heal, the way they want to come out of things, the way they want to function, stop judging people. Live and let live.”

Gauahar Khan shared that she wanted the live interaction to be a light and lovely one, however, that one comment got her fuming. Her fans soon tried to cheer her up by sending her love and positive messages, which definitely worked, as she got at replying to them with a smile.

On the work front, Gauahar was last seen in Tandav, and recently wrapped up production of her next, an anthology series Kaali Peeli Tales. The actor got married last year in December to actor-choreographer Zaid Darbar."

To this, Varun was quick to clarify that he was returning from his professional assignment. “Well, your assumption is wrong. I was shooting my film and not on holiday. And what do you mean ‘Gave them a chance?’ How do you not give them a chance? I have people who have also lost their life in covid. So please keep you assumptions to yourself,” the actor wrote.

Varun Dhawan lost his aunt last year due to Covid-19 related complications in the US.

On the work front, Varun was last seen in his father, David Dhawan’s directorial Coolie No. 1 with Sara Ali Khan.

But yes, if I see the intent of the team, if they respect my worth, value me and genuinely can’t afford to pay my fees, I am not too bothered by it.”"

206,Activists urge villagers to oppose stone crusher unit,"The site is a stone’s throw from a water body and in the midst of fields

Activists urged residents of Sundarayyapeta panchayat to oppose the establishment of a stone crushing unit that is coming up within 364 m of a lake in their village.

Sundarayyapeta panchayat is located in Kasimkota tehsil, 19 km from Anakapalle.

The lake, which is known as Raju Gari Cheruvu, is the main source of irrigation for farmers in Sundarayyapeta, Atchiyyapeta and Mondipalem villages. The area where work is being done to set up the stone crusher unit is in the midst of agricultural fields and casuarina groves, and is a stone’s throw from the water body.

Representatives of the All India Youth Forum (AIYF), A.P. Rythu Sangham, and All India Agricultural and Rural Labour Association (AIARLA) have appealed to the villagers not to allow the establishment of the unit, on the grounds that the dust generated would contaminate the water in the lake and destroy crops over a period of time.

“A new panchayat road was laid from Sampathipuram to Venkupalem. It was built recently under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. This road will be destroyed within two years if heavy trucks ply on it. Anakapalle will be made a district headquarters sooner or later once a separate district is carved out of Visakhapatnam district. It should be protected from pollution for the benefit of posterity,” an activist said.

The activists alleged that those who were setting up the stone crusher unit were violating environmental rules in the absence of resistance from the local people. The wondered whether the approval of the gram panchayat was taken, and whether a gram sabha and a public hearing were conducted as per statutory requirements.

They called upon the local people to act before it was too late and submit a representation to the Joint Action Committee (JAC) to fight for justice to the villagers."

206,"Severe action against hospitals flouting norms, warns Collector","‘CM keen on providing free treatment to poor’

District Collector V. Vinay Chand has warned private hospitals of severe legal action if they violate orders issued by the State government.

At a review meeting with managements and coordinators of COVID-19 empanelled private hospitals, Mr. Vinay Chand said that a notification was issued by the government on Thursday categorising 40 private hospitals into ‘A’ and ‘B’.

He called upon the empanelled private hospitals to utilise the experience gained by them last year to provide better services to COVID-19 patients in view of the second wave surge. The Chief Minister was keen on providing free COVID treatment to poor patients, he said.

The Chief Minister had expressed his displeasure at some private hospitals turning away COVID patients, despite the availability of beds. He wanted hospitals indulging in such activities to be closed. The Collector said that health workers were given priority in vaccination and they should now render better services without any fear and work with dedication.

Mr. Vinay Chand said that hospitals should not demand any deposit from the patients. They would be reimbursed by the government as per the rates decided in the past. He also directed that help-desks should be opened at the entrance of the hospitals to provide information to the patients and their relatives.

CCTV cameras should be installed in all the wards and the footage should be sent to the Collectorate and the State COVID Centre from time to time. Private hospitals should get the fire safety audit done, the Collector instructed.

Joint Collectors P. Arun Babu and R. Govinda Rao, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana, DM&HO P. Suryanarayana, AMC Principal P.V. Sudhakar and ZP CEO Nagarjuna Sagar were among those who attended."
207,Glitches in CoWIN hold up second dose for many,"Heavy rush at session sites due to increased awareness on vaccines

Glitches in the functioning of the CoWIN app foiled the plans of the district administration to smoothly execute the administration of the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine (both Covishield and Covaxin) here on Thursday.

“Registration for the second dose was supposed to begin at 7.30 a.m., and we reached the session site at Swarna Bharati Indoor Stadium at 6.30 a.m. However, the app did not function till 10.30.a.m.,” a government employee said. She said the vaccines reached the centre at around 9.30 a.m., at least two hours behind schedule, and that she had to wait for almost six hours to get the jab.

Many complained that the drive was not organised systematically and people, including senior citizens, had to wait for long hours for the inoculation.

“The idea to have a special drive exclusively for those taking the second dose was good. However, the planning left a lot to be desired. Due to the rush of people and lack of social distancing norms, many like me got scared and left the venue,” a senior professor from Andhra University said.

Authorities should deploy more police personnel, increase the number of registration counters, deploy more staff on the ground both for vaccinating and checking the post-vaccination status and focus on better functioning of computers and apps, said a senior citizen who had to wait for three hours for the second jab, at a centre in China Waltair.

More vaccines to come

To meet the demands of people who were due for their second dose, the district received nearly 40,000 doses, including 32,000 Covishield vials, and had organised a special drive.

“For administering Covishield, we have opened up 180 vaccine centres, including all PHCs, across the district. For Covaxin, we had opened up seven exclusive centres,” Collector V. Vinay Chand said.

According to him, the flow of vaccines is now being done in batches varying from 30,000 to 50,000 doses and the best way for mass vaccination is by organising drives.

It is learnt that the district will be receiving 50,000 doses by Saturday, and another vaccination drive for people aged above 45 (first timers) will be organised.

A senior officer from the district administration said that awareness on vaccines has picked up which is leading to a rush at session sites. “We are working to streamline the systems to avoid delays,” he said."
207,"Scared of uncertain future,elderly people turn to temples","Worried over the worsening second wave of pandemic, they find solace in bhajans and puranas

Valli Mutthu (67) of Nagari municipality had lost her job at half a dozen households as a maid during the lockdown induced by coronavirus last year. She just resumed her work in a few houses in November last year, after the infection started subsiding and the situation eased a little.

Before she could put her life in order, Ms. Valli Mutthu lost her jobs again as the second wave of the pandemic came in the first week of April.

The spurt in COVID cases has left many elderly people a bundle of nerves. Scared of their uncertain future, they find themselves a mere spent force and turn to listening to bhajans and puranas for solace.

Reports of those died of the virus getting ‘orphan-like’ funeral by the staff of the civic bodies, shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and blackmarketing of life-saving drugs and hefty hospital bills have left them shaken.

Many of the elderly people are now seen at local temples, offering prayers, and spending time by doing bhajans and listening to puranas. Such scenes are become common in suburban areas along the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border, which is reeling under the impact of the second wave.

“I came to Nagari from Chennai three decades ago after my husband’s death. The families who knew me well now find me a pariah. They think I am a potential carrier of the virus. I find solace in small temples now. I eat whatever little I can find once or twice a day. I spend time by listening to bhajans and religious discourses,” she says.

Parameshwaraiah (72), who retired as a peon of a government office in Puttur says he has none to turn to in case of any emergency.

“After my wife’s death a decade ago, I have been treated as a burden by his son’s family. I have to give away a big chunk of my pension to them. They don’t talk to me much. I am vexed with life. I find several likes of me visiting temples and praying. I join them. We chit chats on puranas and the latest news on the pandemic,” he says."
208,"10th, Inter exams being held to avoid problems for students: Minister","Lokesh trying to create fear psychosis among students, says Suresh

Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh on Thursday took objection to the TDP leader Nara Lokesh’s criticism of the government decision to go ahead with the conduct of the 10th Class and Intermediate exams.

At a press conference, Mr. Suresh said a lot of thought had gone into the decision to hold the examinations. Last year, the students who had lost their academic year had been facing serious academic problems due to the government’s inability to conduct 10th class exams. “We did not want a repeat of the situation this year,” said the Minister.

Mr. Suresh also objected to the language used by the TDP leader against the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. He said the student community in the State was happy with the welfare schemes introduced by the government as part of reforms in the education sector. As a result, government schools had witnessed nearly 4.5 lakh additional enrolments this academic year.

The Minister accused Mr. Lokesh of trying to create a fear psychosis among students and their parents by making exaggerated statements that 70 lakh students would contract the virus if the examinations were conducted.

He said the government was sensitive to the problems of students in these difficult times and it had been doing all it could to ensure their health safety even while trying to reach out to them and impart lessons in some mode or the other.

Last year also, the department could conduct 10th class exams but was forced to cancel the supplementary tests in view of the rapid spread of the virus.

Explaining the measures initiated by the government for the safety of the student community, the Minister said it was unfair on the part of the TDP leader to sit in Hyderabad and criticise the government here.

The Minister said COVID protocol was being strictly followed in the government schools and colleges but there were reports of violations in some private educational institutions. He said managements of such institutions would be punished.

He said students should exercise patience and confine themselves to indoors normalcy returns."
208,Atchannaidu seeks govt. aid for pvt. school teachers,"TDP leader accuses govt. of ignoring their plight

TDP State president Kinjarapu Atchannaidu has written a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy alleging the government’s ‘negligence towards private school teachers in providing them with a COVID relief package’.

In the letter on Thursday, Mr. Atchannaidu said that the private teachers and non-teaching staff who had lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic should be supported by giving a monthly stipend of ₹10,000. He also appealed to the government to provide interest-free loan from banks and employment opportunities in the form of outsourced staff in public sector companies.

As schools were closed many private school teachers were facing difficulties due to lack of salaries. Some of them had become vegetable sellers, cobblers and construction workers to make a living. The government had failed miserably in supporting them, he said.

“It is unfortunate that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy lacks focus on education system. Telangana government distributes 25 kg of rice along with ₹2,000 a month to support private teachers. Other States are also aiding them in some way. But in A.P., Mr. Jagan is acting as if nothing has happened,” Mr. Atchannaidu said."

223,1- cr doses of Covishield purchase gets nod,"BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa, hours after being discharged from the hospital, approved the purchase of one crore doses of Covishield vaccine, which will be administered to people between 18-44 age group.However, a decision on whether the doses will be given free of cost or not is yet to be taken.On Thursday evening, CM Yediyurappaâs office released a statement citing that Rs 400 crore has been allocated from the state exchequer for the purchase of one crore doses, after the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) priced it at Rs 400 per dose for state governments for direct purchase.The decision will have to be ratified by the state cabinet, whose meeting has been scheduled for April 26.But even as states like Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Kerala and others declared that they will administer the vaccine doses free of cost, Karnataka is yet to decide on its policy.âWe will have to consider the decision only after consulting the CM. A decision will be conveyed in the next couple of days after meeting the CM,â said health minister K Sudhakar.Earlier, amid rising cases of Covid-19, chief minister B S Yediyurappa was discharged on Thursday from Manipal hospital after testing negative for infection.Admitted on April 16 after testing positive at another private hospital-- M S Ramaiah Foundation hospital-- the CM was sent to Manipal hospital.However, with no severity recorded in his health conditions, Yediyurappa was under observation with medications being administered to him.The CM, after a week, was finally tested again on Wednesday and was discharged.This is the second time that Yediyurappa has contracted Covid-19 infection and has been discharged with no major symptomatic conditions.The CM was admitted the first time on August 2 at the same hospital and was discharged on August 10.Yediyurappa also held a review meeting of the Covid-19 measures taken by the government in his absence in Bengaluru and asked the officials to tighten the situation on the streets by enforcing strict curfew measures.âHaving been in hospital for a week, the meeting was to review the cases and the action initiated by the state,â said CMO officials."
223,BBMP pushes for integrated booking system,"Dry run of the system on Friday with plans to launch it soon: PHANA

Priya S. (name changed), a resident of Banaswadi, recalled the helplessness of trying to find an ICU bed for her husband whose oxygen saturation levels were dropping at alarming levels due to COVID-19.

As they rode in the ambulance knocking on the doors of hospitals, her husband’s oxygen saturation levels dropped to 54. “I did call the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) helpline and there were no ICU beds available in the government quota. So, I took him in an ambulance and went searching for a bed. The ordeal lasted three hours,” she said.

With the clamour for hospital beds only increasing by the day, the BBMP is pushing for a common platform and booking system to be put in place that will allow people to monitor and book beds in the private quota as well.

This will bring more transparency to a system that citizens allege is opaque. Such a system already exists for beds available under government quota. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, BBMP’s Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, “A common booking system may help COVID-19 patients and prevent them from going to multiple hospitals in search of beds. This has been discussed in high-level meetings with the State government.”

However, BBMP sources said there was some resistance from private hospitals in putting such a system in place.

However, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA) president Prasanna H.M. said the bed management system for private quota was in the process of being readied. “We wanted to have this in place last year itself. But dropped the idea after the number of cases came down. We will now have a dry run of the system on Friday and launch it soon,” he said.

An integration of the existing system and a platform for private quota beds is the need of the hour, said officials. It is a system that may ease the trauma of finding a bed for their loved ones.

Software engineer Shubha Rao called over 30 private hospitals after her colleague’s father-in-law tested positive with low oxygen saturation and was in need of an ICU bed.

“We finally got a bed in a small hospital that I didn’t even know existed. Most people turn to big hospitals. There is a need for a centralised database of beds available under the government and private quota that is updated in real time,” she said.

The BBMP is coordinating with various private hospitals towards making a total of 11,000 beds available over the next two to three days. The State government too has directed all private hospitals and medical colleges to hand over 80% of beds in their facilities to the government.

Mr. Gupta acknowledged the limited number of ICU beds in the city. The 600 ICU beds that had been handed over had already been allotted under the BBMP’s hospital bed management system.

“As and when there is an availability, ICU beds are being allotted. Towards increasing the number of ICU beds, we have held discussions with private medical colleges and private hospitals. The total may increase by another 200,” he stated.

At the government level, initiative is being taken to establish ICU temporary hospitals. “If this is done, an additional 1,000 ICU beds may be available,” he added.

He urged citizens not to panic, and stated that nearly 90% of those who test positive do not require any serious medical interventions.

Care centres

The BBMP will have in place 12 COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) for those who don’t have the wherewithal to isolate themselves at home, said Mr. Gupta.

Apart from these facilities, step down hospital and private CCCs with certain medical facilities are being established by private hospitals in association with hotels."

The spike in covid deaths in the city has led to longoutside crematoria, and long waiting hours., who have been performing last rites for covid patients since the onset of the pandemic, are now planning to let thehandle thehave started asking family members to take the bodies within 16 hours of death and the attenders are finding it very difficult to find slots for cremations. Prateek (name changed) told Bangalore Mirror about his ordeal after his 29-year-old friend died of covid on Tuesday evening at a private hospital he had been shifted to just an hour before his death.“Hardly 12 hours had gone by and the hospital began calling me up, asking me to take the body as it has started to decompose. On Wednesday early morning, I had to rush to the hospital and make arrangements for the cremation, which was again a huge task as it was not easy to get slots in the. With the help of a few volunteers fromwho agreed to do it, we managed to do his last rites on Wednesday afternoon,” he said.from Mercy Mission said that the long queues at the crematorium are taking most of their time as they end up waiting for hours outside the crematorium. “Due to fasting, most of the volunteers would be tired by the end of the day, as we finish burials and even take up cremations on the same day where we end up waiting for hours. With night curfew in place, we won’t get anything to eat as well and we too cannot eat in that state while waiting outside the crematoriums. On Tuesday night, we were waiting for our slot outside thecrematorium and got done at 2:30 am on Wednesday. It’s becoming difficult for us to spend so many hours on cremation so we are planning to stop attending to cremations and direct them to BBMP,” he said.Another volunteer from Mercy Mission said that they are trying as much as possible to direct all cremations to BBMP and take up burials. He said, “There were five cremations for covid and recently two more were included but even those two are overloaded. Each crematorium has only two machines and some often break down due to overload. It takes a lot of time for the staff to repair the machine and resume work. As the number of deaths is increasing, the government should do something to solve the issue.”An official from BBMP said that they have been assisting the NGOs and volunteer groups since the beginning and they will ask the staff to take up more cremations and let the groups handle the burials."

MANGALURU: Even as the migrant labourers working in various construction sites and industries in Dakshina Kannada district were found rushing to their hometowns after new restrictions were imposed in the state in view of Covid-19 pandemic, the district administration has appealed them not to leave the region in panic.

Deputy commissioner Dr KV Rajendra appealed to migrant labourers not to leave the district.

He said a meeting of representatives from the Confederation of Real Estate Developersâ Association of India (CREDAI), Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) and contractorsâ association was held on Thursday to discuss the issue.

âThe district administration has directed all developers and contractors to take care of migrant labourersâ daily needs. Hence, they should not panic and leave the district. They should continue to work in the district,â the DC said.

225,Assistance for elderly a must during pandemic: Karnataka high court,"BENGALURU: The high court on Wednesday directed the state government to issue circulars to ensure timely assistance and relief for elderly citizens during the prevailing pandemic . The government is also required to ensure that all eligible old age pensioners get their pension regularly.The direction issued by a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka said circulars have to be issued to all district magistrates to perform their duty under Section 20 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act , 2007 and Karnataka Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Rules, 2009, by prescribing a comprehensive action plan for senior citizens.Section 20 earmarks medical facilities, including treatment and beds, for senior citizens in government hospitals and private hospitals receiving government funding.âIn the context of the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, the state government will have to make every possible endeavour to comply with section 20 of the said Act, especially at Covid Care Centres and Covid hospitals. The state will issue an advisory to all concerned to keep in mind the mandate of Section 20 while running Covid centres and hospitals,â the bench said.The next hearing on two separate PILs seeking enhanced pension and mediclaim policies for the elderly is slated for June 18."
225,"Bengaluru: As deaths mount, wait to perform rites lengthens","Shortage of vehicles

BENGALURU: Already struggling to come to terms with the sudden demise of Radha (name changed) to Covid-19, her family had to wait more than 10 hours in a serpentine queue of ambulances outside a crematorium in Bengaluru to complete her last rites.Radha, who was in her 50s, succumbed on Tuesday and her body was shifted from Columbia Asia Hospital at 4pm with the help of volunteers from Mercy Angels , the notfor-profit organisation. Tanveer Ahmed of Mercy Angels, who was with the family from 4 pm till they completed the rites at around 2am, told TOI they had decided on the Kudlu Gate crematorium as he had seen only a few people there a day earlier.But when they reached the crematorium on Tuesday, they were in for a rude shock. âThere were 15 vehicles ahead of us and many more joined up behind us shortly later. After a point, the workers had to close the gates and ask approaching vehicles to go elsewhere,â Ahmed said. âBy the time we completed the rites and returned home, it was 3.30am. In all, we spent almost 12 hours to cremate just one body,â he added.Ahmed said the wait to cremate bodies is only increasing by the day. âOne family took the body of a loved one to the Panathur crematorium and waited five hours. They then left and returned the next day at 6am to get the cremation done,â he said. âAnother private ambulance I know of had gone to Sumanahalli crematorium at 12 noon and their turn came only at 11pm,â Ahmed said.Though each crematorium has two furnaces, Ahmed said technical issues cause even more delays. âCrematorium workers are overburdened, and I have seen their workload increase in the past few weeks. In fact, I had formed a bond with them in the past year. Lately, they are so busy that they are unable to receive or return my calls,â he said.He said some people also pull strings and jump the queue, which only adds to the waiting time and the frustration of other bereaved families. Sadiq Hussain , another Mercy Angel volunteer, has helped with 400-500 cremations and burials in the past year. He said the long wait at crematoria is like rubbing salt on peopleâs wounds. He says the reasons for the long queue are the increase in the number of deaths and pressure on crematoriums. âIt takes a minimum of one hour, sometimes 90 minutes, to burn one body,â Hussain said.It is not just the wait outside crematoria that is bothering bereaved family members. They also have to wait to find a vehicle to transport bodies from hospital to crematoria. Hussain said it is because of limited vehicles and an exponential number of deaths.âIn addition, each vehicle is stuck at the crematorium for six to seven hours, creating an additional shortage,â he said, adding that he witnessed a man searching for a vehicle to carry a body from 8am to 2pm near a hospital in the city.âEvery day I see people going through such immense pain and hassle,â Hussain said. âFrom the lengthy procedure to release bodies at hospitals to massive queues at crematoria. What we do is service, but there needs to be some support and intervention from the government.âAhmed said one solution is to create temporary crematoria to take the load."
225,Bengaluru: Staff crunch sees Covid doctors do double shifts,"BENGALURU: Their endurance stretched to near breaking point, a handful of doctors at Yelahanka General Hospital in Bengaluru have beseeched fellow medical experts working in NGOs for help as they battle to treat 33 Covid-19 patients , all with moderate to severe forms of the disease.The Covid-19 ward has only five doctors who work more than 12-hour shifts. Ideally the hospital should have had a minimum 12 doctors working in three-shifts.âWe have been having a rough time,â admitted a duty doctor. âWe not only must treat ill patients, but also diagnose walk-in patients. In between walk-ins and constantly checking parameters of in-patients, we must communicate with patientsâ relatives â all this wearing PPE. It leaves us dehydrated within an hour, adding to the stress.âEach doctor wears three sets of PPE a day. The breaks between changing PPE is also used to complete paperwork and have meals. Six nurses share the Covid ward workload with the five doctors. A weekly off is a luxury, the staffers said.With about a dozen patients needing oxygen, hospital staff also must monitor oxygen stock. For the past three days, the hospital has been struggling to get oxygen cylinders, doctors said.Due to the acute shortage of key staff, the hospitalâs five ICU beds are not functional. The hospital has an anaesthetist but given the doctorâs age and lack of other skilled human resources, the ICU has remained shut.The hospital sees a minimum 15 walk-ins a day, many of whom have severe symptoms. Some do not have Covid positive certificates or SRF IDs. âIn such cases, we conduct a rapid antigen test to confirm infection. All such patients are first stabilised and since beds are full, we have to coordinate with 108 ambulance helpline and BBMP authorities to shift them to other hospitals,â said a doctor.The doctors also said patients rarely understand limitations like lack of beds and the non-functional ICU. âPatientsâ families do not understand these realities. They only want the person to be admitted,â another doctor said. âFor critical patients who need to be treated on a ventilator, we have to find beds in other hospitals. We are unable to treat such patients in our hospital. The lack of trust among the public in doctors is only adding to our stress.âYelahanka General Hospital is the only government hospital in north Bengaluru treating Covid patients.When contacted, Dr Asma Tabassum, administrative medical officer of the hospital, said higher authorities have been informed of the staff crunch . âIt has been tough for these doctors. We have sought help of the NGO, Doctors For You. They have agreed to depute two doctors soon,â she said."
225,Cops get ready to enforce weekend curfew in Karnataka,"Bengaluru police have around 16,000 personnel, including 5,000 traffic cops. Around 1,500 have been deployed t... Read More

BENGALURU: Night and weekend curfews are set to stretch the resources of the city police force, which is already saddled with the transport strike (now called off) and Covid protocol enforcement. The weekend curfew kicks in on Friday night and will extend till Monday morning.

Deploying staff for other night patrol, law & order and traffic enforcement amid the raging pandemic is a huge challenge for the force of which 216 city policemen have tested positive since April 1.

Police commissioner Kamal Pant admitted the force is under pressure, but asserted they won't let their guard down in day-to-day policing. ""Despite the constraints, we are carrying out our daily duties such as following up on old cases, making arrests, producing suspects in courts and registering FIRs at stations,"" he said, adding: ""Sending teams to other states for probe hasn't been affected. But if positive cases rise and we need more staff for weekend curfew, we may rethink it.""

Bengaluru police have around 16,000 personnel, including 5,000 traffic cops. Around 1,500 have been deployed to enforce mask and social-distancing norms.

The condition of state police is no different from their city counterparts. With night curfew in place, highway patrol police are being deployed at entry and exit points in districts. At least half a dozen highway patrol vehicles monitor national and state highways round the clock. Their services are mostly restricted to checkposts during curfew hours, say police.

""Local police assist us but we have to scan vehicles entering and exiting the district,"" said a senior officer from Tumakuru district, adding: ""Since we are on the Bengaluru border, we get more vehicles entering and exiting the city. We have to check private vehicles in particular.""

Further, patrolling vehicles in towns and rural areas in districts have been directed to set up checkposts on state highways. ""Since the education department has called off exams up to class 10, more families will be travelling to different parts of the state in private vehicles. We have been strictly advised not to allow such vehicles during curfew hours,"" an official attached with another district said.

226,Abrupt end to strike worries many; STUs may not reinstate sacked staff,"BENGALURU: When the four-day transport stir last December brought the government to its knees, there was jubilation among employees of four state transport undertakings. The flash strike paralysed bus services across Karnataka as nearly 1.3 lakh STU staffers rallied behind Kodihalli Chandrashekar , president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha .A majority of the employees who were part of KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation, which is affiliated to AITUC , joined the Chandrashekar-led Karnataka State Road Transport Employees' League. Buoyed by the December protest's response, the league issued a 21-day notice before the April strike seeking implementation of pay revision according to the 6th Pay Commission .However, the notice only gave the transport department ample time to be prepared. It roped in private bus operators and allowed them to run without permits across the state and also opened up government bus terminals to them. The government maintained implementation of the salary revision would translate into a 30% hike, which was not feasible, and offered an 8-10 per cent increase instead. However, it was not acceptable to the union leaders.Some employees alleged union leaders left them in the lurch. ""We should have at least agreed for a 10% hike, but now we are nowhere. They may take stringent action against us once we resume duty,"" rued a BMTC conductor.Transport department officials said they decided not to go for negotiations. ""This is probably for the first time in the history of STUs that an indefinite strike ended without negotiations. They haven't achieved anything. We decided not to succumb to pressure since they were too demanding and arrogant,"" said a senior transport department official.While employees' demand for salary revision was genuine, many felt a strike during a pandemic was untimely. ""We thought they would go for a 3-5-day strike but it lasted 15 days, the longest in the history of STUs in Karnataka. The government was ready to give at least an 8% hike, but they are unlikely to get it now,"" said the official.A union leader said the second Covid wave stumped them. ""We were not allowed to stage protests anywhere, including Freedom Park. Also, the government didn't give March salary to employees. It took action against workers. But we continued till the high court intervened in the matter on Tuesday,"" he added.STUs, meanwhile, gradually scaled up their operations as days passed. ""We have been improving our schedules despite protesters' threats. The strike had fizzled out even before they called it off. This is a setback for both STUs and employees. For the first time, Majestic bus terminuses saw so many private buses. It will also encourage the call for privatisation of transport services,"" said another official."
226,Bengaluru: Loss after loss leaves families in deep shock,"BENGALURU: A family from RT Nagar was at the Indian Christian Cemetery a few days ago to perform the last rites of their 70-year-old matriarch who died of Covid . Even as the grief-stricken relatives trailed out of the burial ground, they received a call that the womanâs daughter too had died of the infection.The second Covid surge appears to be more cruel than the first, with many families reporting the death of young people, mainly in their 30s, and two or three victims from the same family.Last Saturday, a 34-year-old man who worked at a car showroom in Gandhinagar died of Covid-19. âHe was healthy and was living with his wife and mother... He and his colleagues tested positive and he remained in home isolation,â said a relative.He developed chest congestion on Saturday and was rushed to Sparsh Hospital in RR Nagar but he died soon after. His elderly mother, broken after his death, developed breathing difficulties and passed away less than 24 hours after her sonâs last rites, a relative tearfully recalled.Then thereâs hope against hope. A 31-year-old techie from Whitefield infected with Covid was showing signs of recovery and shifted out of the ICU of a private hospital. On Sunday, he developed complications and passed away. He is survived by his wife.(Names of victims withheld on request)"
227,Kaveri struggles with add-ons,"Property registration applications has seen multiple new tasks piled on without any upgrade

The Kaveri application, which has been successful in online property registrations in Karnataka for over a decade-and-a-half, seems to be crumbling under its own weight. While the application on which it has been working has become obsolete, it has seen increased load over the years without any upgrade.

When the system was developed in 2003, Kaveri application was meant to handle just about 10 modules, including document registration, property valuation, marriage registration, encumbrance search, and scanning archives among others. “As it successfully demonstrated its capacity, new tasks were imposed on it. In 17 years, about 20 more tasks that were not originally conceived have been added without any upgrade,” a senior Revenue official told The Hindu.

Almost every day there is some technical issue in one of the integration applications belonging to other departments, which were not part of the original module, he rued.

The Kaveri system that is now critical in the land management system has been witnessing frequent shutdowns in the last few months with at least four reported Statewide shutdowns that brought registrations to a standstill.

Kaveri 1 is running on VB platform and Win XP operating system, both of which do not get the update support of Microsoft since they have become outdated. The decentralised system is further affected since the old hardware and inefficient power back up delays restoration of data due to maintenance efficiency of 282 local servers located in each office.

Sources pointed out apart from the original tasks, Kaveri now supports land related integrations from other departments such as Bhoomi, Mojini, e-Swathu, Upor, e-Aasthi, Sakala, Udyoga Mitra Portal, Khajane II, Moulya, Digilocker, BDA, BBMP, and PAN verification services. “Not much focus is being given to upgrade the application or bring a new system that is robust and can handle newer integrations,” said the source.

Over the last five years, the Stamps and Registrations Department’s transaction in over 280 sub-registrar’s office alone has seen an increase. The number of documents registered has gone up from 19.71 lakh in 2015-2016 to 20.45 lakh in 2019-2020. In the same period, marriage registrations have increased from 1.21 lakh to 1.49 lakh, encumbrance certificates 27.75 lakh to 36.79 lakh, CCs from 6.86 lakh to 8.07 lakh.

Another officer said Kaveri was never meant to be interactive, but made partially interactive in the recent years. “It was meant to bring convenience in registrations. The number of steps used in registrations have gone from about 5 to 22 now. Ambitious plans such as sending OTP to the user during registrations has added pressure. To generate one OTP, the application makes about 15 communications that adds to the stress.”

Why is NIC application not being considered?

A National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) developed by National Informatics Centre is available free of cost for the State struggling with Kaveri.

According to government sources, it has been found that the free property registration related application has been adopted in eight States, and States such as Maharashtra and Telangana are considering it too. Sources said that Karnataka is part of the NGDRS committee, but has so far not considered the application for adoption. “This can be adopted within a month across the State and is expected to provide a permanent solution to the existing problem. Moreover, it is a free application,” said the source. The Centre for Smart Governance has been tasked with developing a new system to handle the existing and future needs. A revenue official said that it may be a year’s time before the new system can go live. “Till then, the daily fire-fighting continues.”"
227,Tension in Gantiganahalli,"Two days after a banner of B.R. Ambedkar, which had been put at the entrance of Gantiganahalli village, was burnt, villages have threatened to stage a massive protest if the police failed to arrest the culprits.

“The banner had been put up to commemorate Ambedkar Jayanti, We have taken up a case, and efforts are on to identify the accused,” said a police officer."

Nandana Ambulance International, situated near Hebbal flyover, agreed but demanded ₹60,000 to be paid immediately. According to the police, his daughter Bhavya, 26, who was struggling to arrange the money, asked the owner to reduce the amount but the driver who had already taken the body threatened to dump it on the road. The owner, Harish Ashwanthnarayana, agreed to ₹16,000 after the family sought the media’s help.

That's what the family of a 55-year-old man realised after they were asked to pay Rs 60,000 by an ambulance driver to preserve his body in a freezer for a night and later organise the funeral.His daughter was on the verge of pledging her gold chain to give him a dignified farewell when police intervened to resolve the issue. RV Prasad, former Bosch employee and resident of Mathikere, fell ill and submitted his swab sample at the primary health centre on Sunday. His nephew Amit said they began checking for hospitals. ""Someone said there was a vacant bed in Kanakapura and we took him there, but in vain. On Monday, we got the BBMP report and BU number too. When we contacted the BBMP helpline to arrange a bed, we were told to wait for some time and they would call back.""Amit added: ""We went through a directory of hospitals to find a bed. Around 5.45pm Tuesday, he fell unconscious. We approached a private operator for an ambulance. For three hours, we tried to get him admitted but failed. By then, he had died and had no other option but to return.""Asked for Rs 6,000, family assumed it was Rs 60,000: Ambulance driverAround 10.30pm, the family gave up and decided to preserve the body for the night and hold the cremation on Wednesday. Ambulance driver Hanumantha offered them a âpackageâ to preserve the body in a freezer and for the cremation the next day.âHe demanded Rs 60,000 and we tried to negotiate â all this on the service road under the flyover in Hebbal. When we requested him to reduce the price, Hanumantha rudely asked us to unload the body. With no option, we paid an advance of Rs 3,000 and asked him to keep the body in the freezer,â Amit said.On Wednesday, Prasadâs daughter Bhavya rushed to Peenya crematorium where Hanumantha had brought the body and paid him Rs 10,000. When she said she was unable to raise the remaining amount, Hanumantha said he would either drop the body at their doorstep or on the road and leave. Bhavya said, âWe decided to pledge my gold. By then, police officials infor med about it came to our rescue and made the ambulance driver see reason.âAmit said they eventually paid Rs 13,000 for the ambulance service. Amit and Bhavya were at Peenya crematorium around 6pm Wednesday. Six hours had elapsed in the queue and Prasadâs body was sixth in line.Hanumantha said he asked for Rs 6,000 and the family assumed it was Rs 60,000. âAs I was wearing a mask, they may have misheard. I asked for Rs 6,000 to ferry the body for five hours,â he said.A person working with an NGO ferrying patients to hospitals and bodies to crematoria said black marketeers are charging Rs 35,000 to transport a body from the hospital, provide a freezer for a night and take care of the last rites in the crematorium.Given the surge in Covid cases and deaths, the demand for ambulances has increased. Some ambulance drivers double as representatives for both crematorium workers and freezer providers and try to make a quick buck, the volunteer said on condition of anonymity."

Narrating the plight of more than 250 metro workers living at Kudlu Gate colony, the reports stated that they are forced to live in a dilapidated building that lacked proper water supply. They live in unhygienic conditions due to non-disposal of garbage. Only four bathrooms have been provided to workers. The report further adds that the area has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes.

Lack of ventilation in rooms and instances of 15-20 people occupying a single room were some of the other conditions highlighted. The report said the BMRCL and its contractors should be held responsible for the lapses and violating labour laws. The BMRCL has been accused of not taking any steps despite being appraised of the poor living conditions of the workers when the pandemic broke out last year.

“Regular health check-ups and vaccination for COVID-19 should be provided to the workers. Most of them work without safety gear and in close proximity with one another. Maintaining social distancing is almost close to impossible given their working conditions at project sites,” the report said.

Maraa demanded formation of a monitoring committee so that it visits colonies of metro workers and evaluate their living conditions and attend to their grievances."
229,"‘When there are no beds, no oxygen…’: Kumaraswamy slams Yediyurappa on full-page govt ads thanking PM for Bengaluru metro","Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former CM H D Kumaraswamy Thursday criticised the B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government for “unnecessary spending” from its treasuries to run front-page advertisements in national and regional dailies, “thanking” PM Modi and the Centre for the recent funding approval for two new phases of Bengaluru metro.

In a video statement recorded from a private hospital in Bengaluru, where he is admitted due to Covid-19, Kumaraswamy, said he was “pained” on seeing the front pages of major Kannada and English dailies on Thursday. “The state government has tried to express gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Centre by spending crores of rupees. The Union Cabinet announcing funds for a development project to a state government should not be considered as bhiksha (charity),” he said.

The JD(S) floor leader in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly then questioned, “What message is the government trying to convey at such a juncture of time when there are no sufficient beds, medical oxygen, and even medicines for the people (suffering from Covid-19).”

He remarked that the expenditure for the advertisement was uncalled for, given the state’s financial constraints.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka unit of the Indian National Congress, in a series of tweets, questioned the timing of the government’s decision to spend on advertisements. With a collage of front pages of major English and Kannada newspapers, the tweet read, “There is no money to honour people battling corona(virus pandemic) in the state. There is no money to meet the demands of transport workers. There is no money for development work as well but how is there enough money to nurture expensive propaganda material.”

At the same time, Lavanya Ballal, Congress’ national social media coordinator, tweeted, “Where did this money come from? Hospitals are running out of oxygen, people are dying due to lack of medicine, crematoriums are running out of space. But Viswa guru has time & money for ads.”

Karnataka reported 23,558 new infections on Wednesday as the active caseload spiked to 1,76,188. With 13,640 new cases, the number of active cases in Bengaluru Urban alone is at 1.25 lakh."
230,"RTCs resume services with 16,000 buses across State","Predict fall in ridership due to restrictions

After operating partially for 15 days due to the strike, the road transport corporations on Thursday ran most of the buses in the fleet – over 16,000. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation ran 4,900 buses in the city, much to the relief of commuters. RTCs said they incurred a revenue loss of over ₹280 crore due to the strike.

Officials predicted that with the rising number of COVID-19 cases and restrictions imposed on occupancy, ridership will fall significantly in the coming days.

“On Thursday, we operated 90% of non–AC bus schedules within the State. But ridership was very low,” said an official with KSRTC. “In the coming days, ridership will drop further, which will impact our revenue generation. We may manage to meet fuel expenses and partial salaries of staff.”

Demand for inter-State buses has also reduced. “Barring Andhra Pradesh, inter-state Services have been badly impacted due to the pandemic. Neighbouring States have imposed strict rules to curb the spread and we are not in a position to run buses as per our schedule,” the official said.

In Bengaluru, passengers were relieved. “The bus strike caused a lot of problems for commuters. As per the government rule, standing in buses is not allowed because of which waiting time has increased at bus stops. The BMTC should have more buses depending on demand,” said Nayana R., a commuter. An official said: “On Thursday, we received reports of some bus crew allowing standing passengers. Instructions have been given to drivers to adhere to the government guidelines.”"
230,‘Can operate 100% bus schedules even after suspension of staff’,"RTCs tell HC this is possible as many AC buses are not in service due to COVID-19

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) on Thursday told the High Court of Karnataka that it can operate 100% bus schedules even after dismissing and suspending some of the employees for resorting to strike as it was not operating a large number of air conditioned buses at present in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Interestingly, while the counsel for the Karnataka State Transport Employees’ League (KSTEL), which had given a call for strike, claimed that over 10,000 employees of road transport corporations (RTCs) have been suspended, the State Advocate-General clarified to the court that only 900 employees had been suspended so far.

Employees stopped

It was also pointed out to the court that four recognised employees’ unions did not give call for the strike but a large number of employees, who wanted to attend to duties, were prevented by those aligned with the newly-registered KSTEL, which is not a recognised trade union by the four State transport corporations.

Meanwhile, while reiterating its earlier observation about the need to resolve the issue, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Suraj Govindaraj adjourned further hearing till April 26 on a batch of PIL petitions questioning the strike and seeking directions to recover loss and damages caused due to it from the organisation that had given call for strike.

Legal remedy

To a query of the Bench on whether the government and the RTCs were willing to keep suspension of employees in abeyance, counsel for the KSRTC said dismissed and suspended employees have a legal remedy in law to appeal against such action, and the decisions taken against the trainee/probationary employees were disciplinary actions.

The KSRTC counsel also pointed out to the Bench that services of several drivers, who were sent on deputation to various other agencies of the government, were taken back to the corporations in view of the strike.

Earlier, the counsel for KSTEL said the strike was against the inhuman treatment of employees as four recognised trade unions had sided with the managements.

Though the employees reported to duty showing deferences to the court’s earlier observations, the Bench said it would keep the petitions pending to ensure that the employees do not resort to strike again in the current scenario and to explore possibility to resolve the issue without coming in the way of prosecution of those resorted to violence."

Meanwhile, Karnataka Revenue Minister R Ashoka announced that the state government has released a total of Rs 571 crore to various district administrations, including Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike(BBMP) , for COVID-19 management due to the surge in the covid cases across the state.

MANGALURU: A video of a dog tied to a motorbike being dragged along a road in Karnataka's Mangaluru city went viral on social media platforms prompting animal rights activist to file a complaint against the accused.

In the video, two men on a motorbike are enjoying their ride as the dog is dragged along the service road in Surathkal area.

The moment the video surfaced, Tauseef Ahmed, the founder of Mr Rescuer, started following the case.

âIt is suspected that the accused are labourers hailing from north Karnataka and staying in a colony in Tadambail in Surathkal. The incident reportedly took place on April 15 and they have left the place as soon as the video went viral. I have interacted with people from the colony. It is saddening to note the three legged dog has probably died. The community dog has been missing since the incident was reported. According to the neighbours, the accused were upset the dog had allegedly bitten one of their children,"" Ahmed said.

Tauseef has also announced a reward of Rs 5,000 to anyone who provides information about the accused.

âWe are trying to check for CCTV footage so that the bike used for the crime is identified. The cruelty towards animals has to end,â he said.

Suma Nayak, an animal rights activist and trustee of Animal Care Trust (ACT), has requested the public on social media to help in bringing the accused to task.

National Environment Care Federation (NECF) secretary Shashidhar Shetty has filed a complaint at the Surathkal police station in connection with the video.

The police said they have been informed about the incident and they are in the process of registering a case.

233,Hanuman Janmbhoomi row: Karnataka may seek archeological survey,"BENGALURU: Karnataka may seek an archeological survey in a bid to prove its claim that the real birthplace of Lord Hanuman is on its land near Hampi and the government is planning to strengthen its proposed project to develop the place as Hanuman Janmbhoomi.

The move comes as a response to the neighbouring state Andhra Pradeshâs claim that Hanuman was born on the hillock Anjanadri in Tirupati. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ) that manages the ancient shrine of Lord Venkateswara declared the place called Japali Theertham on Anjanadri as Hanuman Janmbhoomi on Wednesday on the occasion of Ram Navami following an eight-member expert committee submitted its report.

Dismayed by the development, Karnataka has decided to lay its claim with a renewed vigour that Hanuman was born on the hill also called Anjanadri in Kishkinda near Anegundi in Koppal districts, which abuts the heritage site of Hampi. However, authorities said Karnataka would not prefer confrontation with AP, but wants to settle the issue through consultation based on archaeological and mythological evidence.

""We don't know what made Andhra Pradesh raking up this issue suddenly. This comes at a time when the Karnataka government has embarked on a plan to develop Anjanadri in Kishkinda as a pilgrimage-tourist destination as this is the place that has been authentically identified as Hanumanâs birthplace,â said KS Eswarappa, Karnataka minister for rural development and panchayat raj.

âTirumala is a great pilgrimage centre and there is no dispute about its sthalapurana (ancient history). While we donât want to enter into a dispute with the AP government, we will study the evidence they are providing to prove their argument. We will ask experts to verify it and if needed we will seek a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) on the lines of the Varanasi courtâs decision to settle the matter over Kashi Vishwanath Temple,â Eswarappa added.

Based on many epic and mythological references including that of Ramayana âs chapters Kishkindha Kaand and Sundara Kaand, it was believed from ages that Kishkindha is the place where Ram and Lakshman met Hanuman as they came in search of Sita. It is also believed that Anjanadevi gave birth to Hanuman on a hill in Kishkindha and so the hillock got the name Anjanadri. The TTDâs argument is that Anajanadevi did tapasya in Tirumala, following which Hanuman was born and the hillock thus named Anjanadri and Hanuman later went to Kishkindha.

The stakeholders from both sides, however, hope the issue will be settled amicably since it does not involve religious dispute.

âWe made the declaration based on the available evidence that proves that Anjanadri in Tirumala is Hanumanâs Janmabhoomi and Kishikindha was his karmabhoomi. We will place the records open in the public and it is subjected to discussion,â said TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Redy.

Eswarappa was scheduled to lead a team of ministers- muzrai minister Kota Srinivas Poojari, tourism minister CP Yogeeshwara and Koppal in-charge minister BC Patil- Kishinda on April 16. The plan was to launch the project modernise the Hanuman temple on Anjanadri and develop Kishkinda with the modern tourist amenities. The programme was put off after Pooajri contracted covid.

""The programme will be rescheduled once the covid situation is improved. The plan is on to develop Kishkinda as Hanuman Janmabhoomi,"" said Poojarai.

Hanuman Janmabhoomi in Gokarna too

Ramachandrapura Mutt pontiff Raghaveshwara Bharathi, who is arguing that Hanuman was actually born in a cave near Gokarna in Uttar Kannada district, is holding on to his claim. The pontiff said his mutt will go ahead with its plan on Hanuman Janmabhoomi.

""We have already started renovating the temple in the cave with a cradle to the infant hanuman. The fully-developed Hanuman Janmbhoomi will be inaugurated by the next Ram Navami,â said Raghaveshwara Bharathi.

233,"TTD panel concludes Hanuman born in Jabali, Karnataka wants ASI survey to contest claim","Karnataka says Hanuman was born on Anjeyanadri Hill near Hampi. Karnataka claims reference in Ramayana where it is described as the place where Lord Rama and Laxmana met Lord Hanuman. The hill has a Hanuman temple on the top. (File Photo)

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), based on a report submitted by its expert panel, has made an official announcement Wednesday claiming that Jabali near Akasha Ganga waterfall in Tirumala Hills of Andhra Pradesh was the birthplace of Hanuman. The TTD made the announcement on Rama Navami, even as its earlier claims were contested by Karnataka which has at least two contenders for the claims — one near Hampi and another in Gokarna.

The TTD, which manages shrines including the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh, had formed an expert panel comprising Vedic scholars, archaeologists and an ISRO scientist to study and submit a report pinpointing the actual birthplace of Hanuman.National Sanskrit University Vice-Chancellor V Muralidhara Sharma, one of the member committee, said they established the fact that Tirumala is the birthplace of Hanuman after four months of intensive research. “Based on puranic anthologies, literary scientific and epigraphic evidence, as well geographic details available, Hanuman was born on Anjanadri in Treta Yuga. Rock inscriptions at Srivari temple of 1491 and 1545 CE also mention Anjanadri as the birthplace of Anjaneya,” he said.

TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy said that the TTD would also bring the matter to the notice of both the state and central governments and get ‘Jabali’ officially declared as the birthplace of Hanuman.

Meanwhile, Karnataka says Hanuman was born on Anjeyanadri Hill near Hampi. Karnataka claims reference in Ramayana where it is described as the place where Lord Rama and Laxmana met Lord Hanuman. The hill has a Hanuman temple on the top.

Kota Srinivas Poojary, Karnataka Minister for Hindu Religious Organisations, Endowments and Backward Class Welfare Department, said, “I don’t know how and on what basis the TTD is claiming that Hanuman was born in Andhra. According to Ramayana, which we believe in, it is Anjeyanadri Hill near Hampi which is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman.”

His colleague and Minister for Rural Development and Panchayati Raj KS Eswarappa said the state will now conduct a survey by ASI in Anjeyanadri Hill near Hampi to prove it is the birthplace of Hanuman. “We will not take up the issue with Andhra Pradesh. However, we will have a survey conducted by the ASI on the lines of Varanasi court’s decision to settle the issue over Kashi Vishwanath temple.”

Meanwhile, Raghaveshwara Bharathi, head of Ramachandrapura Mutt in Shivamogaa district of Karnataka, cites the Valmiki Ramayana to claim that the actual spot is at Kudle Beach in coastal Karnataka’s Gokarna. “Based on Ramayana, we can say that Gokarna is Lord Hanuman’s janmabhoomi and Anjeyanadri in Kishkinda was his karmabhoomi. In Valmiki Ramayana, it is mentioned clearly that Lord Hanuman’s birthplace is in Gokarna.”"

The 600-bed facility is filled to capacity which means patients, many of whom have to travel considerable distances to reach the hospital, had to wait to secure admission or consult doctors.Several of those who waited suffered breathing difficulties and kept away from others. A Shiva , a patient who had travelled from Bhatambra village in Bhalki taluk, said he waited for a bed for four days before he secured one. He said he had given his sample for Covid-19 tests but did not get a report. When he enquired with the hospital, he was told he was infected. He was then immediately given a bed.Ramachandran R, deputy commissioner, Bidar district, who visited the hospital on Wednesday, insisted that there is no scarcity of beds. He, however, added that people with minor symptoms should not panic and throng hospitals.âOnly those who suffer severe symptoms or are critically ill will be admitted,â he said. âOthers should isolate themselves at home and take medication for fever and body pain. Doctors must focus on saving lives.â He said doses of Remdesivir are being given to those who need it."

Some are turning to God while are others are finding solace in their dogsIt’s been a year and a few days since the first case of Covid-19 was detected in Bengaluru. In the Second Wave,andare dealing with a virus that’s constantly changing its stripes, more infections, lack of oxygen, beds, ambulances, drugs, plasma, testing kits… And, no one seems to have addressed the issue of how the medical fraternity is managing emotional stress from dealing with a pandemic that continues to devastate us.And still, whentalks to me on the phone, it feels like he is sitting on an ocean deck sipping. All the doctors in the frontlines have a Buddha-like calm but when they speak of their stressors, you wonder how they do it.“Earlier, I was only giving directions about treatment protocol to be followed but since the pandemic, I’ve had to take care of running the hospital, responding to depleting supplies of oxygen and medicines, managing nurses and doctors, dealing with government rules, being available to go to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike office whenever I get summoned or else have the Disaster Management Act invoked against me... What choice do I have? I can’t run away. Some of my friends have shut their hospitals and say they will re-open in two years when the pandemic is over.”Dr Hiremath says doctors are trained in crisis management but his coping mechanism is a two-hour pooja in the morning.“I wake up at 4 am and do the rudra abhisheka every day for two hours, from 5 am. I don’t leave the house till I finish it. My son is angry that his life has been cruelly interrupted because he is in his 12 std. My wife, who is a radiologist, is anxious that I may contract covid. I feel I have strong immunity and I will manage.”But his advice to patients and their families is to step back and take a break. “Take a week off and connect with your family. Call your parents, grandparents, friends. For Indians, the family is our support system. Rekindle those relationships. This will release a lot of serotonin (the happy chemical) in the face of all the gloom. If one is Covid-positive, you must do this. Don’t talk, listen to your family speak.”“I’m fortunate to have the support of a wonderful clinical and administrative team who despite the tremendous pressures is still working with a smile. Be optimistic in your outlook and be assured that no pandemic lasts forever and this too shall pass and life will be back to normal sometime in the future.Always maintain a life-work balance and as far as possible make sure you stay healthy, have a good night’s sleep and have some personal time whenever possible. I also strongly believe that we do our best but the rest is in God’s hands and that has always been a source of strength for me.”A female doctor working on the frontlines of a hospital says, “After nine years in medical school, you’re more or less trained for this. But most of us have hobbies that we indulge in to take our mind off stress. I write and paint and watchcontent. You have to be able to switch off from work after a point, sleep, do something different.”While the first year seemed tough and most doctors somehow managed to get through it, they didn’t expect the second year to be so challenging. Says“Our patients have quadrupled in the last three weeks. We didn’t expect to see a surge of this magnitude. There’s been no time to ramp up facilities. We have no nurses.When we hear the politicians, the press and the public speak so disparagingly about us, that causes even more stress. We’re doing our best. I would do yoga or meditation if my phone stopped ringing for a minute but it does not. I like to spend time with my family to destress. I had isolated myself from them for much of last year. I lost my father after a long illness (non-Covid) and I had to deal with that too. Nobody realises that doctors have families and lives. People don’t like to meet doctors because they’re scared. So we’re socially isolated too.

236,HC says COVID-19 situation in Karnataka is ‘very bad’,"Evolve mechanism to purchase Remdesivir, says court

Describing the COVID-19 situation in the State as “very bad”, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to immediately take a call on purchasing Remdesivir directly from manufacturers and distributors, and then supply to the hospitals for a fixed price in a fair and transparent manner.

Till the government decides on direct purchasing of Remdesivir, a mechanism should be evolved immediately to give a real-time online information system on availability of Remdisivir with stockists and retails so that the family members of COVID-19 patients could procure it easily as and when the vial is prescribed by the hospitals.

Also, the court directed the government to create a distribution system for supply of oxygen to the hospitals by coordinating with manufacturers and suppliers in addition to the war room created to monitor supply of oxygen and posting of officers in oxygen refilling centres.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar, issued the directions during the hearing of PIL petitions on the issues that cropped up due to the pandemic since last year.

The Bench took into consideration a letter to the Chief Justice by S. Shivakumar, president of the Karnataka State Association of the Management of Nursing and Allied Health Sciences’ Institutions, stating that he himself has tested positive for COVID-19 and has experienced black marketing of Remdesivir and the shortage of oxygen supply and beds for COVID-19 patients.

The Bench directed the government to submit report of the technical advisory committee in a sealed cover after some of the petitioner have alleged that situation has become worse as government ignored the suggestion of the committee.

Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to take measures to ensure separate queues, as far as possible, for pregnant women and senior citizens in laboratories providing RT-PCR test facility, and take action against those labs that fail to provide results within 24 hours.

Also, the Bench asked the government to consider evolving policy on whether pregnant women require a compulsory RT-PCR test for admission for hospital for delivery if they do not have any symptoms of COVID-19."
237,"Despite Covid, Karnataka sees record foodgrain output","BENGALURU: Heavy rains, floods and the pandemic failed to slow down the foodgrain output in Karnataka in 2020-21. The state produced 154 lakh tonnes, an all-time record, as against 141 lakh tonnes in 2019-20. This is 30 per cent more than the stateâs average food production of 115 lakh tonnes. Cereals accounted for 132 lakh tonnes and pulses the rest. Separately, the state recorded the highest production of oilseeds (13 lakh tonnes). This is mainly because there was a shortage of labour. Oilseeds donât require a lot of labour, which made them many farmersâ preferred choice.How did Karnataka, which is prone to drought, floods and landslides, manage these numbers? âItâs because of fairly widespread rainfall that covered around 65 per cent of the state,â said state agriculture commissioner Brijesh Kumar Dikshit. He added that good rain in arid districts such as Tumakuru, Chitradurga , Chikkaballapur and Kolar also boosted food production.According to the state agriculture departmentâs data, farmers planted winter (rabi) crops on nearly 50 lakh hectares , which is nearly 30 per cent higher than normal. The total area of sowing during the kharif, rabi and summer seasons touched 116 lakh hectares, which increased the chances of a bumper harvest. âHigher sowing during the rabi season was mainly on account of robust rains in October,â said Dikshit.The agriculture sector, which accounts for 50 per cent of the rural economy, was also able to shake off the impact of Covid-19 because of ample subsidised inputs such as fertilisers under the Atma Nirbhar package. âDuring the peak pandemic months last year, the farm sector was the only bright spot in the state economy. The pandemic didnât affect agricultural activities,â he said.A senior professor at the agriculture university in Bengaluru said that the farm sector turned out to be more resilient than the urban economy, mainly because of sufficient rain and reverse migration. âPeople returned to agriculture after losing their jobs in cities. Ample stocks helped keep a lid on food prices,â he added."
238,Students study in market yard after hostel shunts them out,"Hostel warden cites COVID-19 guidelines

As many as 24 engineering students of the Government Engineering College at Mosale Hosahalli in Hassan taluk are preparing for the first semester examination at an empty market yard in Mosale Hosahalli.

The Backward Classes Welfare Department’s hostel has sent them out citing COVID-19 guidelines, leaving the students with no shelter and food. The guidelines suggested that all schools, colleges, hostels, and coaching classes be closed.

Chandan, a student, told The Hindu that the hostel warden asked them to vacate the rooms on Thursday morning. “We packed our things and moved to the market, close to our college. We are preparing for the exams from here,” he said. The students had to depend on hotels for food. They are yet to appear for three more papers to complete the first semester. The Visvesvaraya Technological University has not postponed exams.

T. Rangaswamy, principal of the college, said he had made temporary arrangements for the students. “The government should have allowed those appearing for exams to stay in the hostels. Right now, I have arranged a room in the college for them,” he said."

254,Three dead in separate incidents in Mulavukad,"Body of man washed ashore, woman jumps off Goshree bridge, man found hanging

Three persons, including a young woman, died in three separate incidents within the Mulavukad police station limits on Thursday.

In one incident, a man was found hanging from the second Goshree bridge, while the body of an unidentified man, seemingly in his 40s, was swept along the shore near DP World at Vallarpadam. In another incident, a woman died after reportedly jumping into the water from the same bridge.

The man found hanging was identified as Vijayan, 62, of Ward 11 in Mulavukad. He had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on Wednesday evening.

It is not clear whether the victim was aware of the result or not.

Even as the police and fire force were lowering the body around 10.30 a.m. a woman jumped off the same bridge. She was later identified as Briyona Mariyo, 26, of Pallippuram. The reason for her action was not immediately known."
254,Withdraw new vaccination policy: KSSP,"The Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad (KSSP) has urged the Centre to withdraw its new vaccination policy which it said would adversely affect the public.

It also asked the Centre to urgently implement a free universal vaccination programme using public funds. “The Kerala government’s stance on the issue is worth emulating, and the Centre should do that,” it said.

As per the new policy, vaccine manufacturers are obliged to give just 50% of the vaccine at restricted prices to the Centre, while they are at liberty to sell the remaining 50% to States and in the open market at a price of its choice. The Centre has not given any funds to States for this purpose, either. This will force States and private hospitals to compete in the market to procure vaccines. It will also result in sale of vaccines in black market. The net result will be that a large section of the population that is incapable of buying vaccines will be left to fend for themselves, the KSSP said, adding that such a development would blunt the fight against the pandemic.

It asked the Centre to provide necessary support to vaccine manufacturers in the public sector in order to ramp up production of vaccines domestically."
255,Fresh doses to boost vaccination drive,"2.5 lakh doses allotted to four districts, administration in 108 centres in capital, no spot registration

The district can heave a sigh of relief with the arrival of an additional batch of COVID-19 vaccine doses late Thursday.

A consignment of 2.5 lakh doses has been allocated for the Thiruvananthapuram region comprising Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Alappuzha districts. While the district is likely to get 30,000 doses initially, official sources said up to 65,000 doses could be expected.

Following a lull caused by an acute shortage of vaccine doses, the vaccination programme is set to be on track with the health authorities scheduling the drive across 108 centres in the district on Friday. Barring three hospitals that will provide Covaxin, all the others will administer Covishield. These include 47 public institutions and 58 private hospitals.

600 doses a day

Notably, the Jimmy George indoor stadium, which has functioned as a mega vaccination centre, will rejoin the drive three days after the programme was suspended there owing to the paucity of vaccine. However, spot registration will no longer be entertained there with the government insisting on online bookings. Moreover, the vaccination drive at the stadium could be restricted to around 600 doses a day to prevent crowding.

The venue has earlier seen around 1,800 people getting inoculated in a day.

On Thursday, General Hospital (GH) witnessed some disorder when a large number of people queued up hoping to get registered on the spot for the vaccine. Despite having waited outside the hospital’s COVID-19 vaccination centre from 5.30 a.m., they were informed of the decision to restrict vaccines to online registrees only by 8.30 a.m This led to tension with many senior citizens venting their ire on healthcare workers. Soon, the police streamlined the crowd by sending off those who had not booked online.

A total of 2,931 vaccine doses were administered in the district on the day. Among those who received the vaccine, 1,704 were vaccinated with Covishield and 1,227 with Covaxin. Those who got the second doses include 712 front-line workers and 634 others who are aged above 45 years."
255,ISRO on guard as virus rages,"Physical attendance of staff limited, visitors banned on premises

The second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kerala has prompted units of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the State capital to ramp up safety measures.

In line with the Central government guidelines, physical attendance at the office has been limited to staff of the rank of deputy secretary and above. Meetings were fully shifted to virtual mode from Monday.

Thiruvananthapuram is home to three major units of the space agency — Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) at Thumba, Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) at Valiyamala, and the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) at Vattiyurkavu. The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) is also situated in the district.

“Several measures were put in place last year following the outbreak. Biometric fingerprint scanning and entrance turnstiles have been replaced with no-touch RFID readers. Visitors are banned on the premises. Given the recent increase in cases, we have instructed staff who have fever or cold not to report for duty. Sanitiser dispensers have been deployed all over the campus,” a VSSC official said. The VSSC has around 4,700 staff plus contract employees, trainees, and security personnel.

Similar measures are in place at the LPSC, which has around 1,000 staff and the IISU, which has 300 employees.

Impact on schedule

How the second wave would affect the ISRO launch calendar remains to be seen, officials here said. The pandemic had forced the space agency to put off several missions last year. In 2020, the ISRO facilities in Thiruvananthapuram had remained shut for nearly two months on account of the pandemic. Work had resumed on a limited scale only in late May.

ISRO has a GSLV Mk II mission (GISAT-1 payload) tentatively scheduled for May, but the launch date has not been finalised yet. The space agency also has at least two PSLV missions tentatively lined up in 2021."
256,Development should have ‘Earth First’ vision: scholar,"Virtual meet marks observance of Earth Day

T.V. Sajeev, Senior Principal Scientist, Kerala Forest Research Institute, has said that all developmental projects should have the “Earth First” vision.

Handling a session on “Climate Change and Development of Kerala”, through Google meet on Thursday, Dr. Sajeev said that concerns related to the earth the global level were numerous.

Close to 75% of terrestrial environment and 66% of the marine environments were “severely altered” owing to anthropogenic activities. Hence, the world needed to look at the environmental viability of projects rather than just the economic viability, Dr. Sajeev said.

The programme was organised by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad district unit to mark Earth Day which fell on April 22."
256,Vizhinjam port: arbitration proceedings begin,"AVPPL misses Phase I deadline

The arbitration proceedings between the State government and Adani Vizhinjam Port Pvt. Ltd. (AVPPL), tasked with constructing the Vizhinjam International Multipurpose Seaport, on a 16-point ‘notice of disputes’ raised by the AVPPL has commenced.

The AVPPL will file their claims by April 26 before a tribunal comprising presiding officer R.V. Ravindran and arbitrators K.S.P. Radhakrishnan and Kurian Joseph, all former Supreme Court judges. A preliminary online hearing was held after Mr. Radhakrishnan, arbitrator appointed by the AVPPL, and Mr. Joseph, arbitrator for the State government, opted for Mr. Ravindran as the presiding officer.

State’s counterclaims

The State will get two months to file counterclaims after the AVPPL files its claims and the arbitration is expected to be completed by December 2021. Official sources said most of the 16 claims are ‘force majeure’ and had been rejected by the Vizhinjam International Seaport Limited (VISL), the executing agency of the seaport project.

The AVPPL had missed the project’s Phase I deadline of December 3, 2019. It had sought 16 months’ extension citing ‘damage’ inflicted by Cyclone Ockhi. The claim was rejected as just a dredger was damaged.

Extension

However, the VISL granted extension following the lockdown imposed last year due to COVID-19. The project is still dragging on. As per the agreement, after the Phase 1 deadline, there is a nine-month cure period (grace period), in which after the first three months, i.e. after March 2020, the AVPPL has to pay damages for not meeting the deadline.

In July 2020, the AVPPL raised the disputes, bypassing the conciliation norms cited in the agreement. The AVPPL also approached the International Centre for Alternate Dispute Resolution (ICADR) to seek an arbitrator’s appointment on behalf of the government under ICADR Arbitration Rules, 1996.

As per the legal opinion received by the government, the AVPPL move was ‘premature and irregular.’"

258,50 inmates infected in district jail,"Nearly 50 residents of the district jail at Kakkanad have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, forcing the prison authorities to adopt precautionary measures.

In an initial antigen test, 16 were found to be infected following which RT-PCR tests were held for the residents which revealed the extent of infection.

The infected have been isolated, sources said. They are being examined regularly by an in-house doctor.

Plans are on to conduct another round of RT-PCR tests for the rest early next week. Thankfully, only two of the staff members who incidentally chose not to vaccinate have been infected. All the rest have received at least one dose of vaccination, which the prison sources felt is turning out to be a formidable defence against the pandemic.

The prison, with a capacity for 132, now houses around 185 with no move yet to reduce the occupancy."

264,Long queues outside civic-run vaccination centres in Mumbai,"Around 10 days before the Covid-19 vaccination opens up for all above the age of 18 years, long queues were witnessed outside government and civic-run vaccination centres. The burden on government vaccination centres has increased as there are frequent closures of vaccination centres and many private hospitals have discontinued vaccination owing to shortage of stock.On Thursday, 48 private vaccination centres were shut owing to shortage of vaccine doses. As a result, long queues were seen outside civic-run vaccination centres. The scene was the same on Wednesday when around 40 of the total 129 vaccination centres could not carry out vaccination. Several jumbo centres like Dahisar Jumbo Centre, NESCO and civic hospitals in the city are witnessing long queues for vaccination.The daily number of people being vaccinated has come down to 25,000 to 40,000 from 50,000 to 60,000 about two weeks ago.Ashish Mhatre, a Dahisar resident said, “I had gone to Dahisar Jumbo Centre for vaccination, but there was a long queue and no social distancing was followed. I will now register and go at a later stage after taking a prior appointment.”The BMC on the other hand aims to have 500 vaccination centres in the city in the coming months, as vaccination for everyone above 18 years of age starts from May 1, 2021. As of Wednesday morning, the BMC had around 180,000 vaccines in stock that may go down to around 100,000 by Friday morning. On Thursday, 48,152 citizens were vaccinated of which 21,762 were senior citizens above the age of 60, 22,104 were between the age group of 45 to 60, 1,491 were health care workers and 2,795 were front line workers. Overall, 2,128,095 of citizens have been vaccinated in the city, so far. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have been getting vaccine doses from the Centre, but they are not in bulk.” The BMC has a storage capacity of stocking around 12 million vaccine doses at the central vaccine storage facility in Kanjurmarg, and the same is expected to be utilised starting May 1. Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, “The crowding in the form of long queues outside civic vaccination centres will only prove dangerous considering the virus is mutating and its new variants are spreading faster. In all this, the long queues outside vaccination centres only add to the spread.”"
264,Maharashtra expects hiccups in its 18+ vaccination drive,"With eight days to go for universal Covid-19 vaccination to start in the state, Maharashtra could witness hiccups in the inoculation drive from May 1 due to inadequate supply of vaccine shots. Three days after the Centre announced the decision to start vaccination for all adults in the country from May 1, the state government said it will start negotiations with foreign vaccine manufacturers as the two Indian companies have either not released prices or have their production booked by the Centre for a month. Meanwhile, the state government is also deliberating on the proposal to make the vaccine doses available for free for the poor in the 18 to 44 age group. The Centre on Monday announced vaccination for all adults in the country from May 1, but the states and Union territories have to procure the doses from manufacturers. The manufacturers would supply 50% of the ordered doses to the Government of India and 50% to the state governments and the open market. Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said a plan is being chalked out to procure vaccines. “A plan is being worked out… since foreign import is now allowed and there is Bharat Biotech, we will get in touch with them. The vaccination drive for [age] 18 to 44 will start on May 1, but the stock is expected to be limited. In that age group, there are roughly 55 or 57.5 million people. So, we will require about 120 million doses, including the wastage, over a span of four to five months, depending on how soon we get the stock,” said Kunte.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held an online meeting with Serum Institute of India’s Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday, where he was told that the company’s production has been booked till May 24. In light of that, the state will start negotiations with manufacturers of imported vaccines as it will not be able to purchase stock from Serum Institute of India, which makes Covidshield, till third week of May, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, as it has not released its prices.“Adar Poonawalla [during a meeting] told the chief minister that their entire production has been booked by the Centre till May 24. It is April 22 today, so, it is clear that for an entire month we will not be able to purchase [vaccine] for the 18-45 age group. Senior officials are in touch with Bharat Biotech, but so far, they have not released the price for state governments. If that happens in a day or two, we will be able to place order with them,” Tope said.However, the Centre refuted the claim and said that Serum Institute has not contracted all its production of vaccines to the Centre till May 25. A statement from the PIB said, “State governments are free to procure Covid-19 vaccine doses from the vaccine manufacturers as per the Liberalised Pricing and accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy.” It further added, “A key feature of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy is that the “Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to Govt. of India and would be free to supply remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the other than Govt. of India channel”. The state governments are free to purchase doses from the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, it is very clear that every month out of the total CDL cleared doses available with any vaccine manufacturer, 50% doses would be available for other than Government of India channels.”Earlier in the week, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had said that the state would use certain development funds, but not hamper the procuring of imported vaccines, if need be. Tope added that the state would negotiate with the companies including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Sputnik V to buy the “extremely expensive” imported vaccines. “Sputnik V, Moderna, American and the Chinese vaccines are extremely expensive compared to our vaccines. These vaccines are about seven to 10 times costlier than then Indian ones. But we can carry out a negotiation at the highest level with them. Chief minister and deputy chief minister have already made it clear that our government will consider [purchasing] it, if they reduce the prices since we are going to purchase in a huge volume,” he added. Kunte added that the state will also hold talks with Bharat Biotech soon. “There will be a wide range of choice,” he said.The health minister also said that the state government would consider providing free vaccines to “poor and extremely poor” section of the society in the age group of 18 to 44 years. He said such a proposal will be mooted by the health department and the State Cabinet will take a call on it soon. He however ruled out free vaccines for others who can afford the jab.“We will be taking up the matter of providing vaccines for free in the upcoming cabinet meeting. The government will definitely think of the poor and extremely poor sections of society. But who can afford the vaccines in the 18 to 44 age bracket must pay for the vaccine shot. The health department will put up a proposal to give vaccines for free to the poor, but the final decision will be taken by the Cabinet,” he said. Currently, the vaccination is free for all in those who are 45 and above. For those who want to pay for the vaccine, have an option to get vaccinated from selected private hospitals. "
265,"Maharashtra scouts for vaccine stock, next phase to start slow","Health minister Rajesh Tope

Mumbai: Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla has told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that his production lines are booked to meet the advance orders of the Centre till May 24. âThis means we will not be able to purchase from him till then,â said state public health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday in a sign that the vaccine drive for the 18-45 age group that starts from May 1 may have a slow start in Maharashtra.

Thackeray had a brief meeting with Poonawalla on Wednesday on the supply of Covishield to Maharashtra following the Centreâs decision to open up direct sales by vaccine manufacturers to states and private hospitals.

Tope said the state has also begun talks with Bharat Biotech for Covaxin supplies. The state is reaching out to manufacturers to purchase stocks ahead of the vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group which will start from May 1.

âCM and senior officials have reached out to Biotech Pharma and since they have not announced their rates for state governments, we are waiting for those. Once the rates are out we will be able to purchase from them,"" said Tope.

He also indicated the state may consider giving the vaccine free to poorer sections. ""People who can afford the vaccines, should pay for it. We will consider helping the poor who cannot afford it. The final decision on the cost and which section of society will get concessions will be decided by the cabinet,"" said Tope.

Tope said he has brought to Thackerayâs notice the manner in which Assam government used the Assam Arogya Nidhi to buy 1 crore vaccines from Bharat Biotech. Maharashtra is yet to place orders.

266,Control Covid-19 situation at ground level: HC,"MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday told the Maharashtra government to take control of the Covid-19 situation on the ground due to âconfusion and panicâ among people with regard to shortage of Remdesivir injection , beds, oxygen and delay in getting tests results.âAt the ground level, people are facing difficulties,ââ said a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and Girish Kulkarni hearing a PIL by advocate Sneha Marjadi on the plight of patients and their relatives and her personal experience.Advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the supply situation is in control for a few days after receiving 2.69 lakh vials of Remdesivir.He said there is a public misconception that Remdesivir is a magical drug for cure of Covid-19.``It reduces the requirement of oxygen. People are insisting `give me Remdesivirâ,â he said, blaming the âmiddle-class and higher classââ for the shortage saying they bought vials in excess.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh said âthe mindset is it (Ramdesivir) has to be given to all patients.âThe judges said there appears to be confusion among public and medical personnel.âToday it is a situation of panic,"" said Justice Kulkarni.The judges said proper advisories must be issued in the print and electronic media due to contrary messages circulating on social media platforms.The CJ then said, âToday when I was coming to court, I found people loitering with masks below their nose.""He referred to a last year's report that said people have to be careful till June 30.``Had we not lowered our guard, we would not have seen this day,ââ he added.The AG said 1,200 metric tonnes oxygen is daily manufactured and the rest is imported from other states to meet daily demand of 1,500 MT while will soon go up to 2,000 MT.He denied shortage of beds saying in public and BMC hospitals they are available.âThe middle class and higher class want beds in private hospitals of their choice. This is mainly projected by the media as a shortage of beds.âSenior advocate Anil Sakhare, appearing for BMC, said the civic body has systems in place to supply oxygen to all hospitals in the city.

266,Fresh Covid-19 restrictions come into force,"MUMBAI: Fresh restrictions on travel, attendance in offices and wedding functions announced by the Maharashtra government to check the Covid-19 spread came into force on Thursday night.Maharashtra, facing an unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases, is already under severe restrictions since April 14 and the fresh ""lockdown-like"" curbs were announced on Wednesday to break the chain of viral transmission in the state.Prohibitory orders, banning assembly of five or more people at once place, are in force till 7am on May 1, while non-essential activities are not being allowed.Essential services, including grocery stores, are permitted to operate only between between 7 and 11am.The new restrictions under the government's 'Break- the-Chain' programme came into force at 8pm on Thursday and will remain effective till 7am on May 1.In the cabinet meeting this week, several ministers demanded a total lockdown for 15 days to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, the state worst hit by the pandemic in the country.But chief minister Uddhav Thackeray decided against imposing a total shutdown, apparently after prime minister Narendra Modi's address to the nation where he said a lockdown should be the ""last resort"".Now, with the new curbs the government has decided to reduce presence of people on the streets and in public transport.According to an order issued by Chief Secretary Sitaram Kunte, government offices - central, state and local authorities - will work with 15 per cent attendance except those in emergency services directly connected to management of the pandemic.Other offices, allowed to operate as per the existing rules, will function with 15 per cent strength or five people, whichever is more, stated the order.Only government personnel and those in emergency services would be allowed to use suburban trains, metro and mono services in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it said.All those engaged in medical services - doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians and clinical staff - will be issued travel passes on basis of identity cards.However, patients needing medical treatment and specially-abled persons can travel in trains, the order said.Municipal and state transport buses will operate at 50 per cent capacity with no standing passengers.Marriage ceremonies have to be conducted as a single event in a single hall not extending beyond two hours with maximum of 25 person in attendance, the order said, adding violation will attract a fine of Rs 50,000.For inter-city and inter-district travel bylong- distance trains and buses, the local railways/state transport authorities will ensure screening of passengers, the order said.Passengers of private buses (who are allowed to travel) will have to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days after they reach their destination. Bus operators will have to stamp the passengers' hands to indicate they are supposed to stay at home for 14 days.On Thursday, police vans made rounds of the main streets in Mumbai asking people on the loudspeaker to stay home and avoid crowding.Police have put up barricades at the entry and exit gates of suburban railway stations to prevent unauthorised people from travelling in local trains.Police personnel manned the streets to check motorists and cars for the yellow, green and red stickers which are to be used for specific purpose while moving around during the period of restrictions.On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 67,013 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 40,94,840, while 568 more patients succumbed to the infection, said a health department official."
267,Additional forces deployed in Mumbai police stations to help enforce curbs,"Tasked with ensuring that Covid-related restrictions were followed, the Mumbai Police force received a booster on Wednesday after a thousand personnel from its local arms division were dispatched to its 90-odd police stations to enforce the new curbs that get effective from Thursday night.

In addition, Director General of Police Sanjay Pande said, three companies of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) have also been given to Mumbai Police. The force will be used as and when required by the local police, he added.

Confirming the development, Chaitanya S, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), operations, and Public Relations Officer for Mumbai Police, said, “We have stepped up our enforcement against violators and instructions have been given to all police stations to crack down on them.”

Elaborating on composition of the SRPF, a senior Mumbai police official said, “We have a total of 12 companies of SRPF in usual course. For Covid, we got three extra SRPF companies. Each company has three platoons, each of which has 30 personnel.”

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Government Railway Police (GRP) said that even though the crowds in local trains have dried up, the number of people looking to board outstation trains was swelling at the junctions under Central and Western Railways. Like last year, several thousands of migrants are trying to return to their hometowns due to the ongoing lockdown.

Quaiser Khalid, Railway police commissioner, said, “We are not allowing any passenger to enter the railway premises till they have a reserved train ticket for long distance train. I have asked my men to maintain a distance of six feet while checking their tickets. We have kept only one entry and exit point for passengers at the junctions and social distancing is being maintained.”"

267,Mumbai: Param Bir now faces inquiry for corruption on allegations made by cop,"Former police commissioner Param Bir Singh

Mumbai: The home department has ordered an inquiry against former police commissioner Param Bir Singh in connection with the allegations of corruption levelled against him by an inspector, said sources on Thursday. DGP Sanjay Pandey has been asked to investigate the allegations against Singh, said the sources.

The allegations were levelled by police inspector Anup Dange , who was suspended from the force last year and reinstated recently.

Dange claims Singh had demanded Rs 2 crore from him to revoke his suspension. The inspector had written a letter to the additional chief secretary (home) about Singhâs demand.

Singh had denied the allegations. DGP Pandey was not available for comment.

The inquiry would be the second one ordered by the state government against Singh.

The home department had previously asked the DGP to conduct an inquiry against Singh for alleged dereliction of duty in connection with the investigation into the recovery of a vehicle with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambaniâs residence, Antilia in south Mumbai, on February 25. Singh had been transferred from the post of police chief on March 17 after criticism of his handling of the Ambani case.

On March 20, Singh wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that the home minister at the time, Anil Deshmukh, had resorted to malpractices and asked police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and hotels.

Deshmukh resigned from the state cabinet after the Bombay high court ordered a CBI inquiry into the allegations made by Singh. PTI

268,Covid second wave: PMC decides not to spend on new civic works,"The PMC's plans to take up new infrastructure projects in the city were badly impacted last year after the outbreak of Covid-19 and the municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar had put restrictions on taking up new development work. (Express Photo by Pavan Khengre)

The infrastructure work in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken a hit as the surge of Covid-19 cases continues to grip the city in the second wave.

Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar has directed his officials that no spending would be allowed for new civic works for the moment owing to the pandemic’s impact.

The plans of the PMC to take up new infrastructure projects in the city were disrupted last year after the pandemic began. Kumar had put restrictions on initiation of new development work.

The state had also directed all civic bodies not to take up any new infrastructure projects due to reduced revenue collection and increased spending to establish health facilities to contain the pathogen’s spread.

The civic administration had constituted a finance committee to decide on each proposal of civic works in the city. Following the go ahead of the committee, process for the new works was initiated. However, the municipal commissioner had discontinued the finance committee at the end of the financial year. The same was reconstituted after the city started witnessing a surge of Covid-19 cases.

“The municipal commissioner has directed all the civic departments not to take up any new development work but allowed spending of 50 percent of the budgetary allocation for the ongoing projects,” said a civic officer.

Each proposal of the infrastructure projects would have to get the finance committee’s nod, he said, adding that the head of various civic departments have been warned of action if the order is violated.

The civic administration has been asked to spend money only on maintenance and repair of the existing civic infrastructure in the city, the officer added.

The finance committee reviews the financial situation of the city body based on the revenue collection and decides strategy on its spending for very important civic work.

At present, the PMC is engaged in scaling up health infrastructure in the city to deal with the pandemic. It has recently decided to spend Rs 350 crore for Covid-related work in the city.

The PMC has a budget estimate of Rs 8,370 crore for 2021-22, including Rs 4,035 crore as capital expenditure for civic infrastructure projects."
268,Pvt bus operators to stop service after state’s Q order,"Nagpur: Peeved by the order by the state government to âbreak the chainâ, most private bus operators in the state have decided to stop services from Friday.

On April 21, the state issued an order that private buses can ply between inter-district and inter-city only for emergency or essential services or valid reasons with 50% capacity. Essential services have been defined as medical emergencies or people attending funerals. Violations would invite a fine of Rs 10,000.

Secondly, the buses will have only two stoppages in cities and operator will have to put a stamp on the hand of alighting passengers for 14 daysâ quarantine. Besides, local disaster management authority (DMA) may decide on a rapid antigen test (RAT) with the help of private labs and cost will have to be borne by the passenger.

âThe order is ambiguous. How will you verify the emergency? Though it directly ban operation of buses, the order amounts to that. When there will be no passengers, why operate the buses and sustain losses? The operators are yet to come out of the shock of the first lockdown,â said Prasanna Patwardhan, president, Maharashtra Rajya Truck, Tempo, Tanker, Bus Vahatuk Mahasangh.

âThe association has left the decision about running buses to the individual operator as the order doesnât stop it completely,â Patwardhan added.

Mahendra Luley, president, Bus & Car Operators Confederation of India (BOCI), Maharashtra, said, âThe order is such that you cannot choose between the two. There are at least 250 private buses operating to various destinations from Nagpur. Buses to MP and Chhattisgarh have already stopped last month. Some operations in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh were on but those too will be shut now.â

Even the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) officials are confused about following the stamping condition. Like specific direction to private operators to stamp passengers, the order is not clear whether a similar procedure has to be followed by the MSRTC.

âWe have been told the job of stamping for 14-day quarantine will be done by the health and revenue department staff at check-posts and bus stops. They will also do thermal scanning and RAT, if needed. Those found positive will be sent to nearest quarantine centres for 14 days,â said divisional controller Nilesh Belsare.

âThe stateâs idea is to prevent unnecessary travel by people. With home quarantine threat, we donât expect many people travelling. We are also going to cross-check whether the passengers are travelling for a genuine reason,â said Belsare.

Meanwhile, NMC has started screening railway passengers arriving from Goa, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Kerala, Uttarakhand, and Delhi. âOn Wednesday, RAT was done on four passengers but they tested negative. On Thursday, two passengers tested negative. At least 1,400 passengers arrive via 17 trains from these six states that are being screened,â said railway officials.

269,"Mumbai: 17-year-old boy, three others held for gangrape of minor","The three accused, aged between 20 and 22 years, are the woman's neighbours in a slum.

The Bandra police recently arrested three men and detained a juvenile for the alleged gangrape of a minor girl between 2019 and 2020.

The rape survivor, now aged 18, got an FIR lodged on April 13 after a video of her being sexually assaulted by the juvenile, then 17 years old, went viral on social media. She has alleged that the accused were blackmailing her with the video and finally circulated it when she stopped giving in to their demands.

The three accused, aged between 20 and 22 years, are the woman’s neighbours in a slum. The complainant, who was aged 17 when she was allegedly raped, had recently got married.

The woman was raped for the first time in 2019 by the 17-year-old boy. Another accused had shot a video of the incident. Following this, the four accused kept blackmailing her with the video and gangraped her several times.

“When the complainant stopped giving into their demands, they circulated the one-minute video on a WhatsApp group. One of her relatives saw it and informed her parents. Confronted by her parents, she decided to approach the police,” said an officer. The FIR was registered on April 13 under the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Information Technology Act.

The same day, two accused were arrested and the minor was produced before a juvenile court and sent to an observation home.

The last arrest was made on April 18."

271,"Cases, recoveries and deaths in Vidarbha constant for last 5 days","Nagpur: On Thursday, Vidarbha reported 15,597 new cases, 13,352 recoveries and 265 deaths. While cases and recoveries increased as compared to Wednesday, there were fewer deaths.In the last five days, the average daily cases, recoveries and deaths have been almost constant, which is an indicator that the curve of Vidarbhaâs Covid-19 cases is moving towards plateau.The number of tests in the 11 districts of Vidarbha has been more or less around 60,000 per day for the last three days. Number of new cases is still under 16,000 while the number of recoveries is increasing slowly but steadily for the last six days.Increasing recoveries and constant number of new cases can be an indicator of the wave reaching its peak. Now the graph can be expected to gradually move towards a plateau.Deaths, however, are still a major concern. Of the total deaths reported on Thursday, 110 were from Nagpur district alone. These include 58 from Nagpur city and 45 from Nagpur rural, which means cases are incresing in the rural parts.Nine out of 11 districts reported more than 10 deaths on Thursday, with Yavatmal registering 37 deaths, which is highest after Nagpur. Yavatmal is the only district after Nagpur to report more than 1,000 deaths due to Covid-19. This is when the population of entire Yavatmal district is less than the Nagpur city alone.Chandrapur reported 28 deaths, Gadchiroli 19, Wardha 16, and Gondia 11. With this, cumulative toll of Nagpur division has nearly doubled than that of Amravati division.The number of under-treatment patients is still high. On Thursday, 1,42,407 patients were under-treatment in Vidarbha. TOI has reported earlier that at this pace, the number may increase up to 2 lakh by May 1. Increased number of under-treatment patients is adding into the crisis of beds, oxygen and medicines in Vidarbha.Chandrapur: Yet another sharp rise of 1537 cases was recorded, while 28 patients succumbed on Thursday.

271,Five districts in Maharashtra report highest Covid CFR,"As Maharashtra recorded 67,013 new cases on Thursday, taking the total cases to over 4 million, five districts have emerged as areas of concern with respect to the case fatality ratio (CFR; the percentage of deaths per 100 cases) and in at least three of the districts where data is available, test positivity rate (TPR; number of positive cases per 100 tests) as well.In the period from April 15 to April 21, as Maharashtra recorded its highest seven-day average in both cases as well as fatalities, the CFR of five districts posed the most concern. Of them, Ahmednagar recorded the highest at 1.4%, followed by Nagpur (0.95%), Mumbai (0.64%), Nashik (0.62%) and Pune (0.33%). The TPR, however, was the highest in Nagpur with 34%, while Pune district recorded 26.64% and Mumbai posted 17.21% in the same period. Nashik and Ahmednagar did not reveal their tests, and therefore the TPR could not be calculated. State-wide, the average daily cases touched 64,238, while daily deaths averaged 443 -- highest ever in the pandemic in the country – in the same time period. The state’s TPR averaged 24.81%. The CFR was 0.69% in the same period.To be sure, the CFR in Maharashtra has been consistently falling since January 31. On that day, the overall CFR stood at 2.52%. This fell to 1.54% on April 21. The main reason for this was that deaths have not increased in the same proportion as cases. On January 31, Maharashtra recorded 2630 cases and 42 deaths. On April 21, it recorded 67,468 cases and 568 deaths, its highest one-day death toll.Ahmednagar faces a huge shortage of oxygen cylinders, and all the hospitals are full. The local authorities on Tuesday sought oxygen from Chakan in Pune. When the tanker reached the border, it was stopped by the Pune based authorities and made to halt for two hours. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had to intervene to offer reprieve to the patients.The Maharashtra Government announced a total lockdown which will come to force on Thursday night to contain the virus.The high number of cases in these places has resulted in the burdening of the medical infrastructure which means the shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has requested for supply of medical grade oxygen for the hospitals, following which the Centre has made a road map on supplying oxygen to the state.The Centre has earmarked 1661 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to reach the state from various states, but it is as yet unclear when the oxygen is scheduled to reach.“We have taken various steps to ease the solution and would like the central government to cooperate with us to get out of this crisis. The Centre needs to increase its quota of oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir for Maharashtra,” Tope said.In Pune, the total deaths due to Covid-19 have now reached to 8890 ever since the outbreak of the virus. Many of the small hospitals have stopped admitting patients due to the lack of oxygen. On Wednesday, the district recorded the largest number of cases and there are now 121,284 active cases.In Nagpur, a shortage of Remdesivir, an anti-viral injection, and medical grade oxygen prompted the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court (HC) to take suo moto cognizance of the shortages. On Wednesday night, at a late hearing, it pulled up the Centre for lessening the supply of oxygen from a Bhilai-based supplier, from 110MT to 60MT in a communication dated April 18.At a time when the supply of oxygen should have been increased it was reduced instead, the HC noted and ordered that the supply be restored. The region, it noted, was facing a shortfall of at least 100MT.Earlier in the week, it had asked the Central Controller of Drugs in India to ensure that 10,000 vials of Remdesivir be given to Nagpur. Two days later, the Court rapped the Maharashtra Government for its failure to comply fully with its order.Nashik has become another hotspot for the virus as there are currently 46,253 active patients on Wednesday and has registered a total number of 2701 deaths. The city is facing huge shortage of oxygen and families of patient are frantically searching for Remdesivir injections. “We need at least 125 metric tonnes but are getting only 85 metric tonnes. Even that is very erratic as it sometimes gets caught in various problems,” said senior NCP Minister Chhagan Bhujbal.On Wednesday, one of the tankers supplying oxygen to patients receiving treatment for the coronavirus disease at Dr Zakir Naik Municipal Hospital malfunctioned, which led to the death of 24 persons.In Mumbai which has 84,450 active cases, the government is pulling all stops to beat the shortage. “We are making all efforts to save the lives of the people,” said Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the people in metros are getting the virus due to various reasons.“These election rallies were super spreaders and thousands of people are coming from there in flights and railways. This has played a major role in hike in numbers,” said Shaikh."
272,"Firemen plug O2 pipe leak in NMC hosp, save 42 Covid-19 patients","Nagpur: Swift response of three firemen at Nagpur Municipal Corporation-run Ayush Hospital in Sadar area averted a Nashik hospital-like tragedy on Thursday evening. The firemen plugged the leakage in the oxygen pipeline and saved 40 patients on oxygen support at the hospital.

A senior official from the NMCâs fire department said the incident took place around 4pm. NMCâs superintending engineer Manoj Talekwar said a nasal release valve had developed snag and it interrupted the supply of oxygen to a few patients. âThe oxygen supply was regulated after carrying out necessary repairs,â he said.

Following a spike in coronavirus cases in the city, the civic body had converted Ayush Hospital into a 40 oxygen bed unit and started admitting Covid-19 patients.

Hariharsinh Gaherwar, an eyewitness, told TOI he received a call from his brother Maheshsinh, who was admitted in the hospital about sudden dip in oxygen supply. Without wasting time, he rushed to the hospital and witnessed a panic among patients and their relatives due to leakage in oxygen pipeline.

Gaherwar then called fireman from NMCâs fire and emergency services department Jagdish Bais, whose relative too was admitted at the same hospital. Bais and doctors found the pipeline with one valve leaking in the hospital backyard. Bais summoned Sudhakar Gavai, a technician from the fire department, who too reached within 10 minutes.

He stopped the cylinder supply. Bais and other relatives moved at least 15 jumbo oxygen cylinders to the Covid ward situated on the first floor of the two-storey building. âWe ensured not a single life was lost due to non-supply of oxygen,â he said adding the ward boys and nurses at the hospital helped connecting the oxygen cylinders to resume supply.

Though the fire department made temporary arrangements, the work to repair the damaged nozzle was on. Meanwhile, superintending engineer Manoj Talewar said the damaged parts will be replaced.

Patientsâ relatives wondered why no technician was there to monitor the oxygen supply when the incident took place. They also raised the question over the quality of work.

Additional municipal commissioners Ram Joshi, Sanjay Nipane, Talewar and chief fire officer Rajendra Uchake visited the hospital.

All Safe and Sound

* 4 pm Covid-patients sensed dip in oxygen supply

* Informed relatives

* NMCâs fire department called

* Doctors, nursing staff, fireman swung into action

* Firemen with technician reached and plugged the leakage

* Oxygen cylinders shifted to Covid floor and supply resumed

* All 42 patients safe

272,"In Pimpri, 205 patients gasped for breath as oxygen tanker ‘diverted’","The Auto Cluster facility every day requires at least 5 metric tonnes of oxygen. It has an oxygen tank with 10KL capacity.

Even as the Pune Zilla Parishad on Thursday denied the deaths of three COVID-19 patients attributed to shortage of oxygen at a private hopsital in Chakan, Pimpri-Chinchwad, as many as 205 COVID-19 patients were at high risk Wednesday when the oxygen tank at PCMC-run facility at Auto Cluster, Chinchwad, had almost run out of stock.

The emergency situation developed at the Auto Cluster facility Wednesday evening, where 205 COVID-19 patients were either on oxygen or ventilator support, as the tanker supplying oxygen failed to turned up. The oxygen manufacturer of the Chakan plant had apparently diverted oxygen to Buldhana on the directives of some bigwigs in the government, alleged government and civic officials.

PCMC Deputy Municipal Commissioner Smita Zagade said Thursday the situation had turned scary last evening when the COVID Auto Cluster facility ran out of oxygen. “The hospital doctors told us the oxygen stock for one hour was available and that the life of patients was in danger…” she said.

Zagade said the Divisional Commissioner, PCMC commissioner and FDA officials then made all-out efforts to get the oxygen supply from different manufacturers in Pune district and outside. “We finally managed to get the supply from the contractor who had earlier refused to provide us the oxygen…The oxygen tankers then landed up in the Auto Cluster facility by evening,” he said.

“A panic situation had ensued as the hospital gave us very little time to act… I had almost come to the point of breaking down, it was a scary situation. We wanted to save the lives of the patients under any cost and finally we succeeded in doing so,” she said.

Zagade said the private manufacturer who delivers oxygen at Auto Cluster conveyed his inability to supply the oxygen. “The manufacturer said he was taking the oxygen to Buldhana… We don’t know why he did so. He had been supplying the oxygen since the facility was set up in September. His sudden decision to stop supply was difficult to understand and was equally shocking,” she said.

Other senior PCMC officials said the manufacturer was apparently under pressure from the bigwigs in the government to divert the oxygen to Buldhana hospitals which were facing shortage.

Dr Amol Holkunde, the incharge at Auto Cluster facility, said,”The Chakan manufacturer every two days or as per the requirement provides us the oxygen tankers. On Wednesday, when the Chakan plant manufacturer conveyed inability to supply oxygen, we faced a big crisis. We had to then turn the oxygen supply to patients who did not require it or required less of it. Oxygen supply to those COVID patients who were in the process of discharge was also turned off. Likewise, we took a number of steps to save on the consumption of oxygen. As a result the oxygen supply lasted a few hours and finally we got the supply around 10.30 in the night.”

Dr Holkunde added,”If we had not used different techniques and ideas to save on the consumption of oxygen, anything could have happened. Yes, the depleting oxygen supply meant the lives of patients were in danger….But nothing untoward happened as the oxygen stock landed.

The Auto Cluster facility every day requires at least 5 metric tonne of oxygen. It has a oxygen tank whose capacity is 10 KL.

Meanwhile, Zilla Parishad CEO Ayursh Prasad denied speculations that three COVID-19 patients died a private hospital in Chakan after the hospital ran out of oxygen. “There is no truth in it…However, we have launched a medical investigation into it to find out the exact cause of death,” he said.

BDO Ajay Joshi said,”As per prima facie report, one patient died of multi-organ failure and another had arrived late….Only audit of the deaths will help us to find out the exact reason. That is being done now.”"

275,Deploy cops to impose complete lockdown: Maharashtra CM,"The Maharashtra government’s complete lockdown came into effect on Thursday evening, with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray directing the state police to impose restrictions strictly, even as the state continued to report over 60,000 cases for three days in a row. As part of the notification for strict restrictions on movement of people, generally called lockdown, people can’t step out unless they need medical attention or are working in an essential sector or want to buy essential commodities, that too for restricted timings — between 7am and 11am. While local train and metro train travel have been restricted to essential sectors and those in need of medical attention, other public transport modes such as buses have been allowed to ply, but at 50% of the seating capacity. Even those going for vaccination would be allowed to travel. The fresh restrictions will continue till 7am on May 1. The state government may extend the restrictions in case the daily cases don’t dip. The state will take a decision after reviewing the situation by the end of this month, the officials said. Thackeray held a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, home minister Dilip Walse Patil and director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pande over strict implementation of the restrictions. “The DGP was directed to deploy the police force in substantial numbers at places to deter people from stepping out of their homes unnecessarily. They were asked to avoid using force and engaging in arguments and instead book offenders using provisions of the existing laws,” said a senior official, privy to the development.State health minister Rajesh Tope said they have decided to strictly restrict people’s movement. “Breaking the chain of infection is necessary to bring down the cases, hence it has been decided to impose a lockdown. We have decided to strictly curb movement that includes restrictions on inter-district movement and internal district movement as well. People will be allowed to step out if there is a death or a medical emergency, else they won’t be allowed to travel,” Tope said. “Free movement of people will not be allowed in this period.” Attendance in government and exempted category offices has also been reduced to 15%, while those coming under essential category have been allowed to work at maximum 50% capacity.Public transport buses, including BEST in Mumbai, will be allowed to ply for all, but at 50% of the sitting capacity. Besides, taxis and autorickshaws will remain operational at 50% capacity and strictly following Covid protocols. To reduce mobility between cities and districts, travelling in public buses has been reduced to 50% of their sitting capacity. Passengers travelling inter-city/district in public transport buses will have to mandatorily go in quarantine for 14 days, with mandatory stamping on their hands, while a rapid antigen test on them at alighting point can be considered by local authorities, stated the order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte on Thursday. The decision for complete lockdown was taken in a special cabinet meeting held on Tuesday. The state health department had expressed concern over the surge in daily cases as going by their projection the tally of active cases is likely to go up to 1.1 million cases, which will overwhelm the entire health infrastructure and situation may go out of control. More than 80% health infrastructure is already occupied. As the state is struggling with shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug such as Remdesivir, ministers insisted on a complete lockdown in the cabinet meeting. “All shops related to groceries, vegetables, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries and confectionaries, including those of chicken, mutton, poultry, fish and eggs, have been allowed to operate between 7am and 11am. Home delivery from the said shops; hotels, restaurants and bars and from e-commerce websites have also been allowed till 8pm,” said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management and relief and rehabilitation department said. “We have brought restrictions only on public transport, offices, marriage functions and private vehicles,” he added. The wedding ceremony, which has proved to be a super-spreader event in the past, has been allowed in the presence of only 25 attendees. The ceremony has to be completed in two hours, while flouting of the condition may attract a fine of 50,000 to the family and action against the operator by shutting down the facility till the end of the pandemic. Flouting of rules will attract a fine of 10,000, stated the order. “The offices from the exempted category, including banks, mediclaim, insurance sector, too, will have to reduce the attendance to 15% from the existing permission of 50%. However, offices dealing in essential services, including hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, posts, ports, petrol pumps, petroleum companies, e-commerce companies etc. can operate at 50% capacity,” the order said.

275,"Maharashtra: Decide on jail transfer pleas in 48 hours, Bombay HC directs magistrates","The Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed magistrates to decide applications by prison authorities seeking transfer of undertrial prisoners from crowded jails to lesser crowded ones amid the prevailing Covid-19 situation within 48 hours. The court issued the directions to ensure ‘equitable distribution’ and to decongest jails some of which were having more prisoners than their capacity thus making the inmates susceptible to contracting the infection. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish S Kulkarni issued the directions in the suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue of overcrowding in the state and district jails which had resulted in almost 200 prisoners and 76 prison staff testing positive for Covid in the past month. In the previous hearing on April 20, the court had asked the state government to respond to its concerns over the surge in Covid-19 cases across prisons and provide suggestions on measures to prevent the same. According to the data furnished by the state to the HC about 35,124 prisoners are lodged across 47 jails in Maharashtra, which can house around 23,217 inmates only. The court on Tuesday had directed the state to provide details about the crime rate and the number of persons arrested after the April 13 ‘break the chain’ circular of the state government and inform whether there was any drop in the crime rate compared to the first 12 days of April 2021. On Thursday, after perusing the crime data submitted which it had sought from the state, the bench noted that offences of dacoity, robbery, kidnapping and theft were on the decline in 2020. However, it expressed its dissatisfaction with the data and said, “What has been placed before us does not serve the query of the court. The chart provided by the government is showing the crime rate in 2019 and 2020.” The court granted time to the state government to furnish a relevant response to its query during the next hearing. Thereafter, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the procedure for decongesting jails and transferring prisoners required a judicial order, which the concerned magistrates could decide after hearing the prisoner and prison authority, and pass a reasoned order on the transfer. After senior advocate, Mihir Desai who had represented the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), an NGO which had sought various reliefs for prisoners during the outbreak of coronavirus in jails last year informed the court that transferring prisoners to other prisons could be a good option the bench said, “We do not doubt in our mind that having regard to the critical situation prevailing now, the state government may to ensure equitable distribution of undertrial prisoners, have to decide upon shifting some of them from overcrowded correctional homes. We have expressed hope and trust that the magistrate decides application as earliest possible, preferably within 48 hours of making such application.” HC will hear the PIL next on Tuesday, April 27.

276,Mumbai: 48 private vaccine centres shut due to shortage,"At the BKC Covid vaccination centre in Mumbai. (Express Photo by Pradip Das)

At least 48 private vaccination centres in Mumbai were shut on Thursday due to a shortage of vaccines. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has about 1 lakh doses left to last it two days.

Mumbai received 1.1 lakh vaccine doses on Tuesday. With the current rate of 60,000 immunisations per day, civic officials said that the current stock might last for two more days.

Currently, the BMC is providing stock to only government centres while private centres are given more doses as the fresh supply comes in, said a civic official.

Municipal Commissioner I S Chahal on Thursday said, “F-north ward (Matunga) has 8000 doses and the rest 70,000 are distributed to all the vaccination centres.”

Since Monday, the temporary closure of private vaccination centres has led to crowding at the civic-run facilities in the city. On Thursday, citizens had to wait up to 3 hours at the BKC and Dahisar jumbo facilities. BKC jumbo facility, which has the highest vaccination turnout in the city, was shut on Monday.

Owing to shortage of vaccines, BMC had on April 9 suspended vaccination drives in 71 centres in private hospitals for three days. From April 12, the private centres had resumed immunisation.

There are 132 vaccination centres in the city — 42 at civic-run hospitals, 17 in state government-run hospitals and 73 at private hospitals. Over half of the private vaccination centres in the city suspended the vaccination drive since Monday.

To ensure that maximum college students above 18 years get vaccinated at the earliest, Cabinet Minister Aaditya Thackeray in a meeting with Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant discussed the need for a strategy to include universities and colleges across the state in the vaccination drive.

“The higher number of younger citizens getting vaccinated would help us be more confident of lesser the intensity of covid in the coming future and enable us to re-adjust and open our colleges, workplaces without the fear of severe covid cases,” Thackeray tweeted. He has also asked the BMC to start vaccination centres at 227 electoral wards in the city.

Meanwhile, BJP MLA Ameet Satam in a letter to the municipal commissioner requested vaccination of Orange ration card holders (Above Poverty Line) between 18 and 45 years of age at the civic body’s expense.

Till Thursday, BMC had vaccinated 3.13 lakh people with both doses and 18.14 lakh people with the first dose."
276,"PMC reduces staff strength attendance in govt offices, 14-day quarantine mandatory for inter-district, inter-city travellers","The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Thursday said only 15 per cent staff in establishments in exemption category, including government offices and 50 per cent in essential category, will be allowed to work till May 1, while people coming from other districts or cities will have to undergo mandatory 14-day home quarantine.

The state government on Wednesday had introduced new restrictions till May 1 to check the Covid-19 surge.

Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar said all the government offices except those in essential service category will have to work with 15 per cent strength till May 1. The same will be applicable for offices in exemption category with 15 per cent staff stength or five workers, whichever is higher.

Offices in essential category can operate with 50 per cent staff strength and can increase to 100 per cent if directly involved in essential service providers, he said.

“Inter-district or inter-city travel through private transport is restricted except for essential service providers, medical emergencies, untoward incident of death in a family or serious illness of a relative,” he said, adding that travel in private vehicles is allowed with 50 per cent seating capacity in the city or district only for valid reasons and any violation would amount to penalty of Rs 10,000.

He added, “Also, screening of passengers and Rapid Antigen Tests would be done at bus stands and those testing positive would be shifted to the nearest Covid Care Center or admitted to a hospital. Private or public transport buses running between districts would be allowed to halt only at two bus stands.”

The bus service provider will have to provide a list of passengers to the civic body to enable their tracking, he said.

The PMC has said the marriage ceremonies in the city should be held only in the presence of 25 people and be completed within two hours. “If there is a violation of the rule, then the family of the bride and groom would be fined Rs 50,000,” the civic order stated."
277,Assessing student performance a challenge in the online mode: Experts,"In early March this year, Sunita Kadam, a Class 8 teacher from a civic body school in Mumbai was busy drawing up a list of academically weak students. With her class being conducted online since March 2020, Kadam said that it was becoming a big challenge for the students. “Last year, all these students passed without proper assessments and this year too, the same will repeat. However, there are a few students who are lagging behind their other counterparts in terms of learning key concepts. We are now working on these students to bridge the learning gap that has been seen due to online learning,” said Kadam. As schools and colleges remain online for more than a year now, understanding and evaluating the academic performance of students and taking corrective action is becoming one of the biggest challenges for teachers and schools. In 2020, students from Classes 1 to 8 were promoted based on internal assessments conducted at the school level. Class 9 and 11 students underwent tests and exams online. Those who failed to clear these exams had to undergo another round of tests in the days to come. Students in colleges and universities had to undergo online multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to pass their semesters. This year, students of Class 1 to 12 barring Class 10 and 12 will be promoted to the next class without any exams. ‘Can have disastrous consequences’Experts said that not being able to conduct assessments of students can have disastrous consequences on their overall learning outcomes of students. Sudam Kumbhar, former principal of Shailendra High School in Dahisar said that the consequences are particularly alarming for students from low-income households. “In families with low economic means, the children have already suffered a lot due to the pandemic. There are anxieties about employment and overall existence. In online classes, nearly 50% of students are often absent because they are accompanying their parents to their workplaces or have no access to phones and gadgets. It thus becomes crucial to assess the learning levels of such students which will not happen systematically because there are no exams and assessments,” added Kumbhar. Over the last year, a large number of students from colleges and universities who were previously struggling to get their backlogs cleared have managed to pass, said colleges. This is particularly a cause of concern because there is no way to know whether these students have merely passed the exams or have understood the subject during this time.“Every year, some students in every class end up with ATKT (allowed to keep terms) which they carry forward to the next semester. In some cases, students carry forward their KTs for two years but all this changed with the MCQ format of exams. While students have passed the exam, we are doubting how much of the subject they’ve realistically understood,” said the principal of a suburban college. Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra said, “Even though most students in our institute have scored very well, teachers are worried that students have not understood basic concepts and this will affect their ability to understand larger concepts in the future courses/subjects.”Lack of learning continuityIn December 2020, Leadership for Equity, a Pune-based NGO that works closely with the state education department conducted a community survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on learning. The sample survey conducted across six districts in the state (Pune, Akola, Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik) revealed that one of the biggest repercussions of prolonged school closures was the lack of learning continuity among students. A large number of parents and teachers expressed concerns about learning losses as only about two of the 10 students surveyed, reported having access to a phone during their study time. In eight of the 10 households, more than one person was sharing a phone thus raising concerns about the reach of online learning. Standard guidelines are importantFrancis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network said that in the days to come, it is important to have consistency and universality in strategies used for bridging the learning gaps. “Right now, each school is working on addressing issues arising out of online learning at its level as per its understanding. We need to understand that school leaders are not necessarily experts in pedagogy and thus boards need to come up with a set of standard guidelines for this. We need to understand that under the current circumstance, the entire schooling system needs to slow down a bit and rework its entire structure to make it easier on students for the coming 2-3 years. The repercussions of the losses during the pandemic will have to be dealt with even in the years to come,” he added. Trial by error learningThe sudden change from regular classes to the virtual mode affected teaching as well as learning modules across higher education institutes. Several colleges started training teachers before starting regular lectures but for a large chunk of teachers, learning was trial by error. “Most colleges were waiting for the University of Mumbai to announce the course of action, and once the announcement to start classes in the virtual mode came through, colleges were unprepared. Many of us understood the virtual classroom on our own by making many mistakes and learning from them,” said a senior professor from a suburban college. While theory sessions were conducted smoothly by colleges, practical sessions were a challenge for many. “We used the best technology possible and recorded videos of practical sessions for students, which were shared regularly. In case some students did not understand the concept, we allowed them to physically report to the college and conducted practical sessions keeping social distancing in mind,” said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, Churchgate. She added that students preferred depending on virtual classes as compared to physical classes as many were back in their hometowns and travelling would’ve been a problem. Increase in learning inequalitiesEducationists said while assessing the performance of students is a tough task without conducting periodic tests and exams, governments need to understand that learning losses due to the pandemic is a very critical concern. “Like always, it is going to increase learning inequalities. Those who can afford the best tutors and help will sail through. For families where retaining children in schools is a challenge, these learning losses would pose challenges in future as students have to compete for various exams,” added Kumbhar.“For the poor, their marks are the only gateway to a good education and if learning is not equal, we cannot test students on the same levels for sure,” said a teacher."
277,Maharashtra varsities to conduct exams only in online mode: Higher education minister,"All state public universities will conduct their exams, including final-year exams, in the online mode, said state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant, in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases across Maharashtra.“While most of the university exams were anyway being held online, there were a few places where offline options were also available. But considering the strict restrictions of lockdown from April 22, this will not be possible. Such universities had approached the department seeking permission to hold all exams completely online, following which the decision was taken. All universities and colleges have been instructed to ensure that no student misses the online examination,” said Samant adding that this decision was taken after discussing the options with the chancellor of all state universities, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Recently, several scheduled examinations had to be postponed due to the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country. School education boards including Maharashtra state, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as well as Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) decided to cancel their Class 10 board exams and postpone Class 12 exams this year. Similarly, the National Testing Agency (NTA) postponed all-India competitive exams indefinitely.University of Mumbai (MU) had released a circular in March clarifying that all university exams will be conducted in online mode in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format. “Not just theory exams, but affiliated colleges have also ensured that practical exams are conducted online. So, we have nothing to worry about,” said a senior official from MU. Similarly, most state universities have already announced that exams will be held in the online mode owing to the latest lockdown situation across the State.“Safety of staff and students is our focus, and we will make sure no student is at a loss due to the current situation. We have also been in talks with the authorities to get all teachers and other non-teaching staff to get vaccinations on priority so that the examination and results process is not hindered,” said Samant. He added that the education department also hopes to get all 3.7 million students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate courses in state universities vaccines on priority."

278,"Taking steps to give drugs, oxygen: Mumbai civic body tells HC","On a day when the Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of the Covid-19 situation in the country and issued a notice to the Centre, the Bombay high court (HC), while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the mismanagement of the second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra, was assured by the state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that appropriate measures were being taken to ensure equitable distribution of life-saving drugs and oxygen. As the HC hearing was on, additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that a web portal had carried a report that the Chief Justice of India had taken suo motu cognisance of all Covid-related public interest litigations (PIL) being heard by high courts and had decided to hear all petitions together on Friday, with senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae. Singh informed the court that it could not continue hearing the case further and that the Supreme Court will deal with supply of oxygen, essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and powers of the state to declare a lockdown. However, as the SC was yet to issue an order staying the hearing in the HC or seeking transfer of petitions, the HC bench continued the hearing. The HC bench, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was taking urgent steps to combat the spread. Pointing to the shortage of oxygen and life-saving drugs like Remdesivir, he submitted the Centre had announced that it would take care of it from May 1. On a query by the court on the availability till April 30, Kumbhakoni submitted that measures such as asking suppliers to hand over the medicines directly to the collector who, in turn, would distribute it to hospitals were put in place. To this, the court said there has to be a portal on availability of essential Covid-19 drugs. Referring to a news report from last year which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, “Had we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have arisen.” “You should realise this is an emergency situation,” said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should also be stopped. With regards to availability of Covid-19 tests, the state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing and having a uniform rate for the medicines would be considered. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether the RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients. “The shortage is because the middle class and upper class are now affected and they want a bed in a hospital of their choice. When the same is not available, it is depicted as shortage, while closeby hospitals may have vacant beds,” said Kumbhakoni. The court accepted the suggestions of Purohit and advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for an intervener, on the use of print and electronic media to spread awareness on the measures and to curb panic.The court also sought to know from the state the effects of Covid-19 on smokers and said that till the virus was not eradicated completely, the state and Centre should consider banning smoking and consumption of tobacco products. Reacting to the Nashik oxygen leak that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday, the court said, “How can this happen in a civilised society? While the oxygen supply is less, there is leakage. It is of concern. This is not what we expect from a responsible government.” The HC said the Centre and state should set aside politicking and concentrate on tackling the problems. The court has scheduled the next hearing on May 6. "
278,"Willing to touch Centre’s feet for oxygen supply, says Maharashtra health minister","With hospitals still turning away patients owing to shortage of oxygen supply, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said he was in touch with the Central government to solve the problem, and was even willing to “touch their feet”. “We want the Centre to facilitate a green corridor to provide a safe transport system for our oxygen supply. We are making a humble request to the Central government and are ready to even touch their feet. We urge the Centre to provide a maximum supply of oxygen to Maharashtra,” said Tope.Mumbai is currently receiving 235 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, although its daily requirement is 300 MT; Nagpur is getting 155 MT daily, despite its need of 180 MT; Pune needs 375 MT, but can garner just 300 MT daily; while Nashik, which needs 125 MT, gets just 85 MT daily. As of now, the state requires 1,500 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen daily, against its production capacity of 1,250 MT. The state is procuring 300 MT from other states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. The government has requested the Centre to increase the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) supply from other states to 500 MT daily. It is also expecting 105 MT oxygen by way of Oxygen Express train from Vishakhapatnam.There are reports that many Covid patients who are unable to get oxygen beds are now procuring oxygen cylinders at home as a temporary measure. To deal with the shortage, the state is considering using oxygen being produced at steel and thermal power plants. Tope said that Covid-19 centres can be built near the four thermal plants of Parli, Paras, Koradi and Khaparkheda and oxygen supply can be made by connecting a pipeline."
279,Govt officials shirking from their responsibilities in pandemic: HC,"Nagpur: Irked over contradictory affidavits filed by the collector and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) joint commissioner over their failure to supply 10,000 Remdesvir as per its orders, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court censured the authorities for shirking responsibilities rather than saving the lives of Covid-19 patients who are dying in the absence of beds, essential medicines and oxygen in Vidarbha.

The judges have summoned the Central Drug Controller to attend Friday's hearing to explain steps taken to ensure proper and continuous supply of Remdesvir across India. âWe direct him to remain personally present, either physically or virtually, and apprise on the steps taken in exercise of his powers under the Drugs Control Act, 1950, to prevent hoarding, undue stocking and black-marketing of this drug,â the judges said.

âOn April 19, we had issued directives to the government to release Remdesvir vials for the city immediately. But, has been complied with only partially. Several reasons are given for non-compliance. We find that these officers have now started to shirk their responsibilities in giving succour and relief to Covid-19 patients,â a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Shreeram Modak said.

After facing the HCâs ire in afternoon, divisional commissioner Sanjeev Kumar informed the judges in a hearing â held late in the evening for only the second time in Nagpur benchâs history â in the same suo motu PIL based on TOI reports, that from April 19 to 21, about 5,245 vials were distributed that amounts to half the compliance of HC directives.

Kumar informed that Nagpur would receive 6,752 vials of Remdesivir drug. âAs soon as theyâre received, they would be fairly and equitably distributed among the government and private hospitals by the nodal agency,â he told the bench said.

The FDA joint commissioner earlier informed that there are seven pharmaceutical companies actively involved in Remdesvirâs production and all, barring Ghaziabad-based Jubilant, have assured supply of specific quantities. These companies send their stock to depots located in the city from where the product is distributed all over Vidarbha region.

âThe FDA informed that the problem has arisen owing to shortage in Remdesvir supply by the companies. Therefore, there is also scarcity in providing it to the patients. We had an extensive hearing of this matter. However, so far no concrete solution could be found regarding deficiency in Remdesvir supply and also oxygen to Vidarbhaâs Covid hospitals,â the judges said.

Apart from amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar who was assisted by Sejal Lakhani, the hearing was attended by collector collector Ravindra Thakare, NMC commissioner B Radhakrishnan, Vidarbha Hospitalsâ Association (VHA) Dr Anup Marar and Dr Anil Laddhad.

Earlier, assistant solicitor general (ASGI) Ulhas Aurangabadkar informed that Remdesvirâs total capacity is 88 lakh vials through seven manufacturers.

The expert doctors informed HC that this capacity is quite sufficient to cater to the needs of serious Covid patients in the country. They said if manufacturers are directed to streamline their supply process to all the states, there would be no shortage and eventually eliminate the malpractice of its sale in black-market.

âWe accept the expertsâ opinion and request ASGI to obtain instructions from the drug controller to ensure Remdesvirâs fair and equal supply by all seven companies, not only to Maharashtra or Vidarbha, but to the entire nation,â they said.

279,Mumbai: Gutted hosp moves HC against revoking of its provisional OC,"Bombay High Court at Mumbai is one of the oldest High Courts of India

Mumbai: A hospital at Bhandup, where 11 patients lost their lives last month following a fire, on Thursday approached Bombay high court, challenging a BMC order revoking its provisional occupation certificate (OC). Sunrise Hospital counsel Aabad Ponda on Thursday told a division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni that it has 250 beds for Covid-19 patients and oxygen supply. âConsidering the situation we are in, the hospital should be permitted to open and function,â Ponda said.

279,"Relook at decision of not allowing door-to-door vaccination for elderly, kids, Bombay HC tells Centre","Expressing concerns over the lack of any policy by the Central government for vaccinating specially-abled and senior citizens with severe disabilities, the Bombay high court (HC) observed that such persons cannot be left to die and directed the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) to relook at its decision of not allowing door-to-door vaccination for elderly and find a solution and way to get them vaccinated. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai-based lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari seeking directions to the Centre, the state government and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination facility for people over 75 years of age, the disabled and the bedridden, was informed that the MoHFW had filed an affidavit in response to the court’s direction in the earlier hearing. The affidavit stated that there could not be a door-to-door vaccination policy as it would lead to “high vaccine wastage and contamination leading to a reduction in efficacy”, and that the protocols on physical distancing and infection prevention, including a 30-minute observation period, would not be followed.The MoHFW affidavit had also stated that in the case of adverse event following immunization (AEFI), there could be a delay in reaching the health facility and managing that case may not be as per requirement. The affidavit also stated it was not mandatory to administer the vaccine close to an intensive care unit ( ICU), “The occurrence of serious/severe AEFI is very rare, which may not necessarily require admission into ICU. Hence, there is no such requirement for an ICU for the administration of vaccines.”After perusing the affidavit the court questioned, “There are ICUs in ambulances, you cannot keep a refrigerator? Where is the study that shows there will be wastage due to the time taken to reach the beneficiary? We expected a better affidavit with more facts and figures from the Centre. There needs to be a solution. You need to have a relook at it.”When additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh for the Union of India submitted that in case of co-morbidities, there would be a risk in door-to-door vaccination to senior citizens. The court observed, “This is choosing between the devil and the deep sea. You do not want patients with comorbidities to be given vaccines without supervision, but because they cannot come to the vaccination centre, you want them to suffer?... In our country, old people and children should be taken care of on priority...We cannot leave old people to die...It is upon us that our near and dear ones get vaccinated.”Thereafter, Kapadia urged the HC to pass orders to waive off mandatory documents like Aadhaar or PAN card for vaccination, however, ASG opposed it and said that some document was required for it. The court then observed, “If some person is living under the bridge, then will not he/she carry the disease? Then what do we do? Unless you start a drive to get an Aadhar card for everyone.” The court directed the MoHFW to have a relook at its decision and said that it would give ‘prima facie’ opinions on the five reasons given by the Centre for not being able to have a door-to-door policy for vaccination and posted the hearing of the PIL to May 6.

Mumbai: Bombay high court on Thursday asked the Centre to take a ârelookâ at its stand on doorstep vaccination for the elderly and bed-ridden and to consider a âvia mediaâ by May 6. âIf vaccination of elderly citizens by adopting a door-to-door vaccination policy is being avoided because they are aged and suffer from comorbiditiesâ¦the elderly citizens are literally being asked to choose between the devil and the deep sea. A policy which leads to such conclusion has to be viewed as arbitrary and unreasonable, for the elderly citizens are entitled to protection under Article 21 of the Constitution of India as much as the young and abled-bodied citizenry,â said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni.

A PIL filed by city lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari has sought home shots for those who very old and specially abled, besides a helpline to help book a slot.

281,Bombay High court quashes FIR against Pune reporter in Trademark infringement case,"The Bombay High Court has quashed an FIR registered by Pune city police against Prateek Goyal, a journalist with online news portal ‘Newslaundry’, for using the logo of ‘Sakal Media Group’ in two articles.

A division bench of the Bombay high court comprising Justice S S Shinde and Justice Manish Pitale, while quashing the FIR, said, “On the proper interpretation of Sections 101, 102 and 103 of the Trademark Act, it becomes clear that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the mere use of the registered trademark of the Sakal Media Group in articles authored by the petitioner and published by the news portal ‘Newslaundry’, do not fit into the definition of the false application of the trademark in relation to goods or services. Therefore, in the absence of ingredients of the offence being made out, even on admitted facts, the First Information Report could not have been registered…”

The complaint was registered at Vishrambaug police station on September 16, 2020, for an offence under Section 103 of the Trademark Act.

The Sakal Group had contended that the petitioner (Goyal) had committed an offence under Section 103 of the aforesaid Act by falsely applying the trademark of Sakal Group in two articles authored by him and published in “Newslaundry” on 27/03/2020 and 11/06/2020. The respondent argued that these were highly defamatory articles against the Sakal Media Group and that use of the official trademark of the Sakal Media Group and Sakal Times on these articles resulted in an offence under Section 103 of the Act.

Prior to lodging the complaint, a legal notice was sent to the petitioner on June 12, 2020, alleging that the Sakal Media Group was defamed by him and an amount of Rs. 65,00,000. was claimed from him. On September 3, 2020, the Sakal Media Group filed a suit for injunction against the Newslaundry Media Pvt. Ltd. The suit is pending in court.

The counsels for the journalist submitted that the trademark of Sakal Media Group was shown in the articles written by the petitioner and published on the news portal ‘Newslaundry’, only to indicate those specific articles pertained to the Sakal Media Group.

Counsels for Sakal Group, Neha Prashant and Yashowardhan Deshmukh argued that the petitioner had clearly falsely applied the registered trademark of Sakal Media Group by prominently showing the mark on articles published on the news portal ‘Newslaundry’. It was submitted that when the word ‘Sakal’ was clicked on online search, it led to the said articles authored by the petitioner and published on the news portal ‘Newslaundry’, thereby demonstrating that the offence under Section 103 of the Act was indeed committed in the present case.

Asked whether Sakal Group will approach the Supreme Court, administrative officer Mahendra Pisal, who had filed the FIR, said, “It is too early to comment.”

“Justice has been done…I am happy with the high court ruling setting aside the FIR,” Goyal said."
281,Mumbai: FIR on BJP spokesman for alleging person alive was cremated by BMC,"Representative Image

Mumbai: Bhoiwada police on Wednesday registered an FIR against BJP Mumbai spokesperson Suresh Nakhua for allegedly tarnishing BMCâs image.

In a tweet on Thursday, @mybmc said, âFact > Fast. A video, recently shared on social media falsely accused BMC staff of taking an alive patient to the crematorium. In addition to tarnishing the image of BMC, the video also created panic amongst citizens, owing to which an FIR has been lodged against the offender.â

Nakua is followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister Amit Shah on Twitter.

Police said Nakhua, who is into share trading, on April 20 tweeted a video of an alive patient being cremated in Mumbai. The video was uploaded on Twitter, stating, âA living man taken to cremation Centre by BMC. I think there might be some target from cremation Centres Maha vasuli Aghadi government.â

On April 22, in another tweet, Nakhua clarified that he had uploaded the video but was not aware of the location of the incident and could not verify it. âThis video was tweeted as it disturbed me immensely & to alert the authorities. There was no intention to cause panic. I regret the inconvenience caused to authorities and general public, if any, due to my act and my sincere apologies for the same,â he tweeted.

An assistant health officer from BMC lodged a complaint alleging that Nakhua did not give information about the video. âMy colleague tried to contact him. He said he will give information to senior officials. When deputy municipal commissioner Devidas Shrisagar sought information on the video he said he was out to get medicines for a relative,â said the complaint.

Senior inspector Vinod Kamble said police have served a notice to Nakhua and his statement was being recorded.

Nakhua refused to comment, claiming that the matter was sub judice.

281,Mumbai: Spl court acquits Rajan in 1993 blasts accused’s murder case,"Gangster Chhota Rajan

Mumbai: A special court on Thursday acquitted gangster Chhota Rajan and another accused , Jagannath Jaiswal, in the 2001 murder of Hanif Kadawala, a film producer and an accused in the 1993 blasts case. The duo was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

Kadawala, who was accused of transporting weapons to Mumbai on the instructions of Tiger Memon, was killed on February 7, 2001, in his Bandra office by three men. Two other accused were acquitted earlier in a separate trial. This is among the over 70 cases that the CBI took over after Rajan was deported from Bali in 2015. The 62-year-old, lodged in Tihar jail, is serving life sentence for the 2011 murder of journalist J Dey. Soon after Kadawalaâs murder in 2001, an FIR was registered at Bandra police station. Investigations uncovered the role of an organised crime syndicate. Hence, provisions of the stringent MCOC Act were invoked. A chargesheet was subsequently submitted against Jaiswal, Nitin Sawant and Ashok Kotian. In the chargesheet, Rajan, Guru Satam and Yusuf Kadari alias Bachkana were shown as wanted accused. Kadari was arrested. During trial, Jaiswal and Sawant jumped bail. The trial proceeded against Kotian and Kadari and they were acquitted in 2004. Jaiswal was arrested in May 2017 and Sawant was reported to be dead. The CBI submitted a chargesheet against Rajan in 2019 and the trial commenced. The investigating agency alleged that Rajan wanted to gain public sympathy and avenge the blasts.

Last year, the court rejected a plea by Kadawalaâs son, who wanted a relative to be tried as an accused in the case on the grounds that Kadari had told the victimâs family that the relative had given a contract for the murder. The motive was allegedly a property dispute.

However, the court said though the murder took place in 2001, the family had not suspected involvement of the relative till 2017. âIt is difficult to gather from the evidence placed by the prosecution under what circumstances the acquitted accused made statement to the son of deceased and his friend and what prompted him to give such a statement after a lapse of 16 years,â the court said.

282,"CBSE 12th board exam 2021: Make Covid testing mandatory for students, demand teachers","NAGPUR: Many CBSE school teachers feel that RT-PCR tests must be made mandatory for students before restarting Std XII practicals as itâs suspected that many asymptomatic students had attended school.CBSE schools had started with their practical tests from April 1 onwards, but then put everything on hold as Nagpur went into a âstrict restrictionâ mode.Deepali Dably, president of CBSE Staff Welfare Association, said a letter demanding mandatory RT-PCR tests will be given to both the Nagpur Municipal Corporation and the district collectorate. âBoth students and teachers can be asymptomatic and hence itâs a big health risk for all stakeholders. We all are aware that this virus strain is spreading at a very fast pace and is infecting people from all age groups. So itâs important that we take all the necessary precautions to safeguard our students and even teachers from the virus,â said Dably.A CBSE school teacher told TOI that some students did attend practicals even though they were positive. âWe come to know these things through their classmates. These kids anyway live their life on social media and so they always share such information either in a small Whatsapp group or during their group video calls to each other. Some of them will write on Instagram about parents becoming positive or a sibling. Thereâs nothing private about their lives anymore. So I am not speculating that positive students attended practicals, rather, I know it for a fact,â said the teacher.But since this information came a few days after the tests, teachers say they were helpless. Another teacher said, âWe have been telling our principals to make RT-PCR mandatory for all but they are more focussed on getting the practical exam over and done with. Now, these practical exams have been put on hold and I hope that the school management takes it seriously.âCBSE had earlier advised parents to take an âeducated viewâ on the issue. Speaking to TOI on this issue earlier, CBSEâs controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, âParents must be open about these things and inform the school if their child is positive. CBSE will not let any child suffer academically due to Covid-19. A second chance will be given, so no need to panic.âDably feels that voluntary disclosure wonât work. âThereâs no guarantee that people will tell the truth. So our best option is to get a test done and only the local authorities can enforce that. We will strongly plead with authorities to implement this rule before the practical exams restart,â said Dably."
282,Postponed board and competitive exams leave class 12 students anxious," Eighteen-year-old Aarya Tendulkar used to spend at least 12 hours a day studying and preparing for her Class 12 exams as well as the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) until March this year. NEET is an exam that over a million students take every year for admission to undergraduate medical courses in medical institutions, including premier ones like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), among others. Last year alone, 1.6 million candidates registered for the exam; less than half qualified. Tendulkar and several like her are well aware of how competitive the entrance exam is. This has been her routine since 2019: “My day would start at 6am and I would study continuously till 9am. After a 30-minute break I would once again start at 10am and study till 2.30pm. My coaching institute lectures are scheduled in the afternoon till 7pm, following which I would have my dinner and then revise what was taught in class for an hour or two before calling it a day.” However, the Ghatkopar resident feels in a bit of a limbo right now. On April 18, the National Testing Agency announced that Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains is postponed until further notice while the status of NEET, scheduled for August first week, is yet unknown. “I feel this preparation time will never end and that is leaving me more anxious than ever,” she said.Rising Covid-19 cases across the country has forced state and national school boards to cancel Class 10 board exams and postpone exams for Class 12 students. Similarly, entrance exams to all undergraduate professional courses have been pushed forward. IIT-Joint Entrance Exams (JEE-Mains) are usually held in April, followed by JEE-Advanced in May. NEET-UG too is scheduled for May every year. However, due to the national lockdown imposed last year, the exams were conducted between September and October 2020. This year, of the four sessions of JEE-Mains, two were held in February and March while April session has been postponed. Last year, by the time the national lockdown was imposed, most Class 10 and 12 students had been able to finish most of their board exams: Maharashtra state board Class 12 exams had finished; only one paper remained for those in Class 10; Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 and 12 board exams were done; and Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board students were promoted based on the exams already held. As a result, students sitting for competitive exams this year worry that they may now have to take multiple exams in a stretch. “My daughter has not taken a vacation in over two years because her focus was to prepare herself best for Class 12 and NEET exams. But last year has been tough for her physically and mentally, and the fact that exams have once again been postponed is leaving her more anxious with every passing day,” said Dr Bharat Shah, father of Manashvi Shah, 18. Shah joined integrated coaching classes after clearing Class 10 and has dedicated much of the past two years preparing for the all-India medical entrance test in the hope of becoming a neurosurgeon in the future. “Children have spent the last one year in front of a computer, and the constant postponement of exam dates are adding to the stress levels of already tired teenagers. As parents, we feel helpless,” said Nisha Parmar, mother of Advait Parmar, 17. Parmar could not appear for the second session of JEE-Mains in March as he was in quarantine after his father tested positive. “I re-registered for the April session and wanted to tick-off at least one exam of my list but now, the April session has been postponed and I am unable to focus on studies anymore,” he said. “Many Class 12 students are living in fear of falling sick during exams or not faring well in exams as many have lost the concentration to focus on exams with so much happening around them,” said Mumbai-based psychologist Seema Hingorrany. “Postponement of exams has calmed the nerves of many. However, students are also worried about the seemingly never-ending wait,” said Vinay Kumar, MD and CEO of Rao Academy, a city-based coaching institute. "
283,Mumbai: B’wood vanity vans keep cops cool amid rising heat,"MUCH-NEEDED RELIEF: The vans are a boon for cops on bandobast duty

Mumbai: Bollywood A-listers Taapsee Pannu and Kangana Ranaut would have decked out in here countless times. But for Mumbaiâs policewomen, taking a break in the cool comforts of a vanity van after work was unthinkable until now.

Six vanity vans have been provided by a vehicle dealer for police personnel deployed on bandobast duty in the sweltering heat. Each of the vans has separate sections for men and women and is fully air-conditioned.

âWe have put up nine check-points on Western Express Highway , between Dahisar and Goregaon, since the state government issued restrictions on movement to combat Covid. At each point, there are two officers and about 15 constables who work in shifts. As it gets too hot during the day, we have instructed our staff not to stand on the road for over 90 minutes at a stretch. They can take a break in the vanity van,â said additional police commissioner Dilip Sawant.

The biggest problem for personnel on bandobast is the lack of washrooms. For women, itâs even tougher when they are menstruating.

With malls and big retail stores shut, the police have nowhere to go if they want to use the washroom. There arenât enough public toilets and the nearest police station is a kilometre or two away from the check-point.

âIn my interaction with women personnel, they admitted to drinking less water so they wouldnât have to use the washroom. At that point, I decided to offer my vans for the police department,â said Ketan Rawal of Mumbadevi Vehicles that has provided all six vanity vans. Some of these vanity vans were diverted from film sets since shootings have been reduced in the wake of the pandemic.

Each van has three sections with washrooms, a bed and dressing table. Police personnel can change or take a short nap between shifts.

âConstables shouldnât feel that their superiors are seated in air-conditioned offices while they slum it out on the road,â said a senior police officer. A young woman constable told TOI that she felt taken care of.

Ordinarily, using the van would cost Rs 6,000 for 12 hours. For a big celebrity, the cost could escalate between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000. Rawal, on his part, said he does not intend to charge the police even if his business takes a slight hit.

Mumbai: Ahead of the stringent restrictions on travel and office attendance coming into force from Thursday evening, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a meeting with his cabinet colleagues and senior officials to discuss implementation.

At the meeting with deputy CM Ajit Pawar , home minister Dilip Walse Patil , director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey and chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, Thackeray directed them to ensure strict implementation of the curbs. âThe police were asked to ensure there were enough cops on the roads since it serves as a deterrent, but they were told that rather than using force and getting into arguments with violators, penal action should be taken,â said an official. Thackeray said the restrictions will lead to economic losses, hence it was important to implement them properly else it would be futile. âWe are keeping a close watch on the situation. If required, rules will be made more stringent in the coming days. The idea is to break the chain,â said public health minister Rajesh Tope.

The passage of only essential commodities and emergency services is permitted. Vehicles with only 50% capacities would be allowed with no standees in public transport facilities.

Though the cops have taken guard at the district border points, the administration team, including health officials, was yet to reach till the time of going to press. They were engaged in arranging facilities at Covid hospitals hit by oxygen shortage.

Itâs learnt that rapid antigen tests (RAT) would be conducted on the people with symptoms trying to enter the district. The district administration would also likely to stamp the hands of those entering the district for home quarantine. A formal order is yet to be issued.

The city police too had set up check-points at the eight places to restrict entries of outsiders. Office-goers have been asked to reach their workplaces by 10 am.

But due to vaccination, the number of serious patients is very low,” said a senior police officer from Mumbai Police."

285,"Mumbai records 2.5 lakh Covid cases in 2 months, 64% patients under 49 yrs","A health worker collects swab sample of visitors at the Gateway of India in Mumbai. (Express Photo by Ganesh Shirsekar)

Maharashtra capital has added more than 2.50 lakh new cases of Covid-19 in the last two months, a majority of which – 64% – are from the 0 to 49 age group, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has revealed.

The proportion of Covid-19 patients among the younger group in Mumbai is much higher in the second wave than the 56% recorded in the first wave in 2020, data showed.

However, the fatality rate in the 0-49 age group remains low as compared to people in the 50 to 90+age group.

Between February 20 to April 20 this year, Mumbai has recorded 2,51,386 fresh cases. Of this, 1,60,643 cases were from 0 to 49 years age group. According to the data, Mumbai has recorded 971 deaths in these two months, of which 91% were between 50 to above-90 age group.

The major chunk of Covid-19 patients belongs to people in the 30-39 age group with 53,588 cases. This is followed by 45,506 cases in the 40-49 and 44,374 cases in the 20-29 age brackets.

Officials agree that during the first wave, the infection rate among the young population was lower as compared to this year. Civic officials said there has been an increase in the infection rate among young children and teens between 10 to 19 years of age. According to the BMC data, in these two months, 12,889 people in the age group have been infected. This is much higher than the data until February 20, when 12,221 children and teenagers of 10 to 19 years age group were infected since the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020.

While in the first wave, it took seven months for the city to cross 2 lakh cases of Covid-19, this time the figure has been reached in just two months.

Experts said that even though the current wave has infected more young people, the mortality rate has remained low.

“More young people below 45 are getting infected this time. This is mainly because of them gathering in groups, leading to fast spread of the infection, and in some cases, hospitalization. However, they (the younger patients) have good recovery rates,” said Dr Avinash Supe, head of state government’s death audit committee.

Dr Supe warned against younger patients’ symptoms getting aggravated after a few days of infection. “Double mutant virus is there as we have seen in the change in clinical trends of the patients. We have seen younger patients fine for some days and suddenly, after seven to eight days, their symptoms aggravate.”

According to the data, 63 patients lost their lives from the age group of 40-49, followed by 18 deaths in the 30-39 age group.

Officials said that trends point at western suburbs being more affected by the new Covid wave than the city. Dr Supe said that this trend is less lethal but more infective. As per the data, as on April 20, total Covid case tally has reached 5.62 lakh. In this, 59% are among the 0 to 49 age group."
286,"CR, WR to cut locals by 20%; allow only essential workers in Mumbai","Representative image

Mumbai: Railway authorities have decided to run only 80 per cent of the services and restrict access to the stations as well as automated ticket purchase to enable only essential service workers to commute by local trains.

The travel restrictions under the âBreak the chainâ drive initiated by the state government will continue till May 1.

Central Railwayâs chief public relations officer Shivaj Sutar said, âWe have decided to run services as per Sunday timetable as the number of passengers travelling will decrease considerably.â

The authorities will be curtailing entry and exit gates and also disabling the issuance of tickets through automated ticket vending machines ( ATVM), ), as state government has permitted travel in local trains to only essential service workers.

The essential service category includes employees of state government, Central government and local self government.

Public sector bank staff will be allowed along with those in the medical profession. Passengers who are travelling for medical emergency will also be permitted to travel.

Season tickets and journey tickets will only be issued essential category passengers defined by the state government during this period.

Before start of second wave of the pandemic, CR used to carry 21 lakh passengers while WR ferried 17.5 lakh passengers per day.

Also, the number of entry and exit points have been closed. A official said, âThere will be limited entry/exit gates as we want to ensure that unauthorised passengers do not travel.â

WRâs chief public relations officer Sumit Thakur said, âRPF will work in coordination with GRP to ensure and prevent any unauthorised access to the station.â

286,Pfizer offers Covid-19 vaccine to govt at ‘not-for-profit’ price,"Mumbai: US drug major Pfizer said it will offer its Covid-19 vaccine at a ânot-for-profitâ price for the Indian governmentâs immunization programme. The company said it âcontinues to be in discussionsâ with the government, and remains âcommittedâ to making the vaccine available for deployment in the countryâs vaccination programme.The company is yet to reapply to the government for emergency authorisation for its vaccine, after withdrawing its application in February.Recently, the government decided to fast track approvals for foreign-produced Covid-19 vaccines authorised by global regulators, by doing away with bridging trial studies prior to regulatory approval. Vaccines approved by Western regulators including the USFDA, UKâs MHRA and WHO will be granted emergency authorisation here, with the company now conducting post-approval parallel bridging studies in place of local clinical trials.The company did not provide specific details about pricing for India. A company spokesperson said âIn all our agreements, Pfizer has adopted a distinct pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries consistent with our commitment to work towards equitable and affordable access for our Covid-19 vaccine for people around the worldââ.During the current pandemic, Pfizer says its priority would be to exclusively support governments through supply of its vaccine only to governments for their immunization programmes. âThis would be our approach in India as well,â the statement said.The company did not respond to a query on whether it will enter into agreements with hospitals that are keen to import the vaccine.Media reports say Pfizer has priced the messenger RNA vaccine around $10 in South Africa. Globally, as per contracts, the minimum price for the vaccine is $6.75 per dose, while the maximum is understood to be $23.50 per dose, according to the Global Health Centre. It costs about $20 (around Rs 1,500) per jab in the US.âPricing-information and terms and conditions of the agreement (e.g., timelines for delivery, liability arrangements) are not available for the vast majority of confirmed vaccine purchases. Not all agreements are being publicly reported in a timely fashion, and of those that are reported, they often lack basic information, such as the total number of vaccines being provided and their prices. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to draw firm conclusions about global access to Covid-19 vaccines,â the Global Health Centre says."
287,Recoveries remain high despite dip as cases surge again,"Nagpur: The district once again surpassed the highest daily cases within a day. A 7,344 new patients were recorded on Thursday. Though a high number of patients recovered, the tally decreased to 6,314 after posting a promising 7,266 within a day. This was the second-highest number of recoveries seen so far and within a span of one day.

For the second time this week, Covid deaths crossed the 100-mark with Nagpur rural recording perhaps its highest ever toll of 45 out of the 110 fatalities in the district. The city saw 58 deaths. Seven were from out of the district and passed away here.

At 75, the city had recorded its highest toll ever on April 19. The surge in Covid deaths took Aprilâs toll to 1,587. Last year, September held the record for the highest deaths at 1,465.

The 22 days of April have accounted for 1,24,895 cases which is the highest ever seen in any month since the pandemic started. The districtâs active caseload increased to an all-time high of 72,477, with more than 9,000 patients admitted in hospitals and CCCs.

As compared to a day earlier, the city saw a dip in daily cases. According to the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) data, 4,619 cases were reported on Thursday as against 4,787 on Wednesday. A sharp jump of over 300 cases shot up the rural dayâs tally to 2718, which also ultimately took the district figures to a new high.

The 2,718 fresh cases in rural parts were detected from 5,309 tests, making up for a 51.19 positivity rate. This comes at a time when the health infrastructure is badly stressed with patient load in periphery areas. The rural toll is also an indication of many patients not getting timely hospital admission, oxygen or necessary medication, officials said.

The cityâs new cases were detected from 16,276 samples, for a positivity rate of 28.37%, which is much lower than the rural.

The district has also crossed 20 lakh tests but it officials feel it canât be assumed that half the population has now been tested. Healthcare workers and frontline workers have to prefer repeated testing which are part of the tally as on date.

288,Pedestrians at core of Sitabuldi main road makeover plan,"Safety in times of Covid

Nagpur: Sitabuldi, the cityâs most bustling commercial pocket, promises to become pedestrian-friendly. The redevelopment of the 1km long Variety Square-Loha Pul Square Sitabuldi main road envisages earmarking 84% of the road space for pedestrians.Currently, a major portion of the Sitabuldi main road is gobbled up by hawkers, moving and parked vehicles, roadside venders leaving a mere 5% for the pedestrians. This are findings of a study carried out under âReimagining Sitabuldi Marketâ proposal prepared by Sumit Asia Architects, Nagpur (SAA) and The Blank Slate (TBS), Mumbai.As winners of the Street for People Challenge (an initiative by Smart Cities Mission, MoHUA, Government of India), architects and urban designers from SAA and TBS aim to transform the bustling Sitabuldi market into a vibrant public space for Nagpurians to grow, pause, reflect and express.The main challenge in this competition rolled out by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) was to expand the potential of the street by proposing new activities while placing maximum focus on enhancing the shopping experience.The overflowing pedestrian movement, increased vehicular traffic and on-street parking leads to a chaos on the road for almost the entire day.Sagarika Nambiar, an architect at TBS, said that the âVision Sitabuldi districtâ untangles the existing chaotic system to create a dynamic, vibrant, secure, and inclusive shopping street that encourages walking and gathering.The 30-metre wide road has been divided into eight lanes with a major portion dedicated for pedestrians, followed by hawkers and a smaller patch for eco-friendly motor vehicles. âFortunately, the immediate neighbourhood is well-equipped with secondary roads, vacant grounds (within 5-minute walking distance), and shared parking opportunities in the nearby malls,â the study mentions.Applying a low-cost high-impact design strategy, as a salient feature of âtactical urbanismâ, the distinct features were not only designed to allow better use of the street but also to provide a pleasant experience for the shoppers coming here. The safe and accessible crosswalks, a non-motorised vehicle (NMV) lane, e-rickshaw drop-off points, and pedestrian promenades are some features that figure in the proposed design.Also, there are provisions for an amenity plaza, dynamic linear park, pop-up events plaza, a hawkersâ plaza, and a food bazaar dispersed throughout the length of the street that offer new opportunities to expand the streetâs potential to make it one of the most happening marketplaces of the city.The locally-sourced design materials (plastic crates, khadi fabrics used as shading devices, reusable tyre planters, etc, street patterns (concentric circles and morse codes), and repeated modules provide visual cohesion along the entire length of the street.âRunning in tandem with our design proposal and timeline, a mobile application is also proposed which is a one-stop solution for all things one might want to know about Sitabuldi Street. Along with this, the application will also aid in collecting valuable feedback and opinions from the public over a social interface, rather than manually doing so on-site, decreasing the risk factor,â said Nambiar.The proposal is to create a public space that transforms from an outdoor fitness zone in the early morning hours to a crowded market street offering a dual-natured shopping experience all through the day and finally offering food street or a cultural fiesta at night.âIn this transformation, we find a spark that ignites growth of a sustainable city and a city that is human-centric and nature-based,â she said.In response to the pandemic, the design has plans for measures such as a morse code pattern and circles spaced out by 6ft on the pedestrian walkway to ensure physical distancing, sanitization booths, and public toilets to ensure health and safety, acrylic screens on vendor carts for a safe shopping experience etc."
289,How a group of cane growers grew a company from scratch,"Hailing from families of farmers whose main source of income was the cane crop, these men knew the crop like the back of their hand, Chormule said. (File)

In November 2019, when Ankush Chormule and his five fellow directors decided to launch Ganna Master — the speciality product aimed at better per acre yield for cane farmers, they had almost zero experience of markets. What they had was immense ‘on field’ practical knowledge about the cane crop.

Chormule and his fellow directors were traditional cane growers across the cane belt of South Maharashtra and North Karnataka and by virtue of their agricultural practices, were ‘champion farmers’. “As against the normal 50-60 tonnes per acre, our individual acreage was around 100 tonnes per acre. What we aimed to do with the Ganna Master Kit was share our package of practices with farmers so that they, too, can increase per acre yield,” said Chormule, whose family grows cane over nine acres in the village of Ashta in Walva taluka of Sangli district.

Even before they hit the markets, Chormule, who has a PhD in agricultural entomology, and his team was working with cane growers in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Through their Facebook group Hoy Amhi Shetkari (HAM), the team has been in touch with over 4 lakh cane growers across the sugar producing states.

Hailing from families of farmers whose main source of income was the cane crop, these men knew the crop like the back of their hand, Chormule said. Sugar mills pay farmers per tonne of cane procured, so higher the tonnage, higher the payment

“Besides basic minerals and nitrogen fixers, cane requires boosters and micro-nutrients to enable better growth and increase per acre tonnage. In our personal fields, we take spraying of amino acid, fulvic acid and cytokinins to accelerate the vegetative growth of cane,” he said. Similarly, potassium humate,vitamins and organic phosphates have given a good result in increasing the girth ratio and preventing cane from lodging, Chormule said. The directors, most of whom are administrators of Hoy Ami Shetkari group, have been guiding farmers through their Facebook page on how to improve agricultural practices.

“Of course, these act like tonics, the farmer should ensure the basic remains strong and he adheres to proper planning for the crop,” he said.

The team is advised by a retired soil scientist form the Mahatma Phule Agricultural University. Besides Chormule, the team includes Suresh Kabade, Amol Patil, Prakash Khot, Vijay Magdum and Prasad Pawar.

While working with farmers, the group had zeroed in on five chemicals, which gave the best result. The final kit has Master root, Master Bonus, Master Growth and Master Speed to be either sprayed or applied through water. Applied individually, these would cost Rs 1,000 per application but the Kit offers them same at Rs 2,600. Before going on the stalls, the kits were distributed free-of-cost to farmers to be applied over 300 acres. “The results were very successful…in fact, it was enough for us to launch our company,” he said. Before joining the company, Chormule was on the staff of a Singapore-based input company but resigned to join the Ganna Master Agro Industries Private Limited.

The company started with a modest investment of Rs 10 lakh and directors working from their homes. Social media, especially Facebook, was the platform of choice for spreading the word. “Our initial operations were restricted to the districts of Sangli and Kolhapur. But since then, we have spread to all the cane growing areas in Maharashtra, Karnataka and even in Uttar Pradesh,” said Chormule.

From selling 200 kits a month at first, the company now sells over 2,500 kits a month. The company has followed a very lean but organic model for growth. “Our aim was to reach the farmer directly. So, we have managed to keep the overheads less,” he said.

Hailing from families whose main source of income was farming, the group understood the complex economics of agriculture perhaps better than any one else. “We act as cane consultants but with firmer roots on the ground,” said Chormule.

Since its launch, the company has expanded its footprint and invested in packaging and a storehouse in Pune. This year, the company has launched on a trial basis Onion Master, Turmeric Master and Vegetable Master kits for other crops."

291,Chandrapur patients suffer for want of correct bed info,"Chandrapur: At a time when Covid-19 patients are dying for want of treatment and availability of beds, misleading information given through different administrative sources over beds is adding to confusion among the patients and their relatives.Officials sources like administration website, press communiquÃ© and the information given by the Covid helpline centre about availability of beds make contradictory claims.The official communiquÃ© signed by the district health officer claims that there are 1,371 beds in government and private dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH - 939 beds) and dedicated Covid health centres (DCHC - 432 beds).In reality, none of these facilities currently has beds for serious patients. The press communicque shows the availability of 136 beds at DCHC and 228 beds at DCH on Thursday evening.However, there is no differentiation of general beds, oxygen beds, ICU and ventilator beds mentioned in the press release.The official website of the administration district, Chanda.nic.in, shows that there are 1,253 beds in DCHC and DCH hospitals under government and private players. They include 357 general beds, 706 oxygen beds, 190 ICU beds and 88 ventilator beds. Presently, it shows the availability of 53 vacant beds, 48 of them general beds, 4 ICU beds and one oxygen beds. However, those at helpline desk claim that there are no oxygen or ICU beds available in district.At the Covid facility at womenâs hospital, the press communiquÃ© says there are 296 beds and all of them vacant. However, as per the helpline there are just 51 beds operational at the hospital which include 12 general, 18 oxygen and 21 ICU.

292,All eyes on 'Indian Variant' in Vidarbha 'that led to 2nd wave',"NAGPUR: The second wave of Covid-19 is now well underway in almost all parts of the country. While itâs still to come âofficiallyâ from Indian authorities, global attention is focusing on a new variant â B.1.617 â that appears significantly more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati , and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February.International researchers believe that this variant is typically of Indian origin . As a result, researchers and media houses from across the globe are now focusing on Vidarbha; and some of them even visited Nagpur while tracing the new âIndian variantâ.âItâs different than the UK, or Africa or Brazil variant, which have been discussed at the start of this wave,â said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been receiving inquiries from many international researchers and journalists about the second wave in India.âMany countries have imposed travel ban to India. UK has added India into âred listâ of restricted destination. This is because specific variant of the virus â B.1.617 â is becoming increasingly common,â said Dr Shinde. He believes the Amravati surge was also due to this variant, though it needs to be confirmed with more research.As per the data shared by Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), B.1.617 was first found in samples collected in December 2020 in India. They have data of genome sequencing of Indian samples up to April 3, 2021. Until then, this variant was visible in 29% of the samples in India. According to doctors, it is responsible for the second wave and is now spreading across the country.GSAID is recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers. In 2020, WHO called this data-science initiative âa game changerâ in Covid-19.Dr Atul Gawande, who hails from Umarkhed in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha, and is currently a member of Covid-19 control advisory team of US President Joe Biden , has also expressed his concerns about this variant while calling it as âextremely frighteningâ. âI am seeing this variant go through entire households of my family in India. Whether it is more lethal, and whether vaccines work well against it, remains unclear,â he said.As noted by Dr Gawande, it has been observed especially in Vidarbha that this variant is infecting entire families, unlike its predecessors in September 2020 wave. This means, the virus is significantly more infectious. But whether it is lethal or not is still to be studied. At present, the variant is âunder investigationâ. It is still not designated a âvariant of concernâ but scientists have recognized it as âvariant of interestâ.According to an initial study by Virology researcher Grace Roberts from Queenâs University, Belfast, this variant is estimated to be around 20% more transmissible than the earlier form of the coronavirus circulating during the first wave.However, officials in the ministry of health said that the rise in cases is not linked to the variant, as B.1.617 hasnât been detected in high enough quantities to determine whether it is directly responsible. However, experts think that this may be due to lack of data, and many have stressed the importance of increasing virus sequencing to get a better picture.The Indian VariantCovid-19 cases have risen sharply in India as new variant called B.1.617 has emergedB.1.617 is becoming increasingly common in Indiaâs cases, detected in second waveAmravati, and West Vidarbha, followed by Nagpur are identified as epicentre of B.1.617Due to this, global researchers have focused their attention on VidarbhaB.1.617 variant is more contagious, unlocks our cells, and skips pre-existing antibodies"
293,"Maharashtra taking urgent steps to combat Covid surge, HC told","The Bombay high court, while hearing a PIL questioning the mismanagement of the second Covid-19 wave in Maharashtra, was assured on Thursday by the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) that appropriate measures were being taken to ensure equitable distribution of life-saving drugs and oxygen.As the hearing was on, additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni that a web portal had carried a report that the Chief Justice of India had taken suo motu cognisance of all Covid-related PIL being heard by high courts and decided to hear all petitions together on Friday, with senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae.Singh informed the court that it could not continue hearing the case further and that the Supreme Court will deal with the supply of oxygen, essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and powers of the state to declare a lockdown. However, as the SC was yet to issue an order staying the hearing in the high court or seeking transfer of petitions, the HC bench continued the hearing.The bench, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that the state was taking urgent steps to combat the spread. Pointing to the shortage of oxygen and key drugs such as remdesivir, he submitted that the Centre had announced it would take care of it from May 1. On a query by the court on the availability till April 30, Kumbhakoni submitted that measures such as asking suppliers to hand over the medicines directly to the collector who, in turn, would distribute it to hospitals, were put in place. To this, the court said there has to be a portal on availability of essential Covid-19 drugs.Referring to a news report from last year, which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, “Had we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have been arisen.”“You should realise this is an emergency situation,” said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should be stopped. The state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing, and having a uniform rate for the medicines, would be considered.The state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all. Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients."

As Pune is reeling under increased Covid-19 infections, hotels and private institutions have restarted paid isolation centres for mild or asymptomatic patients who can’t isolate themselves at their homes, said Ganesh Shetty, president of the Pune Restaurant and Hoteliers Association. Around 40 hotels in the city have started such services.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has tied up with several hotels, wedding halls and other facilities to serve as Covid care centres to help isolate patients with mild symptoms, Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar said.

There are over one lakh active Covid-19 cases in Pune district. In the PMC areas, there are as many as 51,920 active cases. Dr Ashish Bharati, health chief of the PMC, said there are 2,000 isolation beds across six government-run Covid care centres, while another 2,500 beds will be added soon.

For this purpose, they have identified nearly 10 hotels and another 25 facilities, including wedding halls and recreation centres.

At present, approximately 10,000-11,000 new cases are being detected in Pune every day. Total 74,772 people are in home isolation and over 26,996 are admitted to hospitals that are witnessing a huge strain as a large number of patients with mild symptoms are trying to get admitted.

Business for the hotel and hospitality industry took a hit when the pandemic began last year. The state and the local administration eventually decided to use their services as institutional isolation centres at discounted rates.

Last year, hotels were also used to isolate those returning from abroad on the Vande Bharat flights. The package deal saw hotels charging a discounted rate for three meals along with room rent.

Shetty said the model has restarted in the city as the demand for isolation beds has gone up. “This is a paid model for those who want to isolate themselves from home. These centres are run in accordance with the government rules and authorities keep a tab on the health of patients on a daily basis. The hotel staff provide service with minimal contact or interaction with the guests,” Shetty said, adding that they are writing to the authorities for a special vaccination drive for the hotel staff.

“We can coordinate the same in a hotel where our staff can be vaccinated,” he added.

Other properties have also started converting themselves into isolation centres. Minal Gadia has recently converted his hostel near a prominent engineering college into a 200-bed isolation centre, of which 75 beds have oxygen facility.

“We would have a doctor and two nurses on each of our floor and all facilities would be provided to the patients,” he added."
294,1.24Lakh active cases projected for district by May 2,"Picture used for representational purpose only

NAGPUR: Covid-19 active positive cases are likely to surge to a new high of 1,23,680 in next 11 days in Nagpur district as per the state governmentâs projection. The government has calculated district will be short of 45,305 beds as per projected cases and directed the authorities to ramp up the infrastructure.

Active cases were 71,557 in the district on Wednesday. It means an increase of 52,123 by May 2 as per the projection. It also means the current surge continuing. The district is already having a severe shortage of oxygen beds. Situation of beds in ICU and with ventilators is even worse.

As per governmentâs projection, the district will be short of 10,476 beds with oxygen, 1,945 ICU beds and 520 beds with ventilators. Remaining shortage of 32,364 beds is in isolation facilities or Covid Care Centres (CCCs).

Since beginning of second wave, less than 1% of active patients have been in CCCs. The government had time and again directed the authorities to ensure 40% of patients are kept in CCCs for containing the spread and preventing deaths. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), district administration and Zilla Parishad (ZP) failed to comply with the directives saying patients were not ready to move into CCCs.

As against norm of having no more than 20% active patients in home isolation, the district has around 80%. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI, âWe are making all efforts to increase the beds with oxygen supply. Two Jumbo Covid Hospitals with 1,600 beds and new Covid Hospitals are proposed.â

Infectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, âAccess to medical care is very necessary to control deaths. District should have been equipped with necessary number of beds by now as the second wave has lasted 12 weeks in other countries. We are witnessing second wave for last nine weeks and it is likely to go on until end of May. Vaccination and full lockdown are not likely to work as district is facing community spread. Need is to develop makeshift facilities where people can get oxygen, CT scan, diagnosis and treatment on time.â

Except Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are likely to face severe shortage of beds as per projected active cases.

Active cases in the district on April 19 (76,961) were 354% more than highest number in first wave (21,746). Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is at fourth place after Pune, Mumbai and Thane.

Two districts of Vidarbha- Bhandara and Chandrapurâ are on top as far as weekly growth rate of the cases is concerned. Weekly growth rate of Bhandara is 3.63% and Chandrapurâs 3.48%. For Nagpur it is 2.24%, probably due to high number of cases in last month. Except Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are in the red category in weekly growth rate.

Nagpur district (3,22,091) is second after Mumbai (4,11,998) in testing per million population. Bhandara (2,02,934) is fifth and Wardha (1,86,022) sixth. Remaining eight districts are in the red category due to less testing.

Three Vidarbha districts Nagpur (35.02%), Gadchiroli (34.3%) and Gondia (33.23%) are in red category as far as weekly test positivity rate is concerned.

After Kolhapur, Bhandara and Nagpur districts are in second and third place for vaccination of 45-plus population. Coverage is 41.48% (1,57,442 vaccinated against 3,79,532 eligible persons) in Bhandara district and 41% (6,48,541 vaccinated against 15,81,800 eligible persons) in Nagpur district.

294,Wardha co’s Remdesivir to be in market in two weeks,"Nagpur: Genetek Lifesciences has started the process of manufacturing Remdesivir injections at its MIDC Sewagram factory in Wardha district after Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared its loan licence from Hetero Labs Ltd.

The pharma company, owned by Mahendra Kshirsagar, is expected to start the market release of the drug in another two to three weeks with an optimum production of around 30,000 vials per day.

US-based Gilead Sciences had licensing agreement with seven Indian pharmaceutical companies including Hetero Labs to produce Remdesivir.

Genetek, which already produces several life-saving drugs, was granted FDA permission following the initiative of Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The proposal of Genetek to manufacture the anti-viral drug was also cleared by the drugs controller general of India earlier.

Chetan Marwah, principal correspondent of Genetek, said, âWe have started procurement of raw materials, active and inactive ingredients from parent company.â

âThe vials, the printing of the packages and labels too has started,â said Marwah claiming that the entire machinery was geared up for the production. âIt will take around a fortnight or so to launch the product in the market. In mock runs, the production capacity may fluctuate but in the long run it would 30,000 per day. The drug would be released in the market through proper channel,â he said.

Marwah also said there would be no compromise on quality though some of the lengthier processes are likely to be shortened for a quicker release of the drugs needed to fight the pandemic. âThe drug would be put through all necessary and mandatory tests and trials before release,â he said.

295,"Multiple big centres, odd-even slots, crowd mgmt needed for 18+ vax drive","Nagpur: Ahead of the vaccination drive for 18+, city doctors feel that the administration must set up multiple big centres, stop on the spot registration, form squads as seen during polio drive and administer the jab with strictly prior appointment only during given time slots.

Previously, the city has witnessed intense crowding at inoculation centres each time a new group was allowed vaccination. With daily cases and deaths rising, there is fear psychosis among public, and hospitals are anticipating huge turn out from next month.

Pediatrician Dr Satish Deopujari said people are absolutely anxious about the upcoming drive. âWe will have to open up plenty of centres. Planning must be such that crowding is avoided. Odd and even hours can be adopted for the new group. We will have to create slots in time and space. It could be for women and men, and age-wise. Every area must have its multiple centres where residents can get vaccinated there only and need not travel outside. As a country, we are experts in handling masses. If we really organize it well, I donât think it will a challenge,â he said.

Niranjan S Joshi, senior manager, Marketing & Corporate Communication, Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, too said government should increase the centres. âVaccination should be done by prior appointments and with time slots. More slots should be given to elderly than youngsters as they are more vulnerable. Each centre should have limited numbers every day. Like polio vaccines, NMC and the govt should form squads which can visit particular areas and vaccinate people at home,â he said.

Critical care specialist Dr Imran Noor Mohammad said multiple big vaccination centres on open spaces must be set up. âTo avoid crowding, cops can be deployed and at a time only one beneficiary must be allowed to go inside the vaccination room,â he said.

However, KRIMS director Dr Ashok Arbat said he doesnât feel there would be problem of crowding. âPeople will come with appointment as the new group is more tech savy. So naturally the rush will be less. It may be a different scene when the vaccine will be sold over the counter. Those working may have to adjust timing but between the 18 to 25 group can take the jab any time,â he said.

Dr Arbat added that people are not coming for vaccination because of the lockdown.

They may venture out for silly reasons but will not go for vaccination. They should be motivated to take the jab,â he said.

297,"Lured by iPhone and jewellery, 60-year-old woman cheated of Rs 4 crore by ‘Facebook friend’","An FIR in this regard was registered at Cyber Crime Police Station of Pune City police after the woman, sensing trouble after making the last of her transactions in the first week of April, approached them, officers said.

A 60-year-old woman working at a very senior position in a private firm in the city was cheated of Rs 4 crore by online fraudsters on the pretext of receiving an iPhone, jewellery and foreign currency. An FIR in this case was registered at the Cyber Crime Police Station of Pune City Police recently, police said. An officer from Pune police said this is probably one of the highest sums of money that an individual has lost in a gift fraud case being probed in the country.

According to police, the woman received a friend request on Facebook in April last year from a person claiming to be in Britain. Over the following months, the complainant and the online fraudster exchanged phone numbers and connected with each other on WhatsApp, police said.

Some time around the complainant’s birthday, the complainant was told that she had been sent an iPhone as a gift, police said. A large sum of money was taken from the complainant on the pretext of customs clearance for the gift at Delhi Airport, police said.

Later, the complainant was asked to give more money in order to receive jewelry and foreign currency sent to her, police said. In as many as 207 transactions from two bank accounts, the complainant ended up transferring Rs 3,98,75,500 to online fraudsters for a plethora of pretexts given by the fraudsters to acquire her money, police said. The first transaction was made in September while the last one was made in the first week of this month, police said.

The woman’s ‘Facebook friend’ posed as someone in a prominent position by pretending to have assistants and accounts managers.

Inspector Ankush Chintaman of the Cyber Crime Police Station said, “We have launched a probe into the social media accounts, phone numbers and bank accounts used by the online fraudsters.”

298,Inhaled budesonide in early treatment reduces need for urgent medical care: Lancet study,"The onset of Covid-19 is usually mild, providing a potential window to intervene before the development of severe disease. (Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)

Inhaled Budesonide, a steroid used to treat asthma, if given early to Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms, scales down the need for urgent medical care and reduces recovery time, a new study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine has said.

The steroids in Covid-19 (STOIC) trial potentially provide the first easily accessible effective intervention in early treatment of Covid-19, researchers have said.

Sanjay Ramakrishnan from the Nuffield department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, UK, and lead author of the study, said the phase 2 clinical trial was done in the community in Oxfordshire, UK, and the aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the widely used inhaled glucocorticoid budesonide in individuals with early Covid-19 infection in the community.

The onset of Covid-19 is usually mild, providing a potential window to intervene before the development of severe disease. From July 16 to December 9, 2020, 146 participants were randomly assigned — 73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide.

The study results showed that inhaled budesonide significantly reduced the risk of urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation versus the usual care arm by 91 percent.

Dr Sundeep Salvi, chair at the chronic respiratory diseases section for the Global Burden of Disease Study for India, (who is not attached with the Lancet study) told The Indian Express that the study results have come as a pleasant surprise as an asthma drug can help alleviate some of the suffering of Covid-19 patients.

“It is important to remember here that the trial participants were people with mild symptoms and did not include those with severe symptoms or hospitalisation. The study has shown the use of inhaled budesonide in early mild cases has a 90 per cent chance of preventing hospitalisation,” Dr Salvi, who is also on the board of directors of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, said. It can be a potential game changer, which is widely available and safe, Dr Salvi added.

In the Lancet study, patients in the budesonide arm received a budesonide dry powder inhaler at a dose of 800 μg twice a day. Participants, administered budesonide, were asked to stop taking the inhaler when they felt they had recovered or if they had a primary outcome (Covid-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation).

Inhaled budesonide was taken for a median duration of seven days in the study. In the other group, the usual care was supportive therapy, with the National Health Service (NHS) advising patients with Covid-19 symptoms to take antipyretics for symptoms of fever (products containing paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as aspirin and ibuprofen) and honey for symptoms of cough.

Inhaled budesonide in early Covid-19 infection significantly reduced the likelihood of requiring urgent care, emergency department consultation and hospitalisation, the study results showed.

In another updated interim, analysis (published in medRxiv preprint by authors from the same group at Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine and Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford) showed that inhaled budesonide reduced the time to recovery by a median of three days in people with Covid-19 with risk factors for adverse outcomes."
298,Steroids saved you from Covid? Now save yourself from side effects,"Nagpur: Many Covid-19 patients are recovering from moderate and severe level of the disease with the use of steroids. While there could be different views among doctors about prescribing steroids, many of them are giving these drugs to some patients who continue to be ill even in the second week of Covid-19 infection. Presently, steroids are proving life savers for many who have defeated the virus on the basis of these drugs.But, while celebrating victory over Covid-19, one must remember the known side-effects of steroids and also techniques to safeguard from those side-effects. Doctors told TOI that patients who recovered from Covid-19 with the help of steroids may suffer from avascular necrosis, some six months to 2 years down the line. Secondly fungal infections like Mucormycosis are aggressively spreading in such patients.âItâs a known fact that use of high-dose corticosteroids is a common cause of avascular necrosis. This necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced,â said orthopedic surgeon Dr Aashay Kekatpure.âEarly diagnosis needs detailed clinical evaluation. The early changes in hip are seldom picked on X-ray, so MRI is considered the investigation modality of choice. Patients having history of diabetes, alcohol intake are more at risk of necrosis,â he said.According to him, recovered patients of Covid treated with steroids needs to be attentive to joint pains and aches. They should not avoid any symptoms like pain in center on the groin, thigh or buttocks. If neglected, it may cost a hip joint replacement surgery.Another ill-effect of the Covid-19 steroids is fungal infection of sinuses leading to Fungal Sinusitis caused by Mucormycosis which can be grave. âWith headache, nose blockage, black discharge from nose, tooth pain, loose teeth, facial pain, heaviness and facial swelling being chief and initial symptoms of the sinusitis, one must not ignore this at any point of time in this colossal Covid crisis,â said Dr (Major) Vaibhav A Chandankhede, from ENT Department of IGGMCH.âItâs necessary to report early for an early diagnosis and evaluation to minimise and control the disease of this opportunistic co-infection. As it just canât be delayed as neurological ailment or neglected for a usual headache. Treatment is both medical and surgical,â he added.TOI had reported on April 3 that mucormycosis cases are increasing in Nagpur since couple of months. They are accounting to 20 cases per 1,000 patients approximately."
299,PMC planning to set up two vaccination centres in each electoral panel,"The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is preparing a master plan to launch the third phase of the vaccination, in which every one above the age of 18 years will be vaccinated. The PMC will set up at least two vaccination centres in each of the 41 electoral panels of the civic body. But elected representatives are urging the civic administration to start vaccination centres in colleges to vaccinate the student population.

Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar on Thursday held a meeting regarding the master plan. “The third phase of the vaccination drive is going to be very extensive as it will include the maximum population of the city. The union government has made everyone above 18 years eligible for vaccination, so it means all those eligible for voting will be able to get vaccinated. So, the PMC is planning vaccination electoral panel wise,” said the civic officer.

The PMC has started more than 100 government vaccination centres across the city, he said, adding, “Now, the focus will be to ensure that each of the electoral panels in the city has at least two government vaccination centres. We will start new vaccination centres on priority basis in electoral panels where there is no or only one government vaccination centre.”

Meanwhile, elected representatives have been urging the civic administration to start a vaccination centre in the electoral areas represented by them. “The civic administration has received a list of proposed 230 locations for vaccination centres from elected representatives,” a civic officer said.

Rupali Dhadwe, chairperson of the women and child welfare committee, has urged the municipal commissioner to start vaccination centres in colleges as a large number of the college population is eligible for vaccination in the third phase. “There will be crowding in the vaccination centres as a large population will be eligible for vaccination from May 1,” she said, adding that the college administration will help in holding vaccination camps and the civic administration will have to only provide medical manpower for the purpose.

The PMC can also start vaccination centres in civic schools so that crowds will be distributed in multiple centres, Dhadwe said.

Dhadwe has requested the civic administration to start vaccination centres on the lines of polling booths during elections. “The community hall or clubhouse of a large cooperative housing society should be used to set up vaccination centres. This will simplify the vaccination process and be convenient for residents,” she said."

336,"In Ludhiana, patients’ kin scramble to source out-of-stock tocilizumab injections"," Ludhiana district, which had already been reeling under shortage of Covid vaccines, is in for another challenge — unavailability of tocilizumab, a drug which according to studies might reduce the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or death in patients with severe infection. To top it all, hospitals are expressing helplessness and asking the attendants of patients to arrange the medicine. The sudden dearth of drug has led to a mad rush among the patients’ relatives as those ‘not so resourceful’ are frantically calling their friends and looking for some ‘influential contact’ to source the medicine. Social media platforms are flooded with distress messages and requests for tocilizumab. Rishi Sood, a drug trader, said, “There already is an acute shortage of beds for Covid patients. If one becomes available, then the relatives have to run from pillar to post to arrange medicines such as tocilizumab. The drug is currently not available.” It is not the first time that the city hospitals are facing a tocilizumab crunch. In August last year too, when the Covid cases had begun to peak, the drug marketed by a Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company as Actemra was sold in the black market for nearly 40,000. GS Chawla, general secretary of the Chemist Association of Punjab, has claimed that there is an acute shortage of remdesivir, while tocilizumab is not available across the country as its salt is sourced from abroad while the medicine is being manufactured in India. “The government has taken the distribution of the medicine under its control and it is being allocated to the hospitals as per the requirement,” he added.Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, director, gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital, Ludhiana, and technical adviser, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), blamed hoarding for the current crisis.“There is no stock available in the hospitals and we keep hearing stories of how a handful of people are putting lives at stake by hoarding the medicine. It is a war-like situation and unfortunately, we are on the frontline without ammunition. The crises have been created due to unnecessary hoarding, perhaps for petty monetary gains. People should act responsibly and help each other. It is the only way we can win over the virus,” said Dr Chhina.Dr Amit Gulrez, deputy medical superintendent, CMCH, also said the stocks of tocilizumab have dried up. “There are patients who need tocilizumab, but we have been told that it is not available anywhere. The injection is used to treat Covid patients when they fail to respond to any other treatment in a critical stage and are in respiratory distress.”However, senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is a member of the Covid taskforce of the state, said new findings and treatment protocols have suggested alternative treatments if tocilizumab is unavailable.“So we have to look for an alternative. But at the same time, concerted effort should be made to spread awareness among people to stop hoarding life-saving drugs,” he added.SMO Dr Hitinder Kaur said while there is adequate stock of remdesivir, tocilizumab is not available for long. She said the medicine was earlier used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, which is now being used for critically ill Covid patients.Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state government has floated tenders and within a few days, tocilizumab will be available. Meanwhile, the Ludhiana health department received 40,000 vaccines on Thursday to replenish its stocks. On running out of its vaccine stock, the Ludhiana health department had suspended the vaccine supply to private hospitals in the district till further orders on April 20.Sharing details, district immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said they have received 40,000 Covishield vaccines on Thursday from Chandigarh for the smooth conduct of vaccination process.He said that the current batch of vaccines will be used only at the government-run centres. After running out of both Covidshield and Covaxin vaccines, the supply to 85 private hospitals in the district, which were also inoculating people, was stopped.With 80 patients admitted to the Ludhiana civil hospital’s Covid ward, 52 of them on oxygen and 14 on ventilator support on Thursday, the facility is staring at serious manpower crises.The issue of staff scarcity came to the fore after SDM (East) Dr Baljinder Singh Dhillon expressed concern over the shortage of nurses and attendants at the civil hospital and asked for urgent recruitment of 20 paramedical staffers.SMO and Covid unit in-charge of the hospital, Dr Hitinder Kaur, said, “We have adequate staff to run the health services in mother and child hospital and emergency services, but the sudden rise in the number of Covid patients has mounted extra pressure on us.”“Currently, the staffers are working in three shifts. We have arranged staff from other government hospitals and primary health centres, but that is not enough. For ICU duties, we need to have three times the existing staff strength,” she added.Bhupinder Kaur, nursing in-charge of the civil hospital, said besides the staff shortage, there were other challenges as well. “Sometimes, the nursing staffers get infected or their family members contract virus and then they cannot perform duty for the next 17 days.

Under the allocation, the Government of India had decided to send 13,400 doses to Punjab.Also, the state health department has placed an order of additional 8,000 doses from private firms, which they are expecting to receive in coming 2-3 days, to ensure easy availability of the anti-viral drug in government and private hospitals.“Remdesivir is not available in Patiala hospitals, both government and private, while its demand is increasing with every positive patient. We have made requests to the state health department to ensure its availability in the market so as to avoid black marketing and hoarding,” said Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh, adding that due to shortage, some healthcare officials are demanding thousands of rupees for one Remdesivir dose.Till Thursday evening, there were around 40,584 active Covid-19 cases in Punjab, of which nearly 508 are on oxygen support. Health experts believe that even the 21,400 Remdesivir doses may fall short in the next ten days as the state is reporting a new spike of infection daily.“Remdesivir is basically an experimental drug for use, the efficacy of which has not been proven yet. But still, being the only anti viral drug available in the country, people are purchasing it from private chemist shops at high price. The injection is given to moderate and severely ill patients but it is not a life saving drug. Also, there is no confirmation that it will reduce hospitalisation hours or will decrease the chances of mortality. The people, who are spending thousands of rupees on a single dose or are black marketing the stock of Remdesivir, is completely illogical”, said state nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added: “At present, we have 750 doses of Remdesivir in state’s government and private hospitals and the daily usage of the anti-viral drug is 40 to 50 doses, across the state. However, as people are searching for the injection in the market, we will ensure its easy availability for which 21,400 doses are awaited. We will distribute its stock to each district, according to positive case load and active cases. The districts’ officials will then supply it to government and private hospitals. Also, the state has enough stock of other equipment and drugs needed for Covid-19 treatment.”"
342,Medical oxygen demand likely to shoot up to 150 MT in 2 weeks: Punjab to HC,"The Punjab government on Thursday told the Punjab and Haryana high court that even as central government has failed to provide promised medical oxygen to Punjab, the demand for the same is likely to shoot up by 40 metric tonnes in next two weeks.Health secretary, Punjab, Kumar Rahul told court that Punjab has a storage capacity of 300 metric tonnes and daily consumption recorded as on April 20 was around 110 MT. It is expected to rise to around 150 MT in next two weeks as per projections of case load and this could increase further given the way the Covid upsurge is, the court was told, adding that daily availability of medical oxygen as of now was 115 MT and to meet the demand in view of surge has become a challenge as state does not have a plant of its own. There is disruption of supply of oxygen in few districts as Centre has not been able to supply promised 126 MT, it has told court, adding that government has written to Centre to ensure that it gets 120 MT supply.The information was given during resumed hearing of a plea in which the high court is monitoring the Covid-19 outbreak situation in both the states and Chandigarh. The government has also said that bed occupancy in the state has gone up to 50% due to Covid surge. The state has 7,525 level-II oxygen beds and 2,064 intensive care unit beds with around 1,000 ventilators, it added."
342,Panipat unit supplies 171 MT oxygen to Delhi in 7hrs," The politics over supply of medical oxygen continued on Thursday with Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accusing the Haryana government of hindering oxygen supply to Delhi.Belying Delhi claims, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that over 170 MT medical oxygen, of the 140 MT allocated to Delhi has been supplied from Panipat’s Air Liquide plant.Officials said there was a distribution shortfall in terms of previous allocations which has been made up by the Panipat unit.As per official statistics, 171.85 MT medical oxygen was supplied to Delhi between 10pm on April 21 and 6am on April 22 to 13 customers in Delhi.The Delhi destinations included Indian Oil Corporation (8.23 MT), Seth Air Products (15.02 MT), Inox (15.1 MT), Goyal Delhi (9.10 MT), Kapil Enterprises (11.7 MT), Jalan Gases (10.43 MT), Paramount (16.29 MT), Devansh (11.61 MT), Shree Aggarsain Hospital (15 MT), Aggarwal Gases (10.54 MT), Multan Air (8.83 MT).Khattar said a roster has been prepared for filling of oxygen cylinders and loading in trucks. “One truck will be loaded for Haryana and one truck each for Delhi and Punjab. The entire process at Panipat plant is being closely monitored by me,” he said.Khattar said some difficulty was reported in supply of oxygen to Haryana, Delhi and other states from Panipat but now the problem has been resolved. “I held detailed discussion with PM Modi on this issue,” Khattar said.The Haryana CM said that he spoke to his Delhi counterpart, Arvind Kejriwal, who expressed satisfaction over supply of oxygen.Khattar said the Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT oxygen per day, of which, 140 MT is supplied to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana and 20 MT to Punjab.Haryana health minister Anil Vij said Sisodia’s grouse that district officials have been deputed at these installations to hamper movement of medical oxygen shows his lack of understanding.“Even as per the orders issued by Union ministry of home affairs on Thursday, the deputy commissioner and superintendent of police of a district will be personally liable for ensuring unhindered inter-state movement of medical oxygen,” Vij said.The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) had set up a Naphtha Cracker Complex in Panipat comprising of multiple units to produce different grades of polymers and plastics at Panipat.The cryogenic oxygen and nitrogen plant which feed oxygen and nitrogen gases to the Naphtha Cracker Complex has been set up by Air Liquide Industries, Belgium."
343,"Women’s safety, proper drainage on top of my mind: Raman Goyal","Bathinda’s first woman mayor, Raman Goyal of Congress, is scheduled to assume office on Friday.

Work to strengthen stormwater is underway and it will be ensured that work gets completed before the monsoon sets in. I will expedite works of shifting bus stand to a new location on the National Highway-7. Multi-level parking near fire Brigade Chowk will mitigate traffic nuisance to a large extent in the old locality of the city.

344,"Punjab, Himachal to provide free Covid vaccines in govt hospitals starting May 1","The Punjab and Himachal Pradesh governments on Thursday announced that they will provide free vaccinations to those aged above 18 years in all government hospitals and vaccination centres from May 1 onwards.

The decisions were taken at a high-level Covid review meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and a state Cabinet meeting in Himachal respectively, on Thursday evening.

Those getting vaccinated in private hospitals will have pay.

Capt’s Covid review meeting

The Punjab government has already been supplying vaccine free of cost to those above 45 in government health facilities. With the Centre extending the vaccination to those aged between 18 and 45 from May 1, Punjab will be providing the vaccine free those within this age group as well.

In view of limited supplies of the vaccine expected initially, the CM constituted an ‘expert group’ comprising eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, Dr Jacob John, Professor of Community Health at CMC in Vellore and Dr Rajesh Kumar former head, School of Public Health, PGIMER, in Chandigarh to suggest prioritisation in the 18-45 age group.

The CM tasked the expert group to chalk out a vaccination strategy and submit a detailed plan to the state government within a week.

Eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, emphasised the need to have a proper strategy to combat the current second wave of Covid, with geographical saturation in high caseload cities such as Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mohali, and Patiala besides prioritisation on the basis of medical need (serious co-morbidity) and on the basis of professional groups such as teachers.

The chief minister was informed that the state received 4 lakh more doses of Covishield vaccine from the Centre Thursday. As these were likely to last the state for only 3 or 4 more days as per the pace of the ongoing vaccination drive, he asked the health department to vigorously pursue with the Union government for ensuring requisite supply of more Covishield vaccine besides getting requisite stock of Covaxin doses as well.

Referring to the reports of black marketing of anti-viral drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the country, the chief minister said the experts have given clear protocols on the use of such medicines, which must be duly publicised and followed in right earnest.

Health Adviser Dr KK Talwar referred to the World Health Organisation (WHO) studies have shown that Remdesivir may not have any impact on the mortality due to Covid. Further, there were alternatives for Tocilizumab and such information is being regularly shared in the expert group of doctors.

Amarinder directed that the state should, however, continue to procure such drugs for patients who may benefit from their use, and provide the same to the government hospitals and also support the private hospitals, as was already being done.

Cabinet meeting in Himachal

“Although it will be a huge burden on the ex-chequer, the decision (to provide free vaccines) has been made keeping in mind general public welfare. The free vaccine will be provided in government health institutions,” said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj after a Cabinet meeting in Himachal Pradesh.

“The Cabinet decided to form mobile health teams at the block level to provide better treatment to Covid patients under home isolation. Each team will be given one vehicle exclusively to transfer the serious patients. Moreover, each medical college will now have a dedicated team headed by a senior doctor to monitor Covid cases. Each outsourced employee engaged in Covid duty will be given an incentive of Rs 200 per shift and Covid patients under home isolation will be provided with a nutrition kit,” he said.

Bhardwaj added that deputy commissioners have been permitted to impose Covid-related restrictions in their districts but with prior consultation with the state government.

No night curfew in HP, govt flags ‘fake news’

No night curfew has currently been imposed in Himachal Pradesh, the state government said on Thursday while reacting to fake news about night curfew on the social media.

“News which is being circulated in a certain section of social media regarding night curfew in the state is baseless and devoid of facts. As of now, there is no plan of any night restriction or curfew in the state. Only a few night restrictions have been imposed in Kangra district due to a sudden increase in Covid cases there,” said a government spokesperson, adding that in case there is a sharp surge in Covid cases, the concerned district administrations will make the final call regarding night restrictions in their districts after consulting with the state government.

The vigilant troopers responded with fire and the suspects managed to flee taking advantage of the darkness and standing wheat crop in the fields,” a senior BSF official said. “Though its seems to be an infiltration attempt, we are also looking at the possibility of an attempt to sneak in drugs or weapons into the Indian territory. A search operation in the area is still on,” he added. In July 2015, three gunmen dressed in army uniform opened fire on a bus and then attacked the Dinanagar police station in Gurdaspur district. The attack resulted in the death of three civilians and four policemen, including a superintendent of police (SP).The investigation after the attack had suggested that the three militants, who were killed during the siege at the police station, had come from Pakistan after crossing the Ravi."

The other accused are Ravez Singh Dhillon, Akashdeep Singh, Babaljit Singh, Iqbal and Ramneek Singh, all from the Khanna area of Ludhiana district, and NRIs Simran Sidhu (based in Italy) and Tanvir Singh Bedi (based in Australia). The agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR) under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on the basis of probe details shared by the Punjab Police’s special task force (STF) headed by additional director general of police (ADGP) Harpreet Singh Sidhu and other documents. The ED started its probe looking into the money trail in the case with links in Australia and Pakistan. “We will investigate as where the drug returns were invested and will start the attachment process of properties bought from the money. The role of Punjab Police officials and others whose name cropped during the STF probe is also under lens. We will proceed according to evidence,” said a senior ED official.

A total of 195 videos in Tamil, English, science, social science and mathematics have been created with the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) for the bridge courses. The videos for the bridge courses have been exclusively prepared keeping in mind the learning needs of the students. While they will not cover all lessons in their textbooks, the video lessons will focus on the fundamentals and core concepts.

Study material as well as workbooks have been distributed to the students of these classes through their schools. After May 10, Kalvi Tv will telecast videos that will help students complete exercises and assessments in their workbooks."

CHENNAI: Nervous guest workers from across Tamil Nadu continued to arrive at Chennai Central station, prompting Southern Railway to operate special trains and add additional coaches to trains to take them to their hometowns.

Railway officials said they would add 30 extra coaches to express trains bound for north and northeastern states in the next few days to ease the rush. âAugmentation of coaches on a need-basis and running special trains based on the waitlist build-up is a regular feature,â said an official and admitted that the number of guest workers arriving at the station was slowly rising.

Special trains will be operated based on demand to quell the panic among workers. Souther Railway assured them that trains would be operated from major stations in TN to their native state as a confidence-building measure. On Wednesday, guest workers rushed out of the Chennai Central-Mettupalayam Nilgiris Express to board a train to their home district. âWe feel safe in our village instead of staying in a small room with six to seven others,â said Sujit Yadav, a native of UPâs Gorakhpur.

Guest workers usually return to their native states for festivals and harvest season this time of the year. The second wave and fear of another lockdown, however, were major factors triggering the reverse migration.

366,Tamil Nadu’s 3.5L govt teachers push for work from home,"Representative image

CHENNAI: In a normal academic year, school teachers would start their five-week summer break from the last week of April. But, amid rising Covid-19 cases, more than 3.5 lakh government teachers continue to go to schools every day and thereâs no word on when they can stopping going to schools.

A majority of them travel using public transport, putting them at greater risk of infection.

Schools are closed for all students except Class XII, who are having their board practical exams.

The recent state government order, which imposed the night curfew, had stated that college and university professors must work from home but didnât mention anything about school teachers.

âTeachers have comorbidities too, they can get exposed to coronavirus as a majority of them use public transport. With cases surging and no in-person classes, the state government should just declare summer holidays to all schools,â said P Patric Raymond, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation.

Some postgraduate teachers are busy conducting practical exams for Class XII students, which will end on April 24. âBut many not engaged for the exams too have been coming to schools. They should be allowed to work from home,â said K P O Suresh, state president, The Tamil Nadu Post-Graduate Teachers Association.

Teachers from primary and middle schools are busy distributing bridge course material and workbooks to students from Classes I to IX. âThey can check whether students watch bridge courses on Kalvi TV from their houses. There is no need for them to come to schools,â a teacher from a government school said.

Meanwhile, teachers in private schools take online classes from their houses. âOur Class XII practical exams are over. We have asked teachers to take online classes from the safety of their houses,â the principal of a private school in the city said.

When contacted by TOI on the work from home demand, school education secretary Dheeraj Kumar did not respond.

367,AIADMK against move to open boxes of postal votes,"The AIADMK on Thursday urged Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo to ensure that ballot boxes containing postal votes are not opened before the scheduled date of counting — May 2. In a petition to the poll authorities, including the Chief Election Commissioner, the AIADMK contended that it had been receiving information that officials in some districts had suggested to candidates that the boxes be opened even on May 1 if there was a consensus among the contestants.

The premature opening of the boxes was bound to attract “multiple challenges” in the form of litigation after the declaration of results. Any deviation from established procedure was “liable to cause chaos,” the party stated. A delegation of party functionaries, including Minister D. Jayakumar, N. Balaganga and R.M. Babu Murugavel, met Mr Sahoo.

367,Higher turnout and victory margin not linked,"At Palacode and Karur, the difference between the winner and the loser in 2016 was very low

Contrary to the perception among sections of politicians and experts, there is no co-relation between a higher voter turnout and the margin of victory for the winner, going by the 2016 Assembly election results.

At Palacode in Dharmapuri district, where Tamil Nadu’s highest turnout of 88.57% was registered, Higher Education Minister K.P. Anbalagan won by 5,983 votes over his nearest DMK rival. The margin was around 3.2%. This time too, the constituency recorded the highest polling of 87.37%. Mr. Anbalagan is in the fray again.

Karur, another high-profile constituency from where Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar was elected five years ago, registered a turnout of 80.5%. But he won by only 441 votes. This time, the constituency reported a turnout of 83.57%. Mr. Vijayabhaskar is pitted against another prominent candidate V. Senthil Balaji of the DMK.

At the same time, there are instances of high-turnout constituencies coming out with huge margins. In Oddanchatram, where turnout over and above 80% is the norm since 2011, the winner, R. Sakkarapani of the DMK, secured a margin of 65,727 votes five years ago.

Tamil Culture-Language Minister K. Pandiarajan, who was elected from Avadi, an urban constituency, with a difference of 1,395 votes in 2016, however, feels the margin of victory is linked to the turnout. “I could sense it with my experience of having contested in four elections,” he says.

Former School Education Minister and DMK nominee in Tiruchuli Thangam Thennarasu concurs with him. Mr. Thennarasu, who first entered the Assembly in 1998, points out that there is a possibility of the victory margin being very high in high-turnout constituencies. However, the situation could change, depending upon the ability of a third contestant or party in affecting the fortunes of the first two candidates.

Academic G. Palanithurai says the difference is bound to be high when one candidate scores over the others in mobilising the electors.

There is a discordant view even among political leaders.

A senior functionary of the AIADMK says there have been instances of candidates scoring huge margins in constituencies where the turnout was lower than the State average. The candidates’ base in their constituencies is a crucial factor in shaping the margins regardless of the turnout, he says."
367,‘No evidence to back my charge on Sterlite protest’,"Tamil superstar Rajinikanth has told a commission of inquiry that he does not have any evidence to substantiate his charge that anti-social elements had indulged in violence during the protest demanding closure of the Sterlite copper smelter here on May 22, 2018.

Thirteen persons were killed in police firing during a march taken out to the Collectorate.

Submits affidavit

In an affidavit submitted through his lawyer to the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan Commission of Inquiry into the police firing, the actor said he did not have any documentary evidence to prove his claim.

After meeting families of the victims of police firing and violence, Mr. Rajinikanth had told journalists that the infiltration of anti-social elements had led to violence.

Arul Vadivel Sekar, lawyer for the commission, told journalists on Thursday that Mr. Rajinikanth, in response to the summons, had sought permission to respond to a questionnaire. On receiving the questions, he submitted his reply.

Clarifications

“In his reply, he stated that his address to the media after visiting the victims at the Thoothukudi Medical College and Hospital was an unscheduled one, and he had no documentary evidence to prove his assertion that the intrusion of anti-social elements into the rally had caused violence and arson,” he said.

The commission would summon the actor to get “a few more clarifications” based on his reply.

The commission had summoned Mr. Rajinikanth to share evidence. The actor did not turn up before the commission on a few occasions, contending that his appearance would cause hardship to the people. Later, he cited COVID-19 for his inability to depose.

Mr. Sekar said 48 persons deposed at the 27th sitting held between April 19 and 22. So far, 719 of the 1,052 people summoned had appeared before the commission. The policemen on security duty during the rally, the policemen injured in the violence and government officials, including the then Collector, would be summoned for the next sitting to be held between May 17 and 21, he said."
368,"Ensure that people wear masks, maintain distance: HC","Court issues directive to govt. on PIL plea filed in November

The Madras High Court on Thursday impressed upon the need for the State government and municipal corporations to strictly enforce the rule of wearing masks and maintaining physical distance in public places to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The court said the government and the civic bodies should also ensure that people do not congregate in large numbers in any place since the rate of infection was much more now than what it was previously.

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed in November last year.

Passing interim orders in the case, the judges said the fear expressed by the litigant last year had come true now with the State experiencing the second wave of COVID-19.

New regulations

In reply, State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayanan told the court that the government had come up with new regulations now by which the number of participants even in marriage ceremonies and funerals had been restricted.

Only on paper

Advocate Karthika Ashok, representing Chennai Corporation, said officials had begun to crack the whip on those who did not wear masks and failed to follow physical distancing norms.

However, petitioner’s counsel told the court that all rules and regulations of the government were only on paper and not put to practice.

Referring to the recent death of film actor Vivekh, he said thousands of fans paid respects to the actor but most of them were found to be not wearing masks. He said physical distancing too went for a toss during the congregation and no action was taken by officials.

Concurring with him, the Chief Justice said he too had watched such scenes on television as well as in newspapers. Lamenting that nobody bothered to enforce the COVID-19 protocol, he asked the SGP and counsel for Chennai Corporation to ensure that such incidents do not recur."

369,TNSCB demolishes church constructed on encroached land,"CHENNAI: Panic gripped MKB Nagar residents after nearly 50 people protested when officials of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board ( TNSCB ) demolished a church on Tuesday.

Sources said there were around 180 houses in the TNSCB tenement complex at MKB Nagar. Since the houses were in a dilapidated condition, they decided to construct a new building.

As part of this, Rs 45.31 crore was sanctioned for the construction.

In the first phase, the officials decided to clear the buildings that encroached on the premises and demolished the church.

Soon after the officials arrived, 50 people gathered on the premises raising slogans. They tried to stop the earthmover from demolishing the building when police chased them away.

âThe church had been functioning for two decades and there is no reason to demolish it as it did not cause any hindrance to anybody,â said Mary, a protestor.

Government officials said the demolition was not sudden and had been planned for more than a year and due notices were given.

They had been asking encroachers to vacate to which no one had paid any heed.

The officials cited land encroachment as the reason behind the demolishing and that the church was unauthorised.

CHENNAI: A 45-year-old man died by suicide after setting himself ablaze in public at Vinayagapuram near Kolathur. Police said he was upset over the sudden demise of his son.

The deceased, Velmurugan of Vinayagapuram, worked as a building demolition contractor. Police inquiring about him said Velmurugan had been visibly upset since his son died due to an ailment.

âVelmurugan didnât get any contract jobs to demolish buildings during the lockdown. As fresh curbs were introduced from April 20 in light of Covid-19 the second wave, loss of business added to his stress,â a police officer said.

On Tuesday, he walked to Perambur-Kolathur-Red Hills Road, stopped near a marriage hall and doused himself with petrol he brought along. He then set himself on fire.

Road users around put out the fire using water cans while a few others informed police and fire and rescue services personnel. Police sent Velmurugan to the Kilpauk Medical College ( KMC ) hospital to treat his burns.

The doctors there examined him and said he suffered 85% burns. He died in the hospital early on Wednesday. The Puzhal police have registered a case and further investigations are on.

369,"Vacant plot along Thazhambur lake a dumping ground, say residents","The lake is a freshwater source for the locality that heavily depends on groundwater for its needs

A vacant plot along the recently rejuvenated Thazhambur lake, off Rajiv Gandhi Salai, is being used as a dumping ground, residents of the area said.

Heaps of garbage dumped on the site along Karanai Road was often set on fire, residents said, adding that it posed a health hazard to them. Spread over 30.6 hectares, the Thazhambur lake is a freshwater source for the locality that heavily depends on groundwater for its needs.

The waterbody can now store up to 22 million cubic feet of water after the restoration efforts of Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, with funding from Hinduja Leyland Finance.

Kannan Sethuraman, a resident of Thazhambur, noted that the size of the garbage dump had been increasing for the past four years and hospital waste, too, was often dumped there. Thick smoke emanating from the fire engulfed the area and often caused irritation in the eyes and throat.

The Arihant Heirloom Flat Owners Association and the Adroit District apartment association had represented the issue to the local body and the Kancheepuram district administration. Residents complained that the waste was dumped by private vehicles and those belonging to the panchayat. This affected nearly 800 apartments and houses around the lake.

Anbu Vahini, a resident, said the lake was recently rejuvenated and was also now home to several species of birds. It was also major source of groundwater recharge. Frequent burning of garbage close to the lake may contaminate the freshwater body.

She recalled that the local body had promised to take up scientific disposal of waste through composting during the hearing of a case filed by Madipakkam residents at the National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, in 2017. However, the panchayat was yet to adopt a solid waste management policy.

Residents demanded that the local body shift the dumping yard to an alternate site.

Jayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee, Care Earth Trust, said the lake had been restored and fenced. Residents had planted saplings along the waterbody. Waste was being dumped on the outer periphery of the lake. Security personnel had been deployed to prevent the misuse of the waterbody, including the dumping of waste.

Sources in the Thazhambur village panchayat said the vacant plot was being used after approval. “We are unable to find an alternate site in the locality as it has become urbanised. We are planning to seek permission from Greater Chennai Corporation to convey waste from Thazhambur to its dumping site.”"

370,Tamil Nadu: Cheques to kin of firecracker blast victims bounce,"Representative image

VIRUDHUNAGAR: Compensation cheques offered by a firecracker unit owner to the families of 25 victims of a blast that happened in his unit at Achankulam near Sattur on February 12 have bounced. The Fireworks and Matches Workers Association affiliated to CITU has charged that the owners are not keeping sufficient funds in their accounts as a ploy to secure bail from courts in related cases.

As many as 27 employees working at Rajammal Fireworks were killed in the blast.

The owner of the firecracker unit had issued cheques of ?5 lakh each to the victimsâ family but only those given to two families were cleared. S Kalaidas, of Padanthal village near Sattur, said he lost his sister Panchavarnam , 55, in the accident. The fireworks unit owner had given him ?50,000 to perform the funeral rites and a cheque of ?5 lakh as compensation. However, when he went to the bank in March to encash the cheque, he was informed that there was not enough money in the account. He learned that only two of the cheques were cleared and the remaining had bounced.

Kalidas said he has received the ?3 lakh compensation from the state government, but is yet to receive the ?2 lakh announced by the Centre. He said family members of all the victims are daily wagers and would not be able to leave work and go to the bank every time. District collector R Kannan told TOI that he had asked police to file a cheque fraud case against the fireworks manufacturer.

The district secretary of Fireworks and Matches Workers Association M Mahalakshmi, said this was the third incident in which compensation cheques given by owners of cracker unit had bounced. She further said none of the families have received the Centreâs relief of ?2 lakh while 10 families are yet to receive the state governmentâs compensation too.

Following a representation, Virudhunagar collector said steps would be taken to provide the state governmentâs compensation to the remaining families once the election model code of conduct is lifted.

371,Coronavirus | Many in Tamil Nadu miss out on second dose,"In rural areas, even first dose is being administered only to a limited number

While the Central and State governments have announced the roll-out of universal COVID-19 vaccination for adults from May 1, many senior citizens and those aged above 45 are unable to get their second dose owing to vaccine shortage at many government and private hospitals.

In rural areas, even the first dose is being administered to only a limited number of people daily; in Chennai, a section of residents found it difficult to get the second dose.

Mathew Thomas, a resident of Old Mahabalipuram Road, went to the Injambakkam primary health centre for the second dose of Covaxin. “Covishield was available but the PHC had no stock of Covaxin. I have to wait for Covaxin since this is my second jab,” he said.

The staffers told him that Covaxin was expected in two days. He left his contact number. “I saw a list of phone numbers written down. Reality is different from the plan,” he said.

For a week, only this PHC had been providing Covaxin in the East Coast Road-Old Mahabalipuram Road belt, sources said.

A person who went to a private hospital on Nelson Manickam Road for his second dose had a bitter experience. He had taken his first dose on March 10. People were asked to wait in a temporary tent until the vaccine arrived. Officials then announced that only the second dose would be administered. “Once the vaccine arrived, it was a mad scramble,” he said.

Another person who wanted his parents to receive the second dose on Friday said when he called up the hospital, officials there told him that they had run out of stock and asked him to check again on Monday. His father had suffered three strokes. “If he were to contract the infection, he would not survive,” he said. Though his parents had paid ₹1,000 in advance for both doses, he decided to try another private hospital at Chetpet, which had also run out of stock. The government had recommended a wait period of eight weeks after the first dose. But he wanted his parents to have the second dose sooner in anticipation of chaos after May 1.

According to healthcare providers, the shortage is more pronounced in the private sector than at government hospitals. “If a hospital sought 20 doses, it was given just three. Shortage is high in the private sector and around 30%-50% in the government sector. It will take a month to settle down,” said T.N. Ravishankar, past president of the Indian Medical Association. “When the vaccine manufacture is augmented, the situation will ease.”

Senior doctors in the private sector said the stocks had been low for over 10 days. Centres that administered more doses were given more. Hospitals were advised to turn away new patients and reserve the doses for the second round. While Covaxin had not been supplied for more than a week, Covishield that arrived a few days ago was being sent to government hospitals and health centres, doctors said."
371,India’s leather exports decline 28.3% to $3.3 billion in 2020-21,"COVID-19 has hit key overseas markets, says association

India’s export of leather and leather products declined about 28.3% to $3.3 billion in 2020-21 from $4.6 billion in 2019-2020 owing to the COVID-19 impact on key markets of the European Union, the U.K. and the U.S., according to the Council for Leather Exports.

“Most of the sales in the overseas markets are happening through e-commerce mode and hence there is a vast change in the customer requirements as malls and shops are closed in our overseas markets and hence customers do not want to pile up inventories,” Shai Aqeel Ahmed Panaruna, chairman, Council for Leather Exports, said.

On account of the changed market scenario, customers were now demanding quicker delivery of products as well. However, there was a shortage of containers which was affecting the shipments, he pointed out.

Mr. Panaruna said major markets were opening up, but the industry was concerned about the impact of surging COVID-19 cases in India on exports.

The government had announced submission of application for incentives under the Merchandise Exports for India Scheme (MEIS) for 2019-2020 till September 30, 2021, as the industry was facing working capital problems, he said.

Online facility sought

The Council for Leather Exports had sought a facility for online applications under MEIS for the period April-December 2020.

It had asked for early notification of rates under the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RODTEP), which came into effect from January 1, replacing the MEIS and also extension of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS 2.0) to the leather and leather products industry. “These two support measures are crucial for our export revival and for the sustainability of our exports. We are also expecting a favourable Foreign Trade Policy for complete revival of exports as the existing policy has been extended further till September 2021,” Mr. Panaruna said.

He said India was the world’s second largest producer of footwear (both leather and non-leather). There was a positive demand for local supplies and hence more and more brands were now looking to manufacture in India for domestic sales, instead of importing footwear from other countries, he added."
371,Vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu brought down to 5%,"Steps are being taken to reduce it further to 3%; from May 1, it will be avoided totally, says Chief Secy.

COVID-19 vaccine wastage across Tamil Nadu was reduced to 5% between April 1 and April 20, and steps are being taken to cut it further to 3%, the State government said on Thursday.

In a statement after meetings with senior officials and Collectors, Chief Secretary Rajeev Ranjan said that with the Centre allowing vaccination of those aged above 18 from May 1, wastage would be avoided totally.

Reasons cited

As for the reasons for the wastage, he said 20 persons would be administered vaccine from one vial of Covaxin and 10 persons from one vial of Covishield. “In the beginning, when the general mood was to avoid vaccines and five to six persons showed up at vaccination centres in the evenings just before the drive was to end for the day, shots were administered with the high objective not to disappoint those who came for vaccination,” he said. Hence, doses that would have been given to four or five persons went waste. Moreover, a vial had to be used up within four hours. The national vaccination programme allows wastage of up to 10%. “Due to the above reasons, wastage was reported between January 16 and March 31,” the statement said.

A senior official told The Hindu: “During the meetings, the government instructed officials to focus on contact-tracing, intensify vaccination in hotspot districts and monitor health infrastructure...”

As for the allegation that the RT-PCR test kits were being imported at higher rates from Brazil, the government said they were being imported “at the lowest cost in the country” from South Korea and the United States.

At present, of the 54,417 beds available at COVID-19 hospitals, 32,942 are fitted with oxygen supply. Steps are being taken to increase the number of ventilators and high-flow nasal cannulas.

Oxygen storage has been increased from 395 metric tonnes last year to 888 metrics tonnes this year. “A total of 1,167 metric tonnes of oxygen storage is at government and private hospitals,” the statement said.

Stocks in reserve

Medicines such as Tocilizumab inj 400 mg, Remdesivir inj 100 mg and Enoxaparin inj 40 mg were being supplied to all taluk hospitals across the State, Mr. Ranjan said. “Tamil Nadu is the only State where Remdesivir is available at all government hospitals in all districts,” he said. Stocks required for 20 days are in reserve and orders have been placed for 2 lakh vials. “Based on need, this [Remdesivir] is being given to private hospitals too.”

In the first phase, ₹61 crore was sanctioned for opening COVID-19 Care Centres in all districts. A total of 5,43,518 violations of the Public Health Act, 1939, were reported and fine of ₹11.5 crore was imposed.

Adviser to the government and former Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam, Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy and senior officials were present."

They called upon the state and Union governments to act more prudently in ensuring supply of oxygen, vaccines and hospital beds for those who require it badly.In a statement, DMK president M K Stalin suggested that the states too get the vaccines at the price that the Centre is getting at Rs 150. The Centre can fund the states, he said. He wondered how PM Narendra Modi, who is hailed by some as the greatest administrator, has failed in his duty to handle the Covid crisis.âUntil now, the Centre has been maintaining that the country has sufficient stock of oxygen and even exported 9,300 tonnes abroad. Now there are reports that it has floated tenders to import 50,000 tonnes of oxygen from overseas suppliers. Moreover, it had diverted oxygen from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. While our brethren in the neighbouring states too need our support, the Centre should have at least checked with the chief secretary or the caretaker government about the stateâs own requirement,â Stalin said. Questioning Tamil Nadu for wasting around 12.5% of vaccine dosage, Stalin said the explanation given by the authorities is not satisfying.AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran condemned the Centre for diverting oxygen from Tamil Nadu and without even bothering to check with the state authorities. No beds in hospitals, no oxygen and no Remdesivir. When someone calls the PMO citing a crisis, the Prime Minister is not there,â MNM chief Kamal Haasan said. Kamal said there was a need for the Centre, the state and voluntary organizations to work as one in the fight against the pandemic."
373,Use foreign medical graduates to combat COVID-19: petition,"Petition appeals to State to post foreign medical graduates on duty in hospitals

The Service Doctors and Post-Graduates Association (SDPGA) has appealed to the State government to post medical graduates, who have studied abroad, on duty in government and private medical college hospitals.

The association, in a letter to Health Secretary J. Radhakrishnan, suggested that doctors who had cleared the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination be considered for postings as CRRIs (compulsory rotational residential interns). There are currently 600 such graduates awaiting CRRI internship postings in the State, it said.

In the past, such graduates were posted in district-level institutions approved by the Medical Council of India. These included hospitals in Cuddalore, Erode, Kancheepuram, the Neiveli Lignite Corporation general hospital and private medical colleges.

“In the present COVID scenario, with requirements for increased number of health workforce, it could be of immense help if they are posted in concerned government hospitals, medical colleges,” the letter, signed by association president P. Saminathan, said."

375,"As cases go up, should Tamil Nadu be testing more?","A comparison with other States shows possible need for increased testing

The number of people tested every day for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu has stayed around the 1.1 lakh mark in the last week, even as cases and the State’s test positivity rate (TPR) continue to rise steadily.

The daily TPR crossed 10% on Tuesday and touched 11.18% on Thursday. The last time it was above 10% was during the last week of July, when an average of 60,000 tests were being done and 6,500 cases reported daily.

The State had 120 labs then. Now, it has more than doubled the figure to 263, with a capacity to perform RT-PCR and other types of tests for COVID-19. This raises questions about whether Tamil Nadu can and should increase testing.

Chennai, in particular, has a daily TPR of over 20% now. Last July, when the city was reporting a high number of cases, it was testing around 11,000-12,000 people a day, while its TPR was at 10%. While the cases reported daily have more than doubled now, tests increased to an average 17,000 last week — only a 50% increase from last July.

A comparison of Tamil Nadu with other States also highlighted the possible need for increased testing. For instance, among the 15 States that have over 50,000 active cases, Tamil Nadu stands ninth in terms of tests per million population performed every day.

Officials in Tamil Nadu have often highlighted the State’s complete reliance on RT-PCR tests, calling it the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, unlike other States that have widely used rapid antigen detection tests too.

Delhi and Karnataka, among the few States to provide a break-up on the number of RT-PCR and other tests performed on a daily basis, however, indicate the possibility of better utilisation of lab capacities.

Delhi, with 81 RT-PCR testing labs, performed 60,022 tests on average every day. Karnataka, with 153 labs, performed 1.25 lakh tests. In comparison, Tamil Nadu, with 189 RT-PCR labs, performed just 1.05 lakh tests.

Prabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, National Institute of Epidemiology-ICMR, stressed the need for increasing testing based on a focused and data-driven approach to proactively identify hotspots and contain the spread. She said that while Chennai had been doing it to a considerable extent, mainly through its fever camps, a similar approach could be followed across the State. “This can be particularly helpful in rural areas where people may have difficulties in getting themselves tested sooner,” she said.

K. Kolandaisamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, said tests had fairly stabilised in the State, and a sharp increase should not be undertaken to artificially bring TPR down. He, however, stressed the need for an increase in focused and proactive testing in containment zones, testing of antenatal mothers and others visiting hospitals.

J. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, said the government was following a principle of testing at least 10 persons for every person testing positive. “The tests needed for effective tracing are being done. We are also steadily increasing testing on a daily basis,” he said."
375,Madras high court takes suo motu notice of transfer of oxygen from Tamil Nadu to other states,"Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday took suo motu notice of newspaper reports on shortage of Remdesivir and ventilators and diversion of oxygen to other states which are required for Covid-19 treatment in Tamil Nadu .

The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy also directed advocate general Vijay Narayan to get instructions on the measures taken by the state to handle the crises by noon.

âThere are news reports on supply of oxygen being diverted to other states. There are also reports about shortage of ventilators. We propose to take up these matters in the second half today ahead of any other business we have. We want to put you on notice before,â the bench said to the AG.

âWe donât want to add to the confusion, but we want to put you on notice before so that you can obtain instructions form the government and tell us what measures are being taken because within the state also without reference to anybody we have sufficient industries that can be required to manufacture oxygen on a daily basis,â the court added.

âThere are many industries that will do this. Oxygen is a basic thing the state is also well equipped to transport oxygen from one part to another. So, we must have all this in order,â the bench said.

âWe repeat that we donât want to add to the confusion, but we want to be satisfied that the state is on the top of this so that we donât reach the situation which is there in other states,â the judges said, directing the AG to report back by 2.15pm today.

375,"Resolve differences, HC tells Lyca, Shankar","Court directive follows plea over delay in completing Kamal-starrer Indian 2

The Madras High Court on Thursday suggested that Lyca Productions and film director Shankar sit across the table and resolve their differences in completing the Kamal Hassan-starrer Indian 2 rather than fight a legal battle. The court granted a week’s time for the production firm, which claimed to be losing crores of rupees due to the stalled project, and the film director, who had decided to take up other projects, to resolve their differences.

Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the suggestion when an appeal preferred by Lyca Productions was listed for hearing.

The appeal had been preferred against Justice P.T. Asha’s refusal to pass an ex-parte interim order restraining the director from directing any other movie without completing Indian 2.

The legal proceedings were initiated after Mr. Shankar decided to make a movie with Telugu actor Ram Charan.

The Bench, led by the Chief Justice, requested senior counsel P.S. Raman, representing the film director, to initiate the talks and asked advocate R. Prabhakaran, appearing on behalf of the production house, to ensure that its managing director based in London participates in the meeting, either in person or through video call. The outcome of the talks should be informed to the court by April 28, the Bench ordered.

According to Mr. Prabhakaran, Indian 2 was being made at a whopping budget of ₹236 crore. The remuneration of the director itself had been fixed at ₹36 crore, apart from a share in the net profits.

Payments continue

Stating that the production house had already paid an advance remuneration of ₹14.4 crore to the director, counsel claimed that the company was continuing to pay ₹1 crore to him every month though it was incurring huge loss due to the delay in making the movie.

On the other hand, Mr. Raman brought it to the notice of the court that Mr. Shankar was ready to shoot the movie from June to October despite having scheduled his daughter’s marriage during the same time.

However, the production company was yet to pay money to the art director so that the sets could be made ready. He said the director had sent a mail in this regard to the production house but it had not replied.

The court was also told that actor Vivekh was playing a crucial role in the movie but he died recently due to cardiac arrest."
376,Free vaccination camps from May 1,"T.N. to bear costs as announced earlier

The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday announced that it would organise free vaccination camps across the State from May 1 for target groups among those aged 18-45 to combat the spread of COVID-19. The State government would continue to bear the costs of such camps and most affected districts would be given priority, it said.

Construction workers, migrant labourers, those working in markets, retailers, workers of State Transport Corporations, government employees, school and college teachers and autorickshaw and taxi drivers would be given priority in the camps.

An official release said the State government would encourage major factories and companies, private organisations and hotels and restaurants to coordinate with private hospitals to administer vaccines to their employees.

The State government would also organise special camps to “boost herd immunity” among the general population as it aims to achieve immunity at least among 60% of its residents. “If this level is achieved, the spread will be contained naturally,” the release said.

The State government has also instructed district administrations to ensure the availability of medical infrastructure, including beds with oxygen supply, and required medicines.

“The spread of the infection can only be contained if contact tracing is effective. These efforts will be intensified,” the press release stated.

The number of RT-PCR tests will be increased based on the need, and the aim is to keep the spread in all districts under 10%, it said.

CM’s announcement

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had last year announced that vaccines would be administered to people for free, and on January 16, the government launched its inoculation drive.

The State has been administering both Covishield and Covaxin, as per the choice of the people, for free at its medical facilities.

While the State has adequate oxygen, “to encourage the production of oxygen additionally, steps are being taken to grant temporary licences to willing factories,” the release added."

In a Twitter post, he urged those eligible to take the vaccine immediately. Mr. Stalin also advised those with co-morbidities to consult with their doctors and take the vaccine.

He had taken his first dose on March 9 at Kauvery Hospital. “Let’s save ourselves and the people of the nation,” he said."
378,‘We’ve surplus oxygen and enough ventilators’,"No shortage of Remdesivir, says govt.

The Tamil Nadu government on Thursday asserted before the Madras High Court that it had sufficient hospital beds and vaccines to deal with COVID-19.

It also claimed to be producing a surplus amount of oxygen and in possession of adequate ventilators and Remdesivir to meet any exigency, including a sudden spurt in cases.

The submission was made before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy, who made a fervent appeal to the Centre to take into account that a large population of the country might not be able to afford the vaccines if they were sold by private companies for ₹400 a dose to the State governments and ₹600 to private hospitals.

Since the Centre had decided to permit inoculation of all citizens aged over 18 from May 1, the plight of the poor and the middle class, who are already in economic distress owing to the raging second wave of COVID-19, should be considered while the vaccine prices are fixed, the judges said. Additional Solicitor-General R. Sankaranarayanan agreed to convey the court’s concern to the Centre.

The observations were made at the hearing of an urgent suo motu public interest litigation petition taken up by the court on the basis of news reports that Remdesivir was being diverted from government hospitals to private ones and oxygen cylinders were being diverted from the State to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana without the government’s consent.

Making his submissions in response to the case, Advocate-General Vijay Narayan said the State had 31,000 vials of Remdesivir, and there was no shortage at all. He said the government was providing the drug to private hospitals, which did not have enough stock, at ₹783 per vial, though the maximum retail price of each vial was ₹4,800. Mr. Narayan said the State had a capacity to store 1,167 tonnes of oxygen and manufacture 400 tonnes a day. Additionally, 150 tonnes a day could be produced in Puducherry. However, the current usage in Tamil Nadu was only 250 tonnes a day; therefore, 65 tonnes of surplus oxygen was recently diverted to the neighbouring States, he said.

The court was told that 9,600 ventilators were available in government hospitals, and 5,887 of them had been earmarked for COVID-19 patients. The government also had many Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines and 2,440 high-flow nasal oxygen cannulas. Private hospitals had 6,000 ventilators, of which 3,000 had been earmarked for COVID-19 patients

When the Chief Justice wanted to know the number of active cases, the Advocate-General said 84,361 was the latest figure available with him and sought time to submit the number of beds and vaccine doses available. After recording his submissions and observing that special regulations must be put in place for the counting of votes on May 2, the judges directed the High Court Registry to list the case again for Monday for submission of the data."

380,Truck turns turtle at Maduravoyal,"Traffic disrupted for over an hour; nobody hurt in the incident

Traffic flow on the ramp leading to the Chennai bypass at Maduravoyal remained disrupted for over an hour on Thursday evening after a trailer truck carrying a container turned turtle.

Sources in the Maduravoyal police said the incident happened around 6.30 p.m. when the vehicle, proceeding from the Ambattur side, climbed onto the elevated bypass. Nobody was hurt in the incident.

On way to the port

Engineers of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said the movement of vehicles on the bypass was not affected due to the accident. The container was apparently carrying plastic goods and was proceeding to the Chennai port. When the driver was questioned, it was said the link between the pulling vehicle and the trailer was not fastened properly.

Incidents of container-carrying trailer trucks turning turtle are common on both the Chennai bypass and the four roads that form the Ennore-Manali Road Improvement Project in north Chennai."
381,"After delay, ECR widening soon","Work to widen 10.5 km urban stretch will commence within this financial year

After several years of delay, work to widen the 10.5 km urban stretch of the East Coast Road (ECR) from Thiruvanmiyur to Akkarai is likely to commence within this financial year.

“Wherever we could, we have widened the road into six lanes. With the land acquisition process nearing completion and payments being made to property owners, we hope to complete around 80% of the widening by the end of the current financial year,” said a source in the Highways Department.

The project was initially announced in 2005 and a token amount of ₹10 crore was sanctioned by the government.

Continuous delays in land acquisition and court cases ensured that the four-lane road remained at that width in most stretches. It will cost under ₹10 crore to widen and construct stormwater drains (SWD) and footpaths on both sides.

K. Suseela, a resident of Neelankarai, said the road had not been widened for a long time.

This had caused traffic movement to slow down considerably in these areas. “One cannot go beyond 40 km/hr at any point of time since there are pedestrians and local traffic. We were expecting the elevated road from Thiruvanmiyur to the RTO office to be extended till Akkarai,” she said.

Flood control

Meanwhile, the Department is presently constructing SWDs in Palavakkam for a length of 1.5 km to prevent flooding.

“Many drains leading from the western side of the ECR empty themselves onto the road, leading to flooding. We deploy motors to pump out the water since it disturbs traffic flow,” said an engineer associated with the project."

“People should wear face masks when they step out of their homes and maintain physical distance in public places. They should avoid crowds and avoid going out without no reason. If we follow all the guidelines, we can control the pandemic. The city can emerge out of it soon,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

“People should not avoid testing for the virus if they develop symptoms. Also, getting vaccinated is a social responsibility,” the Police Commissioner said in his address."

MADURAI: The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-corruption filed cases against five former and current employees of the Madurai Corporation and a private person for swindling Rs 88.88 lakh of the civic body for purchasing mosquito repellent from a non-existent company.

An FIR was filed by the department based on a complaint from A Kannan on April 15 this year. In the FIR, it was noted that the civic body had incurred a loss due to the actions of the officials.

DVAC filed cases against Dr V Satish Raghavan, 48, who was the chief health officer of the Madurai Corporation from January 12, 2017 to February 20, 2019, Dr K Parthiban, 33, who was an assistant city health officer from July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2018, N K Malinim, who was the superintendent of the central health department from July 10, 2017 and December 31, 2017 and P Gunasekaran, 53 who was an assistant in the department between December 20, 2017 to December 7, 2018, A Abdul Karim, 62, a retired clerk, and S P Ramamoorthy of Chennai.

CHENNAI: When Jayalakshmi Sundaresan tested Covid-positive, she was overwhelmed by the love she received from friends and family, particularly those who made an effort to send her nutritious, vegetarian food so she could enjoy a homecooked meal. She has now decided to provide this dose of love to others quarantining at home.

âWhen I tested positive, I immediately sent my mother away to a relativeâs as she has low immunity,â says Sundaresan. âThe first week I was asymptomatic but later I had every symptom and was too sick to cook. Luckily, friends and relatives sent me meals all through my quarantine.â

With the second wave sweeping across the city, many Good Samaritans have taken to providing free, nutritious meals to those quarantining at home.

Abinaya Karthik, 34, who runs an industrial catering unit in Villivakkam, launched last week her initiative, âMission Upkharâ, offering free food to underprivileged patients.

âThere are many people out there who cannot afford to have healthy meals, so I wanted to provide them with food that will help boost their immunity,â says Abhinaya, who is now providing free food to 20 patients. âMy kitchen is in Villivakkam so we can deliver food to people within a 5km radius. I am catering also to 50 other patients who want homely food and can pay for it.â

She usually provides idlis, idiyappams or millet dosa for breakfast, a south Indian thali, and a vegetable or fruit salad for lunch and chapattis or idiyappams for dinner. âWe also give sachets of carrot, turmeric or ginger malt along with the food as it boost immunity,â she says.

Sundaresan plans to start the free service from April 23. âAfter I put up a post on social media, a few friends who are down with Covid-19 have reached out,â says Jayalakshmi, whose mother, aunts and friends will be helping her with the initiative. âPeople can contact me on Instagram and I will Dunzo the food to them.â

Anna Nagar resident Vimala Davuluri, who runs the restaurant Agraharam, is also offering to do the same.Alexander Athisayanathan, who provided meals for the homeless throughout the national lockdown, says he will be doing the same now and also extend it to patients who are quarantining at home.

âLast April, I distributed survival kits containing vegetable biriyani, curd rice, bisi bele bath, a water bottle, one soap, one mask, and any fruit, either two bananas or two oranges,â he says. âFrom this weekend, I am restarting the initiative as I have a team of volunteers. Any patient who wants a homely meal can reach out to me. And we will ensure it is delivered to them free of charge.â

383,Fishermen protest against hatcheries being too close to high tide line,"The units let out effluents, they complain

Fishermen organisations on Wednesday urged the government not to permit shrimp hatcheries to set up structures too close to the shore.

Staging a protest at the office of the Fisheries Department at Nandanam, where the Coastal Aquaculture Authority (CAA) is also located, representatives of the Tamil Nadu Meenavar Iyakkangalin Orunginaippu Kuzhu alleged that the hatcheries that grew shrimp seeds meant for farms were setting up structures too close to the high tide line.

“These units have approvals only from the CAA and have no other regulating authority. They let out effluents,” they alleged. They said vast tracts of common lands meant for use by fishing villages were being usurped by these industries.

D. Ramraj, president, All India Shrimp Hatcheries Association, said the shrimp larvae were mostly fed algae and compound feed and not any chemicals.

“They are very sensitive live organisms and cannot be given any chemicals. The discharge from the hatcheries are monitored and are well within limits. Breeding fish, shrimp or any marine species requires sea water and sea front access and therefore a hatchery has been notified as a permitted activity under the CRZ regulations right from 1991 onwards,” he said.

Sources in the CAA said most shrimp hatcheries were located within 2 km of high tide line. All these hatcheries fell under its jurisdiction and it regulated all their activities, starting from construction to monitoring their operations.

Over 10 hatcheries that violated the provisions of the CAA Act, 2005, and its rules and regulations had been deregistered and closed by the CAA."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has abdicated his responsibility to the States after failing to control the spread of the coronavirus, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said.

“If something goes right, Mr. Modi takes all the credit but when anything goes wrong, he places the burden on others. Does Mr. Modi think that this is cooperative federalism?” he asked.

Slams PM, Amit Shah

Slamming the Prime Minister for announcing a ‘Vaccination Festival’ and then going on an ‘election campaign festival’ in West Bengal, he accused Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah of conducting large rallies and spreading COVID-19 there and not worrying about the tragedy unfolding across the country.

He also criticised Mr. Modi for announcing that States would have to purchase vaccines at ₹400 and private hospitals for ₹600 when the Centre procured the vaccines at ₹150 each.

“Mr. Modi wants everything to be ‘one nation one tax, one nation one entrance exam, one nation one election’ but is now asking everyone to procure vaccines at different rates. Nowhere in the world has any government allowed this sort of pricing to be fixed by a corporate during this pandemic when the focus is on saving lives,” he said.

He asked who had increased the price cap on the vaccines instead of ramping up the production. “The Modi government is hand in glove with vaccine manufacturers and the black market for vaccines. There can be no other bigger anti-people measure than this at the moment. Many countries, including the U.S., are vaccinating all citizens for free,” Mr. Alagiri pointed out."

Irked by this, residents complained that they are forced to take a detour of 3-4 km to reach the main road.Expressing anguish over the LMA denying access to them, a resident registered complaints on Twitter tagging defence minister Rajnath Singh, municipal administration minister KT Rama Rao and MAUD principal secretary Arvind Kumar.Another resident, on condition of anonymity, told TOI, âWhile the pandemic cases are rising, the LMAâs decision is meaningless. On-duty jawans are also denying the residents access to the entry gate.â TOIâs efforts to get a response from the defence PRO proved futile.Locals of Pension Lanes in Bowenpally staged a protest against the LMAâs decision to deny access to an educational institution, playground and a shrine in the area. Locals conveyed their problems to a team of officials, including president Cantonment Board Brigadier Abhijit Chandra and SCB chief executive officer B Ajith Reddy, who visited the area on April 21.Defence officials responded to a plea by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and locals and gave an assurance to resolve the issue of access to the three places within two months. Meanwhile, residents who traverse between the north-eastern parts of Secunderabad and Hyderabad, are worried the LMA may shut more public places in coming days."
408,Send patients to Gandhi only in extreme cases: Min,"Hyderabad: Health minister Eatala Rajender on Thursday said Gandhi Hospital was running short of ventilator beds as a result of many patients coming to the hospital at the last minute. Speaking to reporters, the minister said that despite government giving permission to 1,200 hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, many are directing critical cases to Gandhi Hospital.

Eatala said the directive to districts was to treat patients at their hospitals and refer them to Gandhi only if they are in need of extreme care. âCurrently, 600 patients are being treated in oxygen beds. Patients should come to the hospital when symptoms get severe,â he said.He added that some private hospitals were trying to exploit patients and that such hospitals will not be spared.

The minister dismissed reports claiming a shortage of testing kits and said the state has a capacity to conduct 30,000 RT-PCR tests daily. He said the Centre was insisting on increasing RT-PCR tests without providing the means to do so. He added that more beds will be made available at private medical colleges.

409,HC comes to rescue of ex-NSG commando,"Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Thursday directed the state government to immediately sanction financial assistance to a crippled NSG commando so that he can construct a house. The government assured in October 2018 that it would construct a house for the commando, Kanagala Sriramulu, free of cost after allotting a 300 square yard plot on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

A bench of Chief Justice Hima Kohli and Justice B Vijaysen Reddy on Thursday directed the finance secretary to either sanction the money or appear before the court.

Last month when the case was heard, the judges had asked the state government to inform the court whether any decision was taken.

Sriramulu defused three live bombs during a terror attack on Indian Air Force base at Pathankot in Punjab on January 2, 2016, and saved several lives but was rendered severely crippled when the fourth one exploded on him in the process.

When Radhive Reddy, counsel for the state, said the matter was pending with the finance secretary, the judges said it was summoning him to the court. The state counsel then pleaded with them not to summon the official. âThe district collector has recommended some financial assistance. The finance secretary is exploring ways to help,â he said. At this, the judges said: âLet him sanction the fund in the mean time. He need not come. But, he has to appear before the court if he fails to sanction the fund.â The case was posted to first week of June.

The PIL was taken up by the court four years ago after learning about the plight of Sriramulu through media reports. He was found in a crippled state in his Hyderabad residence and it was becoming difficult for his family to meet the huge medical expenses. The Centre in 2017 said its medical board would soon meet to declare him physically unfit to remain in service and would, thereafter, hand over terminal benefits to the commando.

Nirmal too has seen a surge in cases.As a result, the increased case load from districts is leading to more patients coming to hospitals in Hyderabad. This, apart from patients coming directly from other states. Health minister Eatala Rajender said that patients coming from other states and being admitted to hospitals in Hyderabad is resulting in a rush.With 66 micro containment zones, Nizamabad has the second-highest number of such zones after Hyderabad. While Kamareddy has only two micro containment zones, the district has a high number of infections. Jagtial has six micro containment zones. Municipal bodies in border areas have started imposing their own lockdowns. Experts said the number of infections, especially in areas going to civic polls, is likely to increase despite campaign restrictions."

411,CM gets best treatment and not everyone: Jeevan ReddyHe demands reimbursement of corona medical bills,"Congress MLC. T. Jeevan Reddy has demanded the government to include corona treatment in Arogyasri as promised by the Chief Minister. K. Chandrashekhar Rao and also reimburse to all the patients who have been treated at the private hospitals.

At a press conference here, he said Chief Minister may get best treatment at private hospitals but all people were not so lucky and KCR was least bothered about it. People of Telangana neither get Arogyasri or Central Government’s Ayushman Bharat scheme. CM is so indifferent that he has not even reviewed the situation when it was going out of hands.

He said divergent versions from the government was further confusing the already psychologically-battered people. Health Minister, Eatela Rajender and Director of Medical Health speak in opposite words on the scarcity of medicines and beds and also the severity of the disease. He demanded that the government should set up two 500-bed hospitals immediately and alleged that the government has utterly failed to infuse confidence among the people.

The Congress MLC also demanded the Chief Minister to take the initiative of postponing the local body elections due to the severity of the virus and elections at this time will only push people into further danger. He wondered why the State Election Commission (SEC) was not keen to defer the elections when all the political parties except the ruling party were demanding the postponement.

He said in poll-bound municipal corporations too all the hospitals were overburdened with patients and there was no availability of beds. Why is the SEC and the government so adamant in going ahead with the polls, he asked. He reminded that the SEC in AP postponed the local body elections due to the rising corona cases."
411,"Hosps can’t deny cashless Covid claims, rules IRDAI","Hyderabad: The insurance regulator on Thursday directed insurance companies to take âappropriate actionâ against network hospitals denying cashless facility to Covid-19 patients. The advisory came at a time when companies say they are seeing higher Covid-related claims because private hospitals are denying the cashless facility and are overusing antibiotics.

Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too tweeted about this on Thursday evening saying: âReports are being received of some hospitals denying cashless insurance. Spoken to chairman, IRDAI SC Khuntia to act immediately. In Marchâ20 Covid included as a part of comprehensive health insurance. Cashless available at networked or even temporary hospitals.â

She also said that as on April 20, nearly 9 lakh Covid-related claims have been settled by insurance companies for Rs 8,642 crore. âEven tele-consultations can be covered. IRDAI shall direct companies to prioritise authorisations and settlements of Covid cases,â her tweet read.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) circular reads: âInsurers shall ensure that where the policyholder is notified about availability of cashless facility at the empanelled network provider, the cashless facility at such network provider shall be made available to the policyholders in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy contract and as per the terms agreed in SLA.â

Companies have also been told to ensure smooth availability of cashless facility.

A major grouse of the insurers is that hospitals charge different rates for Covid treatment across the country. Bhabtosh Mishra, director underwriting, products & claims at Max Bupa Health Insurance, pointed out that during the first wave, the average length of a Covid patientâs stay in hospital was around 10 days. It dropped to seven days by the end of December 2020.

âThe average claims (in the first wave) used to be around Rs 1.3 lakh. However, in the second wave, while the average number of days of hospitalisation is still hovering around seven days, the claim size has increased to over Rs 1.4 lakh,â he added.

âFor instance, unlike last year, we are seeing use of high-end antibiotics, like injection Meropenem and Targocid, without providing much justification of its use. This has led to an increase in the overall size of claims,â he said.

An official of an insurance company, who did not wish to be identified, said fraud claims management has also become a major issue as they have begun to see instances of false positive reports and cases of false hospitalisations.

âIn times of Covid, it becomes very difficult to physically visit hospitals and verify cases where we have doubts,â the official said.

S Prakash, MD, Star Health and Allied Insurance said the lack of adherence to standardised treatment protocols is a major concern and this is not only burdening insurance players but patients as well.

The head of a general insurance player also pointed out that there is a lot of panic among people as a result of which many are occupying beds when they do not need to.

Another health insurance playerâs official pointed out that they have come across cases where customers, despite sharing their single occupancy rooms with other patients due to lack of beds, were being charged single occupancy room rent, resulting in higher claims.

Even Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, added that it is not only about high Covid claims. He said overall health insurance claims are rising because many who had postponed health procedures last year have started going for it.

In fact, most of the reputed private educational institutions have air-conditioners with spacious classrooms. From the safety and security point of view, most schools have compound walls too, he opined.Additionally, UFERWAS has appealed the state agriculture department authorities to set up mobile vegetable and fruits vehicles.âThough vegetables are being sold by the petty vendors through pushcarts, it is risky for the consumers. These vendors visit every by-lane and sell the vegetables, coming in close contact with consumers, which poses a serious threat to others,â Gopal Das, an RWA member at Madhura Nagar said.The civic body has to deploy more sanitation workers and take up sanitisation at every by-lane on a regular basis to avoid further spreading of virus, advised a senior citizen of Uttamnagar in Malkajgiri GHMC circle."

He was upset over the Centre allocating just 5% of the four lakh vials the state needed to fight the surging Covid-19 cases in the second wave.

He also said it was wrong of the Centre to take control of allocation instead of leaving it to the states to buy directly from manufacturers. Talking to reporters, he said the state government had ordered four lakh vials of remdesivir from Hyderabad-based manufactures, but the Centre sent a letter that vial allocation would be controlled by them henceforth.

âIt is unfortunate that after we negotiated with the manufacturers, the Centre sent a letter allocating us just 21,551 vials for the period between April 21 and 30,â he said. âDuring the same time, the Centre had allocated two lakh injections to Maharashtra, 1.62 lakh to Gujarat and 61,000 to Delhi .â

415,"Centre biased on oxygen, vials: Eatala","State ordered 4 lakh Remdesivir vials, got only 21,551 for 10 days, says Health Minister

Though Telangana has placed an order for over 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir, the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of the anti-viral drug for 10 days (April 21-30).

Health Minister Eatala Rajender, who set alarm bells ringing on crucial COVID-19 resources, lashed out at the Central government’s ‘discrimination’ in allotting vaccines and oxygen to the State.

‘Centre responsible’

Requesting procurement of oxygen from places near Telangana, he said that the Central government would be responsible for oxygen shortage in the State if they do not make changes in norms.

During a press conference in the city on Thursday, he pointed out the problems with procurement of oxygen from faraway places in other States, why Hyderabad should not be seen as a place where patients only from Telangana get admitted, and other issues. He also pointed out to partiality towards Gujarat, and neglect towards Telangana.

Remdesivir is manufactured by at least two companies in and around Hyderabad. Till Wednesday, the State was procuring it directly. Mr. Rajender said that the Central government had issued an order on April 21 stating that they would take control over Remdesivir injections, other vaccines and oxygen.

“This is so saddening,” he said. Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan was informed of the issue, but there was no response.

He said that while the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of Remdesivir, Gujarat was allotted 1.63 lakh vials, Maharashtra 2 lakh vials, 61,000 to Delhi, and 92,000 to Madhya Pradesh.

60-70% from other States

Mr. Rajender said that around 60-70% of patients admitted in hospitals in Hyderabad were from other States. Usually, patients from Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Maharashtra get admitted to hospitals in the city.

The Minister mentioned this to drive home the point that patients from various States get treated in the city, and meagre allocation of the antiviral drug or other resources would create a crisis.

“We cannot impose a condition to admit patients only from our State. As the entire nation is in crisis, it is our responsibility to treat patients from everywhere. They should not face any issues. We placed order for 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir. I will write a letter to Union Health Minister,” he said.

Currently, Telangana requires around 260-270 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, and the demand may go up to 350 metric tonnes per day, he said. Mr. Rajender said that oxygen was procured from other States, not from Telangana.

Around 20 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from Bellary, 30 more from Hospet, 20 from Chennai and 84 from Odisha.

“Getting oxygen from places as far as 1,300 km is difficult. Special tankers are needed for that. We asked Dr. Harsh Vardhan to allocate oxygen from nearby places like Visakhapatnam, Sriperumbudur, and Bellary. If the Central government does not change its stance, it will have to take responsibility if there is any shortage,” he said.

Vaccine crunch

Shortage of COVID vaccines too, was pointed out at the presser. The Health Minister said that had vaccine production been increased, we would not have seen the shortage. He said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had asked for increase in production.

“Our suggestions were not considered,” he said, calling out varying prices of vaccines for Central and State governments."
415,DRDO product an oxygen source for COVID patients,"This automatic system delivers supplement oxygen based on the SpO2 levels

Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has unveiled a new product that is useful not only for Army soldiers fighting in the extreme high altitude areas, but to all those grappling with COVID crisis.

The Defence Bio-Engineering and Electro Medical Laboratory (DEBEL), Bengaluru, has developed SpO2 (Blood Oxygen Saturation) supplemental oxygen delivery system for soldiers at extreme high altitudes. This automatic system delivers supplement oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking in to a state of ‘hypoxia’, which is fatal in most cases.

Hypoxia is a state in which the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues is inadequate to fulfil all the energy requirements of the body. This is exactly the situation that a COVID patient may face leading to the current crisis, informed an official release.

The electronic hardware of the system is designed for functioning at extreme altitudes featuring low barometric pressures, low temperatures and humidity. The software safety checks incorporated into the system are critical in ensuring the functional reliability of the system in field conditions.

The system reads SpO2 levels of the subject from a wrist-worn pulse oximeter module through wireless interface and controls a proportional solenoid valve to regulate the oxygen supply. The oxygen is delivered from a lightweight portable cylinder through nasal prongs.

The system is available in various sizes from 1 litre and 1kg weight with 150 litres of oxygen supply to 10 litres and 10 kg weight with 1,500 litres of oxygen supply, which can sustain for 750 minutes with a continuous flow of two litres per minute. Since the system is indigenously developed for operation in field conditions, it is robust, cheap and already in bulk production.

The system can be used in the household for moderate COVID patients requiring oxygen flow therapy with flow controlled at 2/5/7/10 litres per minute. The automatic usage has huge advantage in the household, as the oximeter would give an alarm for lower SpO2 value. It will automatically increase/decrease the O2 flow based on SpO2 setting, which can be auto adjusted at 2,5,7,10 litres per minute flow rate.

The simple-to-use facility greatly reduces the work load and exposure time of doctors and paramedics to monitor the SpO2 levels of patients. A moderate COVID patient requires long time moderate O2 supply 10litre/150bar–10kg–1,500 litres, which can sustain up to 750 minutes, the release added."
416,"ICU Beds At Gandhi Occupied, O2 Beds Filling Fast","Hyderabad: With over 35,000 new cases recorded in Telangana between April 15 and 22 and a rising death toll, authorities at Gandhi hospital claimed they had run out of room in ICU and the oxygen beds are also filling up fast. The live bed availability tracking link, launched by the Telangana health department on Wednesday, shows all 619 ICU beds with ventilators in Gandhi Hospital as occupied while officials said 400 vacant oxygen beds are âfilling up fastâ.âAll 619 ICU beds with ventilators are occupied at present. With patients pouring in, vacant oxygen beds are also filling,â said Gandhi hospital superintendent Dr M Raja Rao. Doctors said critical patients, as a result, cannot be shifted to ICUs as they are already at maximum capacity. âThere are patients who recover, and we are shifting them to oxygen beds. ICU beds become vacant when there are some deaths or when patients move to private hospitals. This is how we are adjusting at present,â Dr Rao added.While general beds are still available, officials said people usually donât get admitted to general wards and prefer oxygen beds out of anxiety. Doctors said they were finding it difficult to admit patients with ventilator requirement and non-invasive ventilation since Wednesday evening. Some doctors working in the Covid-19 ward claimed that the mortuary at the hospital is also running out of space.âIt is true that the mortuary has been running out of space for the past few days. It is also taking a lot of time to shift the bodies from the hospital when a patient dies, especially when the attendants are not available,â a doctor told TOI, on condition of anonymity. âThe number of positive cases due to the virulent strain is also way more than what it was last year,â she added.However, the hospital superintendent denied claims of the hospital mortuary running out of space. âIt is not true that the hospital mortuary has no space. This is only creating unnecessary panic among patients and their attendants,â the superintendent said."
417,Procuring oxygen from faraway places a challenge,"Multiple issues in transportation

Procuring oxygen from places thousands of kilometres away from Telangana is fraught with risks that could hamper the supply, senior officials of the Health department said.

They added that there could be multiple problems while procuring oxygen from Bhilai, Madhya Pradesh, which is 1,300 km in a two-way journey. “There could be problems in transportation if a lockdown is announced, or some other unforeseen issue,” the senior officials said.

Besides, insufficient number of tankers to procure it is another problem, but that is being resolved. They said that around 305 metric tonnes of oxygen were being procured currently. But considering the severity of the COVID situation, around 400 metric tonnes of oxygen would be required in the State. This was communicated to the Union Ministry of Health, a few weeks ago.

The State is supposed to get 360 metric tonnes of oxygen, which includes 125 from here and 235 from other States. But only around 180 to 190 metric tonnes is being procured from outside sources.

“Procuring oxygen from far away places has become a challenge. It takes three days to get oxygen from Bhilai, and we don’t have that kind of time in the peak of pandemic,” sources in the Health department said.

Telangana is currently allowed to get oxygen from Bhilai, Bellary (Karnataka), and a place in Odisha. “Bellary is nearest to us and we are allowed to get only 20 metric tonnes from there. But Maharashtra and Karnataka are getting a major share from there. It would be of great help if we get 50% of the requirement from a nearest source like Bellary,” sources said.

Another source said that all means were being explored to get additional tankers. “Nitrogen tankers too, might be converted into oxygen tankers. Many other ways are being explored currently. The issue with tankers would be addressed gradually in three to four days,” sources said.

Sources and Health Minister Eatala Rajender stressed that there was no shortage of oxygen, and Remdesivir, at government hospitals.

While there were only four Liquid Oxygen Tanks (LOT) in government hospitals a year ago, it increased to 22. The LOTs convert liquid oxygen into medical oxygen. Of the 22, five are self-generating LOTs. The one at Gandhi Hospital is expected to be ready in three to four days.

Regarding scarcity of oxygen at private hospitals, officials said that private hospitals rely on bulk oxygen cylinders. Corporate hospitals too, were suggested to build LOT. But only three to four have it."

418,‘COVID deaths due to late detection’,"Ramp up testing to curb crisis situations, says senior official

Senior Central government officer Krishnamoorthy (name changed) has been pretty active throughout the pandemic touring the national capital and various cities and villages of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh but has been infected in this current nationwide second wave.

“I always took utmost precautions and was never without a mask in public but despite my best efforts, I got the virus. My symptoms are mild and am in home quarantine but my complaint is about inadequate testing facilities and the long time it takes to get the results, which I feel is causing more hospitalisations,” he says.

The senior official, who also held key posts in the twin cities, wanted to get himself tested in a private laboratory after he realised the mild fever was refusing to go. “I went to a diagnostic centre where I was informed that while the test could be done soon, the results can be expected in 72 hours only,” he explains.

His question is — What should the probable COVID positive patient do in the meanwhile? “Isn’t there a danger of the virus spreading further in the body during this time with delayed medical assistance because of the late test result information?,” he wonders. The officer managed to take the RT-PCR test and obtain the result in less than 24 hours making use of contacts in a private hospital, following which he began the treatment protocols immediately through online consultation of a private doctor.

“Deaths are happening not because of COVID infection but due to late detection of the disease and treatment. If we can ramp up the RT-PCR testing facilities, ensure results in shortest possible time and begin medication as per doctors’ advice, online or mobile too, we can not only save lives but prevent the rush to hospitals in critical stages. If private labs have managed to enhance their capabilities in the last one year, what prevents the government to scale them up?,” he asks.

The official is of the opinion that more people are voluntarily coming forward for testing this year. So, the health department on its own or on a public-private partnership should open more testing centres and provide quicker results to cut the serpentine queues in government healthcare facilities.

419,Number of people in Andhra availing free Covid treatment under state scheme crosses 1 lakh,"The number of people who received free Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals in Andhra Pradesh under Arogyasri scheme crossed one lakh Thursday. The state was the first to include Covid-19 treatment in the list of illnesses covered under the state’s flagship healthcare scheme just as the pandemic started last year.

“These people were able to receive the best Covid-19 treatment for free at private hospitals under Arogyasri. In most cases the hospital bills paid by the government were more than the annual income of the affected person and his or her family,” said Health Minister A K Krishna Srinivas. Till Thursday, 1,00,033 Covid-19 patients had received free treatment in various private hospitals across the state, under this scheme. The government has spent over Rs 309 crores to pay off the bills pertaining to these individuals. Under Arogyasri, economically and socially backward families receive free health care at listed hospitals, if the medical expense exceeds Rs 1,000.

The state government is providing free treatment at all government hospitals, and the private hospitals taken over by the government due to the pandemic, irrespective of whether or not the individual is eligible under Arogyasri. However, exclusively under the Arogyasri scheme, so far, 1,00,033 Covid-19 affected persons who chose to go to a private hospital not taken over by the government, have been treated. The scheme permitted some critically ill persons to receive treatment even at expensive hospitals such as Apollo Hospitals. In Nellore District, Manda Ramaiah (49) got admitted to Apollo Speciality Hospitals and his medical expenses of Rs 5,87,534 were paid by the state government through Arogyasri. Sheik Nazeer’s bills of Rs 4,68,312 were also approved under the scheme. One of the main criteria to be eligible for enrolment in Arogyasri is that the family’s income should be less than Rs 5 lakh per annum. Officials said that the huge hospital bills of Covid-19 patients would have brought financial ruin to such families as they would have had to spend an year’s income on treatment if they were not eligible for free treatment. The state which brought down the number of positive cases to less than 50 in the second week of February is witnessing a huge resurgence in Covid-19 positive cases. On Thursday, the state reported 10,759 cases and 29 Covid-related deaths. The total number of cases in the state so far is 9,97,462.

Alarmed at the drastic increase, a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by the health minister discussed key issues in containing the virus, steps to be taken to bring down the number of cases, oxygen supply, testing, vaccination and shall present the recommendations to Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The minister said that certain measures were taken to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen or medicines in hospitals across the state, adding that the oxygen supply is in-line with the requirement level. Currently, the state needs 360 metric tons of oxygen and there is no problem for government hospitals, he said, adding that the Centre will provide assistance to set up a new oxygen plant in the state. He said that the government has been trying to complete the vaccination programme faster. So far, over 49 lakh people have been vaccinated in Andhra Pradesh. The minister also warned that strict action would be taken against private hospitals if they charge more than the prescribed prices and asked them to act humanely during the pandemic."
420,Bodies keep coming to cremation grounds,"Workers at cremation grounds clearing open space to carry out funeral rites

At 06:10 p.m. on Thursday, 12 bodies were in the process of being cremated at the COVID-designated ESI Cremation Grounds in Hyderabad.

“12 bodies are being cremated in my shift. I cannot reveal information about how many bodies were burnt throughout the day as I am not authorised to speak,” said a staffer who keeps track of paperwork at the cremation ground.

The number of bodies flowing in for cremations is such that workers at the cremation ground are clearing open space to carry out the funeral rites. The workers broke from the tradition of conducting funerals on the platforms which are numbered. The cremation ground has two locations where there are raised platforms where funerals are carried out. Three funerals were being carried out in the open ground behind the trees and shrubs.

“There is a constant stream of ambulances and red funeral vans. Earlier, there used to be two or three funerals in a day. Now, I have stopped counting the number of bodies that are coming here,” said a juice vendor at the entrance of the funeral ground.

According to Health bulletin, 23 persons lost their lives to COVID on April 21 across the State and 5,567 tested positive.

There are three designated cremation grounds for Hindus at Amberpet, Bansilalpet and the ESI Cremation Ground.

An official manning the Telangana Waqf Board Helpline for burials refused to share details about the burials, saying he was not authorised to give out the information."

Gorakhpur MLA Radha Mohan Das Agrawal made the remarks after SII on Wednesday announced a price of Rs 600 per dose for Covishield supplies to private hospitals and Rs 400 per dose to state governments.

“@adarpoonawalla you are worse than a dacoit. @PMOIndia @AmitShah @blsanthosh @drharshvardhan should acquire your factory under epidemic act,” the MLA, who is also a doctor, said in a tweet in Hindi on Wednesday.

In a series of tweets, Agrawal also referred to the Swaminathan Commission’s formula for agriculture costs and prices.

434,"Ghaziabad runs out of ICU beds, records over 1,000 Covid-19 cases","Ghaziabad’s intensive care beds are almost full while the overall occupancy of Covid-19 beds was around 80%, according to official data released on Thursday.The district has 38 Covid hospitals, four of which are public. It has 2,909 beds, of which 2,326 are occupied. Only 38 of the 563 beds remained vacant on Thursday night.“That vacancy is mainly because there is no oxygen for those beds,” said an officer from the health department who did not wish to be named. “It is not like as if there are no people who do not need an ICU bed. They are forced to look for beds in other districts due to the oxygen crisis.” The state control room records indicate that the district on Thursday witnessed its highest single-day spike of 1023 cases and eight deaths. The experts said that with rising number of daily cases, there is urgent need for more beds, but regularisation of oxygen supply is a major roadblock in increase of beds. “The conditions on the ground is a major concern. During present times, we must make optimum use of resources. Beds cannot be increased if regular oxygen supply is not ensured and as a result patients will keep roaming around in search of beds. There are hospitals which cannot use ICU beds because of lack of oxygen supply. So, people occupying beds without any major symptoms should leave it for others,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “Administration should gear up and rope in charitable institutions or NGOs for more beds. The cases are expected to rise further, and we expect that they will reach peak by start of mid of May,” he added. “The trend is headed towards a peak which is higher than the one witnessed last year and some studies indicate that peak will be reach in May. So, we have to wait and watch. Roping in more beds will mean that oxygen supply is to be regularised and it is expected that it is expected to take couple of days as per developments taking place. All precautions are must in present times,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR). District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and detailed query raised to him about the issue of occupancy, new beds and lack of oxygen supply. Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) also did not take calls for a response. “The chief minister held a video conferencing on Thursday evening and directed officials that beds of L2 and L3 category need to be increased besides every hospital must display the availability at their premises. An order will be issued soon. He has also directed that RT-PCR testing also need to be increased,” said an officer from health department who wished not to be named.The sample positivity rate, number of positive samples per 100 tests, in the district in April till date was 5.71% on Thursday. The district suffered eight deaths due to Covid-19, taking its total death count to 125.As per state control room records, it took two days each for the total case count to jump from 29000 to 30000, 30000 to 31000 and 31000 to 32000. On Thursday, the district reached an overall tally of 33000 cases in a single day which is fastest achieved since March last year."

436,"Supply poor, private hospitals still face oxygen shortage in Ghaziabad and Noida"," Many private hospitals in Ghaziabad and Noida continued to face shortage of oxygen on Thursday as supplies could not keep with demand in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the national capital region.Officials of several hospitals in both the cities said that they are trying to arrange for oxygen on hourly basis even as family members of the patients were running pillar to post to procure oxygen cylinders. In Ghaziabad, officials familiar with the development said that the city currently requires 59 tonnes of oxygen daily, but supply is only about 30-35 tonnes per day. Shailesh Kumar, father of an 18-year-old girl, was in tears outside Avantika Hospital in Indirapuram and desperately seeking any arrangement for oxygen. “The hospital told us that there is no oxygen supply, and we should try elsewhere. How will she get the treatment now? She was admitted here since April 17,” he said. Many hospitals in the city face similar situation. “We have never faced such conditions with oxygen left for few hours and we are trying to arrange each and every cylinder we can. We have asked patients to make arrangements elsewhere. We have 35 patients and one of them left while others are trying to arrange oxygen on their own,” said Dr Yuvraj Sharma, managing director of Avantika Hospital. “At present, we are depending on and arranging for hourly supplies. The district administration is also trying to arrange oxygen for us. Many hospitals face similar issues,” Sharma said, adding that a minimum of 30 cylinders are required each day for Covid treatment. Nearby Shanti Gopal Hospital in Ahimsa Khand II also faced similar issues. “We have intimated patients about the issue of oxygen and have discharged patients who didn’t require emergency services. There are 25 Covid beds, but we have oxygen supply only for six hours. The administration got arranged 15 cylinders and we also arranged similar numbers. So, we will be able to manage till Friday afternoon. Only nine of 22 patients are left now,” said Dr Sanjay Garg, one of the directors at Shanti Gopal Hospital. “Even empty cylinders are not available at present so that we can get them refilled on our own,” Dr Garg added. Despite repeated attempts, Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls and text messages. Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city) and nodal officer for oxygen supplies, also did not respond to calls. However, officials of the district industries department said that 150 empty cylinders of seven cubic metres each were sent to Muzaffarnagar for refilling and once they reach Ghaziabad, they will be supplied to hospitals as per requirement. “We also have 60 empty cylinders of 60 cubic metres each and one empty tank with 20 tonne capacity. These can be refilled and can also be put to use for supply to hospitals,” said Virendra Kumar, general manager of district industries department.In Noida, the managements of Kailash Hospital in Sector 27 and Prakash Hospital in Sector 33 announced that it was difficult to function without adequate supply. Prakash Hospital said that its Noida facility has 55 Covid-19 patients and Greater Noida hospital has 85 positive patients. “For the last few days, the two hospitals have been facing serious difficulties in getting adequate and regular supply of oxygen. Our supplier is situated in Faridabad. On Thursday, the supplier said they could not give us oxygen as they have to supply the gas to Haryana hospitals,” said Ayush Chauhan, executive director, Prakash Hospital. In the afternoon, Prakash Hospital’s Noida facility had two and a half hours of oxygen supply, and Greater Noida facility hospital had three hours of oxygen supply, Chauhan said, adding that they were working on sourcing oxygen from other vendors. “We have shifted around 12 patients from Noida hospital and five patients from Greater Noida hospital to other hospitals,” said Chauhan. While the present requirement of oxygen in Gautam Budh Nagar is 60 metric tonnes (MT) a day, the supply is about 10 MT. Dr Shweta, in-charge of oxygen/medicine availability, GB Nagar, said Prakash Hospital had faced oxygen shortage since morning. “We provided them 80 oxygen cylinders and resumed supply. They shifted some patients to other hospitals for safety,” she said. Kailash Hospital at one point had only four to five hours of oxygen. “We’ve four hospitals in GB Nagar. All of them are suffering from the lack of oxygen. We have 450 patients and we’ve stopped new admissions due to the shortage.

All hospitals said that oxygen supply is running out,” said Nitin Ashu, a resident of Pratap Vihar in Ghaziabad. Under the present circumstances, families have arranged for oxygen cylinders on their own. “For the past four days my mother is not able to move out of bed.

The incident occurred in the afternoon at Dr. Zakir Husain Hospital in the Dwarka area of the city.

“The country is witnessing deficiency pertaining to the medical equipment along with failed distribution policy leading to greater consequences and on the other hand, negligent action of the hospital authorities leading to leakage of oxygen and death of COVID-19 patients.

“Such a situation has led to the violation of fundamental rights of the citizens of this country prima facie the right to health care, right to life enshrined under Article 21,” the plea said.

The petition has also sought registration of an FIR in the matter under Sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 304A (causing death by negligence)."
441,"Google Meet to get refreshed UI, video background replacement feature, and more","Google Meet (Web) is all set to get a redesigned UI in May. The company has announced in a blog post that a host of new features will also be added to the Web version. Google will also be rolling out the new background for video calls for its Web and mobile versions. Google Meet on the web will soon be able to detect when a user appears underexposed and enhance the brightness to improve their visibility.

The low-light mode feature is already available for the mobile version. The Light adjustment feature will be released to Meet in the coming weeks. There will also be an AI-based feature, which Google says will help others see you more clearly by zooming in and positioning you squarely in front of your camera. The feature is called Autozoom. However, this will only be available for Google Workspace (paid) subscribers in the coming months.

Users will also witness a new Data Saver feature, which will be rolled out this month. This feature limits data usage on mobile networks to allow you and the person you are calling to save on data costs. This feature could help save some data during video calls.

Last month, the search added a background replace feature for both Android and iOS devices. Now, Google is all set to add the ability to replace the background with a video, which sounds cool. The feature will be made available in the coming weeks.

“Video background replacement can help you maintain privacy for what’s behind you while also making your video calls more fun. There will initially be three options to choose from: a classroom, a party and a forest, with more on the way soon,” the company said.

Apart from these, Google Meet will also offer an option to resize, reposition or hide your own video feed. “When doing so, you can use the freed-up space to see even more people on the call,” Google said."

442,"Apple Plans Notifications, iPad Home Screen Upgrades for iOS 15","Apple Inc. is readying a major revamp of its iOS 15 mobile software that will include an upgrade to how users handle notifications, a redesigned iPad Home Screen, an updated Lock Screen, and additional privacy protections for its flagship devices, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

The in-development changes are planned to be included in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, forthcoming major software updates for the iPhone and iPad. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant will announce the software updates, codenamed Sky, at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference beginning June 7, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.

Apple rolls out major software updates for all of its key devices annually as a way to keep people glued to its ecosystem, sell more devices and encourage developers to create new apps. Apple typically releases the upgrades around September, near the launch of new iPhones. Given that WWDC is several weeks away, the company could still choose to alter features or delay them to a later update. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.

The company is planning a new feature that will allow users to set different notification preferences, such as if the phone makes a sound or not, depending on their current status. The enhancement will come in the form of a new menu that lets users select if they are driving, working, sleeping or custom categories of their choosing. The menu will be shown on the updated Lock Screen and in Control Center, the iPhone and iPad’s menu for quickly accessing settings.

There will also be an option to set automatic replies to messages depending on their status. That will be an improvement over the current auto-reply feature, which is only currently available while driving. Apple has added some unique notifications features such as Do Not Disturb and Sleep Mode, but this will mark the first time the company offers a systemwide feature for changing notifications depending on a user’s status.

The company is also working on upgrades to iMessage with the eventual goal of acting as more of a social network and better competing with Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp. Those changes are still early in development and could come later, the people said.

The iPad line, which gained new iPad Pro models earlier this week, will also see software changes. The company is planning the most significant update to the device’s Home Screen since first launching the product in 2010. Following a similar feature for the iPhone introduced last year, Apple plans to let users place widgets — miniature apps that can display the weather, upcoming appointments, stock tickers and other data — anywhere on the Home Screen. Users will also be able to replace the entire app grid with only widgets.

More privacy protections are coming, too. One new feature in the works is a new menu that will show users which apps are silently collecting data about them. While Apple has increased the privacy of its devices in recent years, thousands of apps have been identified that use special trackers that can collect and share data such as phone numbers and location. The new feature is designed to cut down on that.

Apple is also planning a more minor update to macOS after its redesign last year, and updates to Apple Watch and Apple TV software."

Microsoft Teams users will soon be receiving a new update on macOS that follows the last late-March update. The new update now brings support for users to share their system audio with other users. The company also confirmed that a future update will enable native notifications in the macOS version of the Teams.

A report on Windows Latest has shared that the latest Microsoft Teams version on the Mac systems allows sounds to be shared during a Teams meeting when a user is sharing their screen. The feature, that allows a more immersive take on the screen sharing tool, is something Mac users had been waiting for for a long time.

Windows users have had the Microsoft Teams feature for a long time and users are able to share their screen along with the system audio. This even includes audio from any media files that a user plays.

You can still choose to not share system sounds

While the feature is now available, users will still have the choice to share their screen without the sound. If they wish to only share the screen like before and not any system sounds, users can simply choose to share their screens without sound.

Support for native system notifications on the way

Microsoft also recently confirmed that macOS users will also get native system notifications with Microsoft Teams in a future update. Native notification support began rolling out to Windows 10 users this month and the feature is expected to arrive soon on macOS soon as well.

Microsoft Teams on macOS currently uses its own notification system. This system is not fully integrated with Apple’s own operating system. With native notifications, alerts from Microsoft Teams will show up in the macOS notification center alongside other messages.

There is no officially confirmed date for this update as of now. However, Microsoft has said it could come in April. Support for the new M1 chips is also unclear at this point."

OnePlus launched a number of products during its OnePlus 9 series launch event. Apart from the three OnePlus 9 series smartphones and the brand’s first smartwatch, OnePlus also revealed a pair of gaming triggers towards the end of the event. However, OnePlus didn’t mention a timeline stating their availability.

However, the OnePlus Triggers have now been made available in India and can be purchased from the OnePlus store for Rs 1,099. The triggers were made official with a tweet from CEO Pete Lau. Check it out below.

We designed the OnePlus gaming triggers to be solid, responsive, pleasingly “clicky,” and, yes, beautiful. We also made sure they work with many other phones—because the best product design is one that leaves you free to make your own choices. pic.twitter.com/hJNa4Dsa5s — Pete Lau (@PeteLau) April 21, 2021

OnePlus Triggers: What you need to know

The OnePlus Triggers feature a matte black design with a large curved button on the top portion that users can click to trigger any key in games. The clip-like design of the triggers, similar to a number of third-party accessories, works by clipping on the vertical edge of a smartphone.

The OnePlus Triggers can be attached to any smartphone by OnePlus or other brands as long as the phone in question is lesser than 11.5mm in thickness. The touch controls would help users get more immersive feedback in games compared to on-screen touch controls.

The triggers which are designed to mimic the functionality of ‘shoulder buttons’ on phones like the Asus ROG phone series, also allow gamers to see more of the screen while playing since they do not cover the display with their fingers.

Note that using the OnePlus Triggers will require your game to support re-mappable control keys. This is often found in battle royale titles like PUBG Mobile and Call of Duty Mobile. The OnePlus triggers are available only in India for now, and there is no word on the international availability of the triggers yet."
444,Facebook begins testing ads in Instagram Reels,"Facebook will begin adding ads to reels in India, Brazil, Germany and Australia. (File)

Facebook Inc on Thursday said it will begin testing ads on its TikTok clone Instagram Reels in India, Brazil, Germany, and Australia, as the social media giant aims to make money from its short-form video feature.

The company is seeking to capitalize on its popularity in India, a fast-growing social media market, while rival TikTok has been banned from the country since last year. Facebook has said it plans to test other features in India, such as letting content creators share Reels videos on their Facebook accounts.

The introduction of ads is an “indication of how strong the momentum is for Reels,” said Carolyn Everson, vice president of the global business group at Facebook, in an interview. Everson declined to share usage metrics for Reels.

Facebook also announced Thursday it will let advertisers select categories of video content they want to place ads on, such as videos about children and parenting, animals and pets, or fitness and workouts.

The effort is Facebook’s biggest move yet to let brands advertise alongside content subjects. Advertisers typically use Facebook to target certain users by their interests.

“This is a big deal for marketers,” Everson said.

Facebook added it will roll out sticker ads for Facebook Stories in the coming weeks. Brands can create stickers that creators will place in their Stories, and influencers will earn a cut of any sales made through the sticker ads.

The feature is part of Facebook’s push to court content creators who are increasingly making money directly from fans and followers through platforms such as audio chat app Clubhouse and membership site Patreon."

was busy with its product launches and announcements during the Spring Loaded event,

, one of its Taiwan-based suppliers, became a victim of a massive cyberattack in which the

claim to have stolen the blueprints of various Apple gadgets, as per a report by Bloomberg.

The group of hackers calls itself

and is also known by another name: Sodinokibi. As per the report, they declared about the

on a blog on its Dark Web site. The cybercriminals had waited to disclose the hack until Apple’s reveals of its new products during the event.

admitted the ransomware attack, says the report, but didn’t divulge how much data was stolen.

By the time Apple finished with the event, the group of hackers had “posted schematics for a new laptop, including 15 images detailing the guts of what appears to be a

designed as recently as March 2021”, says the report.

REvil claims to have stolen and encrypted “all local network data” and has demanded $50 million for the decryption key that it says would unlock Quanta’s systems. The hackers’ demand for a ransom to retrieve the stolen data was reportedly turned down by Quanta, so they are now trying to hold Apple to ransom. On their blog, they have reportedly asked the tech giant to pay their $50 million ransom by May 1. Until then, they will keep posting “new files” every day."

US tech giant Apple has been the target of a new ransomware attack after a trove of engineering and manufacturing schematics was stolen from Quanta, a Taiwan-based company that is responsible for manufacturing many Apple products including the MacBook laptops. The schematics included current and future products.

A report by The Record suggests that the leak was carried out by Russian hacking group Revil, also known as Sodinokibi. The group apparently demanded a sum of $50 million to not release the schematics. After Quanta refused to comply with the demands of the attackers, the group begun posting the stolen images on April 20, timing the leaks with Apple’s Spring Loaded launch event to send a message.

Now targeting Apple directly, the group is hoping to get the tech giant to pay up by May 1 and threatens to continue posting new images from the leak each day until then.

“Quanta Computer’s information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyberattacks on a small number of Quanta servers,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement to Bloomberg, confirming that its servers were breached.

The company also stated that the hack left no “material impact on the company’s business operation”.

While Apple is yet to clarify the extent of the leak, leaked images from April 20 already suggest the claims could be true. The leaked images contained manufacturing diagrams for Apple’s 2020 M1 MacBook Air as well as schematics for the new iMac design that Apple launched on April 20, among others.

Not REvil’s first attack

The Russian group associated with the attack has targeted other companies before, including laptop manufacturer Acer and cosmetics group Pierre Fabre. However, the Apple attack is the group’s biggest attack yet."
449,"Navalny praises protests, which aides say produced results","In an Instagram post on Thursday, Navalny called people who turned out to protest in his support “the salvation of Russia.”

Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an emotional message from behind bars on Thursday that he felt “pride and hope” after learning from his lawyer about the mass protests demanding his freedom that swept across Russia the previous night.

Meanwhile, Navalny's doctors urged him to “immediately” end a prison hunger strike now in its fourth week “to save his life and health.” And a top aide said Wednesday night’s protests seemed to have brought a compromise from Russian authorities on getting Navalny the medical help he had demanded when launching the hunger strike.

In an Instagram post on Thursday, Navalny called people who turned out to protest in his support “the salvation of Russia.""

The 44-year-old who is President Vladimir Putin's most well-known critic said he hadn't known “what was really happening” outside the prison because he only has access to one TV channel, but his lawyer visited him Thursday and brought him up to speed. “And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.”

“People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything,"" said Navalny. ""They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case.”

Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.

Soon after, a court found that the politician’s stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.

The mass street protests in support of Navalny — which authorities had declared unlawful — swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.

Yet unlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing crowds to swarm streets and squares for hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.

But overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests Wednesday night, with more than 800 in St. Petersburg. While some violent detentions, with police using stun guns, were reported in St. Petersburg, in many cities the demonstrations went on without clashes with law enforcement.

Leonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, noted in the YouTube live stream that the number of arrests was significantly lower than during the nationwide protests in January after Navalny was arrested.

Independent political analyst Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout at Wednesday's protests indicates that the harsh Russian crackdown on previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.

Hundreds were jailed after the January demonstrations and Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.

Navalny’s aides and associates in different Russian regions, in the meantime, were targeted with detentions and raids both before and after Wednesday's protests. Many were jailed, and one was reportedly brutally beaten by police who came to search his apartment.

Gallyamov said this indicated a change of tactics for the authorities, from sweeping crackdowns on all demonstrators to targeting suspected protest leaders.

Last week, Russian authorities took the pressure on Navalny’s allies and supporters to a new level, with the Moscow prosecutor’s office petitioning a court to label as his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist groups. Human rights activists say such a move would paralyze their activities and expose their members and donors to prison sentences of up to 10 years.

Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities’ refusal to let his doctors visit after he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs. But Navalny's doctors said last week that the politician could be near death, as his test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicated impaired kidneys.

Navalny was transferred Sunday from a penal colony east of Moscow to the hospital ward of another prison in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers (110 miles) east of the capital.

On Thursday, Navalny's personal physician Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva released a letter she signed with four other doctors, urging him to end his hunger strike.

The letter revealed that Navalny was taken to a regular hospital Tuesday in Vladimir, where he underwent tests and was examined by specialists “in accordance” with requests from his doctors. It said they were given the results of those tests through Navalny’s lawyers and family on Thursday.

Navalny’s doctors said they would continue to insist on access to their patient — his chief demand in launching his hunger strike — but urged him “to immediately stop the hunger strike in order to save life and health,” saying that they consider being examined by “civilian,” non-prison doctors and undergoing “objective tests” enough to end the strike.

Volkov in a tweet Thursday said the pressure Navalny’s supporters put on the authorities, first by calling a demonstration and then by making it happen, helped achieve this result.

“As soon as the protest was announced, Alexei was taken for a multidisciplinary medical exam to a civilian hospital in Vladimir, and had a large amount of tests. As soon as the protest happened, today, all of a sudden, we were given all the test results.”"
449,"‘Time to do the right thing’ on climate, Greta Thunberg tells U.S. Congress","“I don’t believe for a second that you will actually do this,” she lectured the lawmakers of the House Oversight Committee’s environmental subcommittee.

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg warned U.S. lawmakers Thursday that history will hold them accountable for climate catastrophes if they do not stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry before it is too late.

Thunberg, 18, whose activism has inspired a global movement, testified virtually to a House of Representatives panel on the day President Joe Biden began a virtual two-day Earth Day summit pledging to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030.

“The simple fact, and uncomfortable fact, is that if we are to live up to our promises and commitments in Paris, we have to end fossil fuel subsidies ... now,” Thunberg said, referring to the international 2016 Paris Climate Change Agreement.

The United States under Biden rejoined the Paris agreement in February, after former President Donald Trump pulled out.

Thunberg, whose activism began at age 15 when she started skipping school on Fridays to protest outside the Swedish parliament for climate change, voiced pessimism.

“I don’t believe for a second that you will actually do this,” she lectured the lawmakers of the House Oversight Committee’s environmental subcommittee.

“You still have time to do the right thing and to save your legacies, but that window of time is not going to last for long,” Thunberg said. “We the young people are the ones who are going to write about you in the history books ... So my advice for you is to choose wisely.”

The subcommittee chairman, Representative Ro Khanna, is pressuring Biden, a fellow Democrat, to keep a campaign promise to end fossil fuel subsidies such as tax breaks and regulatory loopholes. “We appreciate that President Biden ran on ending fossil fuel subsidies. But the details matter,” Khanna said in a statement released prior to the hearing.

Khanna asked Thunberg if it would be a “gut punch” to the global environmental movement if fossil fuel subsidies are not eliminated in Biden’s current $2.3 plan to overhaul U.S. infrastructure.

“Yes, pretty much, that’s a good description,” Thunberg replied.

The senior Republican on the subcommittee, Ralph Norman, rejected “doomsday scenarios” about climate. He said children had been greatly affected by the fear of climate change, and asked Thunberg why she had said previously that she wanted people to “panic” about it.

“By that I mean that I want people to step out of their comfort zones, and not just see the climate crisis as a distant threat, but rather as something that is impacting people already today,” Thunberg said.

Thunberg, who was Time magazine’s person of the year in 2019 for her work on climate change, has denounced the “madness” of government subsidies for fossil fuel use. She says pledges by various countries to halve greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade are insufficient.

Biden has called for replacing fossil fuel subsidies with incentives for clean energy production as part of his infrastructure plan, but the plan has not specified which tax breaks for fossil fuel companies would be targeted.

Khanna listed some tax breaks he wants repealed, including one called intangible drilling costs, which allows producers to deduct most costs from drilling new wells."
450,Russia orders troops back after massive drills near Ukraine,"Amid rising tension, units told to return to bases

Russia’s Defence Minister on Thursday ordered troops back to their permanent bases following massive drills in Crimea that involved dozens of Navy ships, hundreds of war planes and thousands of troops in a show of force amid tensions with Ukraine.

After watching the drills, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu declared the manoeuvres over and ordered the military to pull the troops taking part in manoeuvres in Crimea and western Russia back to their permanent bases.

“I consider the goals of the snap check of readiness fulfilled,” Mr. Shoigu said. “The troops have shown their defence capability and I decided to complete the drills in the South and Western military districts.”

He said the troops should return to their bases by May 1, but he also ordered to keep the heavy weapons deployed to western Russia as part of the drills for another massive military exercise later this year.

Mr. Shoigu said they should remain at the Pogonovo firing range in the southwestern Voronezh region. The sprawling range is located 160 kilometers east of the border with Ukraine.

The Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that came amid increasing violations of a ceasefire in Ukraine’s east has raised concerns in the West, which urged the Kremlin to pull its forces back.

The U.S. and NATO has said that the Russian buildup near Ukraine was the largest since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and threw its support behind separatists in eastern Ukraine.

The Russian Defence Ministry said the manoeuvres in Crimea involved more than 60 ships, over 10,000 troops, around 200 aircraft and about 1,200 military vehicles."
450,U.S. general concerned about Afghan security forces after troop withdrawal,"President Joe Biden announced last week that the United States will withdraw its remaining 2,500 troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11

The head of U.S. forces in the Middle East said on Thursday that he was concerned about the ability of the Afghan security forces to hold territory after the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country in the coming months.

President Joe Biden announced last week that the United States will withdraw its remaining 2,500 troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks that triggered America’s longest war.

“My concern is the ability of the Afghan military to hold the ground that they’re on now without the support that they’ve been used to for many years,” Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.

“I am concerned about the ability of the Afghan military to hold on after we leave, the ability of the Afghan Air Force to fly, in particular, after we remove the support for those aircraft,” McKenzie added.

The Pentagon has said it is looking to fund key Afghan military capabilities, including the air force, and seeking to continue paying the salaries of Afghan security forces.

But U.S. officials have long been concerned about corruption in the security forces and questioned how they would be able to hold back Taliban insurgents, which McKenzie said number 50,000, without American air support and intelligence capabilities."
451,A smile ‘worth a million dollars’: Daunte Wright laid to rest after Minnesota police shooting,"Wright, 20, who was shot by a white police officer in a Minneapolis suburb on April 11, is being laid to rest two days after a Minneapolis jury found a white police officer guilty of murdering George Floyd last May.

Hundreds of mourners, wearing face masks and weeping, filled a Minneapolis church on Thursday for the funeral of Daunte Wright, a Black man whose shooting by police after a traffic stop has sparked fresh concerns over the way cops treat people of color.

Wright, 20, who was shot by a white police officer in a Minneapolis suburb on April 11, is being laid to rest two days after a Minneapolis jury found a white police officer guilty of murdering George Floyd last May, a killing that triggered worldwide protests for racial justice.

While the conviction brought a measure of satisfaction to people calling for an end to brutality and racism in policing, Wright’s death served as a reminder of the daily risks facing Black people during encounters with police.

On Thursday, Wright lay in a white casket at center of church, covered in red roses. His family members sat near the front of the church, wiping tears from their faces as an organist played gospel music.

“My son had a smile that was worth a million dollars. When he walked in the room, he lit up the room,” says Katie Wright, Daunte’s mother, who fought through sobs as she spoke from the podium.

Other family members, cousins and siblings, remembered Daunte as “the life of the party” and a father who lived for his beloved two-year-old son Daunte Jr.

His aunt, Naisha Wright, wrote a tribute on a prayer card handed out to attendees, recalling how she playfully nicknamed Daunte “lemon head” and how he would smile.

Wright was a talented basketball player and he particularly loved the Fourth of July, when he would celebrate with his family by lighting fireworks, the prayer card said.

Among the attendees at Shiloh Temple International Ministries, a church with a predominantly Black congregation, were Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, U.S. Senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar and U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, who represents the congressional district encompassing Minneapolis and some of its suburbs.

George Floyd’s family was in attendance, as well as the loved ones of several other Black Americans who were killed: the mother of Philando Castile, the family of Emmett Till, the boyfriend of Breonna Taylor.

‘Not above the law’

The congregation clapped and shouted in enthusiasm at a eulogy given by the Reverend Al Sharpton and opening statements by attorney Ben Crump, who represents Wright’s family after representing many other families of slain Black Americans.

Crump called on Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives with the goal of holding police officers accountable for misconduct.

Both Sharpton and Crump expressed hope that Daunte Wright’s case would get “justice” in the court of law, receiving standing ovations.

“God has turned the page in the state of Minnesota and we are never going back,” Sharpton said, referring to the milestone verdict delivered against former police officer Derek Chauvin, who was found guilty of murdering George Floyd this week.

“The time has come for police to understand that they’re not above the law, they’re to enforce the law,” he said.

Police video of the shooting in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, shows multiple officers attempting to arrest Wright for an outstanding warrant during a routine traffic stop. It then shows Officer Kimberly Potter threatening to stun Wright with her Taser before firing her handgun. A few moments later, she can be heard exclaiming that she shot him. Before he resigned, the city’s police chief Tim Gannon said Potter mistakenly used her gun instead of her Taser.

Potter, who also resigned after the incident, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Potter has not entered a plea and her lawyer, Earl Gray, has not commented about the case.

The shooting of Wright set off more than a week of demonstrations outside the Brooklyn Center police headquarters that turned violent at times, with some protesters hurling objects and the police using tear gas and less-lethal rounds."
451,U.K. apologizes for racism in memorials to WWI dead,"An investigation found that African and Indian service members were either not commemorated by name or weren’t commemorated at all, according to a report commissioned by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

British authorities apologized Thursday after an investigation found that at least 161,000 mostly African and Indian military service personnel who died during World War I weren’t properly honoured due to “pervasive racism.” It said that number could possibly range up to 350,000.

The investigation found that those service members were either not commemorated by name or weren’t commemorated at all, according to a report commissioned by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Between 45,000 and 54,000 other casualties were “commemorated unequally.”

The treatment of these soldiers, who served in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, contrasts with that of the men and women who died in Europe. It also violates the principle that all war dead should be remembered in the same way because they all made the same enormous sacrifice.

“On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government, both of the time and today, I want to apologize for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation,” Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in the House of Commons. “Whilst we can’t change the past, we can make amends and take action.”

The commission was created in 1917 to ensure that all who died in the service of the British Empire during World War I were identified and properly honored. Its responsibilities were later expanded to include those who died during World War II, and it now oversees the graves of 1.7 million men and women who died during the two wars.

The commission appointed an independent panel to investigate claims of unequal treatment following a 2019 TV documentary presented by David Lammy, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, that focused on the way African casualties were commemorated. One researcher who worked on the documentary said she had forwarded information about her concerns to the commission more than a decade earlier but no action was taken.

The investigation found that tens of thousands of service personnel who died in Africa, Asia and the Middle East either weren’t commemorated at all or were only honored anonymously on collective memorials. Others had their names recorded on paper registers rather than stone monuments. The battlefield graves of thousands more were abandoned without the remains ever being identified.

In Europe, the commission attempted to identify all of the dead and bury their remains under identical white headstones that still dot cemeteries from France to Turkey. The names of those who couldn’t be identified were recorded on mass memorials.

“No apology can ever make up for the indignity suffered by the unremembered,″ Lammy said. “However, this apology does offer the opportunity for us as a nation to work through this ugly part of our history — and properly pay our respects to every soldier who has sacrificed their life for us.”

David Olusoga, a professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said World War I changed British culture, in part because of the powerful way that the dead were remembered.

“(Yet) when it came to men who were black and brown and Asian and African, it is not equal. Particularly the Africans, who have been treated in a way that is … apartheid in death,″ he told the BBC. “It is an absolute scandal.”

The inequality was rooted in the “imperial ideology” of British and colonial authorities in the years immediately after World War I, the investigation found. For instance, the officer in charge of graves registration in East Africa asserted that central memorials were the most appropriate way to commemorate the dead because most Africans “do not attach any sentiment” to the graves of their dead.

“Sweeping judgements such as these, which chose to ignore the intricacies of faith, culture and customs in Africa outside Christian and Islamic traditions, played a significant role in shaping the (commission’s) policies that led to unequal treatment,” the panel said.

These attitudes were adopted at the highest levels of the British government. Winston Churchill, then-Secretary of State for the Colonies, in 1921 signed a document directing that collective memorials, rather than individual headstones, should be erected for African troops in Africa.

In response to the panel’s findings, the commission said it would continue to search for the names of African, Asian and Middle Eastern casualties and add their names to its records. It also promised to be more flexible in the evidence required to support requests for commemoration in light of the panel’s concerns about the availability of paper records.

The commission also said it would improve transparency about this issue on its website and set up an expert panel to advise it.

“We apologize unreservedly for the historical wrongs found in this report and for failing to live up to founding principle, of `equality of treatment in death,’” the commission said."
452,Biden to propose raising taxes on wealthy and on capital gains to fund childcare,"Any such hike would need to go through Congress, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds narrow majorities and is unlikely to win support from Republicans.

President Joe Biden will roll out a plan to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and their investments to fund about $1 trillion in childcare, universal pre-kindergarten education and paid leave for workers, sources familiar with the proposal said.

The plan, part of the White House’s push for a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. tax system to make the rich and big companies pay more, calls for increasing the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and nearly doubling taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million, according to the sources this week.

That would be the highest tax rate on capital gains taxes, which are mostly paid by the top 1% of Americans, since the tax was introduced in 1913.

News of the proposal triggered sharp declines on Wall Street, with the benchmark S&P 500 index down 1% in early afternoon, its steepest drop in more than a month.

Any such hike would need to go through Congress, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds narrow majorities and is unlikely to win support from Republicans.

“If it had a chance of passing, we’d be down 2,000 points,” said Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at hedge fund Great Hill Capital LLC, referring to stock market indexes.

Sources said details would be released next week before Biden’s address to Congress. Tax details related to the plan, which has been in the works for months, were first reported by the New York Times on Thursday morning.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the president would discuss his “American Families Plan” during his speech to Congress next Wednesday, but declined to comment on any details.

She said the administration had not yet finalized funding plans, but stressed Biden’s determination to make the wealthy and companies pay for new programs.

“His view is that that should be on the backs - that can be on the backs of the wealthiest Americans who can afford it and corporations and businesses who can afford it,” Psaki said.

She said Biden and his economic team did not believe the measures would have a negative impact on investment in the United States.

Yields on Treasuries, which move in the opposite direction to their price, fell to the day’s low.

Capital gains

Biden’s new plan, likely to cost about $1 trillion, comes after a $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure proposal that has already run into stiff opposition from Republicans. They generally support funding infrastructure projects but oppose Biden’s inclusion of priorities like expanding eldercare and asking corporate America to pay the tab.

Tax hikes on the wealthy could harden Republicans’ resistance against Biden’s latest “human” infrastructure plan, forcing Democrats to consider pushing it - or least some of the measures - through Congress using a party-line budget vote known as reconciliation.

Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who wields outsize power due to the party’s slim majority, said recently said he was wary of expanding the use of reconciliation.

Wealthy Americans could face an overall capital gains tax rate of 43.4% including the 3.8% net investment tax on individuals with income of $200,000 or more ($250,000 married filing jointly). The latter helps fund the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.

Currently, those earning more than $200,000 pay an overall rate of about 23.8% including the Obamacare net investment tax instituted as part of that law."

457,Covid second wave: Mixed reaction to postponement of JEE (Main) April session,"The postponement of the JEE Main 2021 April session last week due to the second wave of coronavirus has left a section of students in a quandary. Two sessions of JEE Main – one in February and the other in March – have already been conducted. A total of 6,19,638 and 6,52,627 candidates had registered for February and March sessions, respectively.

Most students who took their first shot at the entrance exam conducted during the first quarter of 2021, however, seem to be relieved for several reasons.

Utkarsh Singh, 17, from Madhya Pradesh, appeared for both February and March sessions. His best of two scores was 99.96 percentile.

“Board exams have also been rescheduled and we are not sure under which circumstance we will have to take these exams. To appear for JEE Main amid all this confusion would have added to the pressure and hampered my performance. Since I am satisfied with my performance, I can focus completely on JEE Advanced preparations,” said Utkarsh.

Shivashish Sharma,18, agrees and says that waiting indefinitely for the exam schedule to release leads to loss of motivation. He too appeared for both the sessions and achieved 99.88 percentile.

“Though I will appear for all the four sessions, I am mentally relieved because I am confident of qualifying for JEE Advanced with the score I achieved. The major cause of concern is for those who were only eyeing the April session,” said Shivashish, who is a class 12 student at Pragati Public School, Delhi.

On the other hand, some candidates feel that students who are planning to give their best shot in April will have things working in their favour.

Shashank Shah, a class 12 student of Paramount International School, Delhi, believes that such students will get more time to prepare and perform better.

“Since the April session and board exams are already postponed, students have a lot of time to master the concepts, practice more and revise all the topics multiple times. These students will have an advantage as class 12 classes have also been concluded and they can solely focus on entrance exam preparations,” adds Shashank, whose best of two scores is 75 percentile.

Amit Ahuja, career counsellor, Allen Career Institute, Kota, says, “Aspirants put their efforts throughout the year or even a couple of years to prepare for JEE Main. Any extra time due to postponement does not impact the performance of diligent candidates. However, those who did not secure high marks can take this time to boost their preparations to achieve the desired score in April or May sessions.”

Gargi Jain, 18, from Vidisha district in Madhya Pradesh, feels that students will have too many things to handle and it can adversely affect their performance.

“Boards, JEE Main and JEE Advanced, candidates will have to appear for all these exams when the global pandemic is at its peak. Along with academics, students will also have a lot of psychological pressure,” she adds."

However, concerned about losing out on the academic schedule, most students said they had to “forcefully consent” to the varsity’s decision but various other departments asking them to vacate hostels have now become a new challenge for many.

One such student, Dayanand, who hails from Tumkur said, “Many students like me from other districts and even states have been asked to vacate the hostels. Despite taking the risk to attend the exams amid the pandemic, none has come forward to help us see through this tough period of time.”

He also expressed his helplessness to find an alternative place as he had no relatives or friends who could offer a place to stay because of the ongoing pandemic crisis. “We have been psychologically strained by all means for being forcefully consented to take these exams risking our lives. Where will we go now,” he gasped.

Meanwhile, Mustak, a native of Chitradurga who studies in a college in Bengaluru said, “There has been hardly any social distancing measures in place at colleges even as big announcements about SOPs (standard operating procedures) and CAB (Covid-appropriate behaviour) were made repeatedly. We are pursuing a course that needs to be completed on time for placements but it is really distressing to see the government not doing anything for our safety.”

He added, “We humbly request the authorities to consider our lives too, during this pandemic time and take an appropriate decision to either postpone the remaining exams or to at least allow us to stay in hostels till the exams get over.”

Echoing the students’ demands, the All India Democratic Students Association (AIDSO) condemned the attitude of the authorities alleging mismanagement and lack of coordination among departments such as Higher Education (in charge of universities), and Social Welfare (in charge of government hostels).

“Students are being forced in many hostels to immediately leave to their natives. Several students have exams tomorrow they do not know what to do. The government should take a responsible decision soon,” Ashwini K S, AIDSO state president said.

Meanwhile, senior officials from the Social Welfare Department confirmed that the order was issued purely based on orders from the Chief Secretary to do so, in line with the restrictions announced across the state till May 4.

“We have been getting calls from our district officers pointing out the grievances raised by the students. A discussion will be held on Friday morning with the in-charge Social Welfare Commissioner as soon as he takes charge. Further orders will be issued as per the decisions taken then,” P Nagesh, Deputy Director (Education), from the department told Indianexpress.com.

We hope to take a student-friendly decision, but we also need to adhere to the orders issued by our higher-ups in this regard.” The official added that Social Welfare Commissioner was on leave for 15 days and hence an in-charge Commissioner had to be deputed to take such calls."
458,CBSE introduces changes in assessment and evaluation practices for 2021-22 session,"After announcing the postponement of class 12 board exams and cancellation of class 10 exams, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to put greater emphasis on competency-based education (CBE).

The board is initiating changes in the examination and assessment practices for the year 2021-22. While the overall marks and duration of examination shall remain the same, a greater number of competency-based questions or questions that assess the application of concepts in real-life/ unfamiliar situations will be part of the question paper.

“The pandemic has exposed the education system to various challenges and opportunities. We are trying to shift the focus from assessment of learning to assessment for learning. Students must be equipped with the ability to solve problems and assessment must shift from testing primarily rote memorisation skills to one that is more formative, is more competency-based, promotes learning and development for our students, and tests higher-order skills, such as analysis, critical thinking, and conceptual clarity,” Biswajit Saha, director, Training and Skill Development, CBSE, told indianexpress.com.

As per the revised scheme, there will be 20 per cent competency-based questions and 20 per cent objective questions for class 11 and 12 as compared to 20 per cent objective-type questions. Competency-based questions can be in the form of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), case-based questions, source-based integrated questions or any other type. Presently, 70 per cent of questions are short answer/ long answer type but now it will be reduced to 60 per cent.

“The race for completing the syllabus and achieving the highest marks is still visible in our system. We have changed the pattern for class 9-12 as most schools use a similar evaluation strategy for performance analysis for class 1-8. There will be ripple effects of the move and the system is expected to change positively over time and competency-based education will become the prime focus,” Saha added.

For class 9-10, a minimum of 30 per cent will be competency-based questions, objective questions will be 20 per cent and the remaining 50 per cent short answer/ long answer type questions. As per the current scheme, class 10 question papers have 20 per cent objective-type questions, 20 per cent case-based/source- based integrated questions 20 per cent and 60 per cent short answer/ long answer-type questions.

The board had earlier announced the class 10 exams 2021 have been cancelled and the students will be assessed based on objective criteria, which is under process at the moment. Meanwhile, class 12 have been rescheduled and the new datesheet will be announced once the situation pertaining to COVID-19 improves across the country."

Lack of clarity about the examination timeline seems to be the biggest concern among students and tutors.

With Covid-19 cases rising every day, it is unlikely that these national-level examinations can be conducted anytime soon. The only silver lining, some say, is the additional time students now have to continue preparations.

“Though students could feel irritated now, on the bright side, they have additional time to study,” said Durgesh Mangeshkar, director, IITian’s Prashikshan Kendra

Offering a similar view, Lalit Kumar, founder and director, Prime Academy, said, “Students must prepare a list of topics, based on their importance, and use this golden opportunity to better prepare.” “Students must remain focused on studies despite the rescheduled exam dates,” added Kumar.

Sumita Ravi, parent of a class XII student in the city, said examinations must not be conducted before the situation improves. “Students must at least be told they won’t have to take an exam before date…” she said.

Pranav Kumar Jha, an NET aspirant, said the postponement will give him more time to focus on preparations. He is a postgraduate in chemistry from Nagpur.

“Every exam requires a designated method of preparation. If all agencies and institutions conducting examinations, be it the boards or entrances, can jointly come up with comprehensive details offering a timeline of the examinations, it will help students accordingly plan their studies in the coming weeks,” said Mangeshkar.

Though there is no decision yet on the upcoming JEE exams scheduled in May, tutors suggest that the remaining exams be combined."
460,Maharashtra state-run universities to conduct examinations online,"Several exams of Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, and Gondwana universities had already been conducted online earlier.

Examinations for undergraduate students of 13 state-run universities in Maharashtra will be held online, state minister Uday Samant said on Thursday. Speaking to reporters, the minister for higher and technical education said that he also plans to request the state government to include exam-related work in the essential services category.

“There are strict restrictions imposed to break the chain of the COVID-19 spread in the state. Hence, we have decided to conduct examinations for undergraduate students, from first to third year, online,” Samant said.

The minister said he will also request the state administration to include some exam-related works in the essential services category. The decision has been taken after consulting vice-chancellors of universities, he said.

Several exams of Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, and Gondwana universities had already been conducted online earlier, he said.

“We are also trying to inoculate students in the age group of 18 to 25 years. There are some 37 lakh students in all these universities who can be vaccinated at their respective institutions,” Samant said, adding that final decision in this regard is yet to be taken."
461,IIM-Ahmedabad virtually inaugurates 16th batch of the MBA-PGPX programme,"Professor Viswanath Pingali, Chairperson, MBA-PGPX addresses the students of the 16th batch of IIMA's MBA-PGPX Programme

The Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) today announced the commencement of the 16th batch of the MBA-PGPX programme virtually due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. The MBA-PGPX is a one-year full-time residential Post Graduate Programme in Management for Executives.

The MBA-PGPX programme is designed to enable high performing professionals to accelerate their growth to leadership positions, as well as entrepreneurs to scale up and expand their business ventures.

Viswanath Pingali, Chairperson, MBA-PGPX said, “The world is in need of visionaries and leaders, who understand the changing dynamics of the industry, and are equipped to harness these changes in leading their organisations successfully.

466,"Bengal polls: EC bans physical campaigning, expresses ‘anguish’ over flouting of Covid norms","The Election Commission (EC) on Thursday banned roadshows, vehicle rallies, and public meetings of more than 500 people in West Bengal, noting that political parties and candidates were “still not adhering to the prescribed safety norms” during campaigning.

Permissions already given for such events stood withdrawn, the Commission said.

The directive came hours after Calcutta High Court censured the EC for not doing enough to ensure that political parties were following appropriate Covid-19 protocols amid the devastating second wave of infections.

“We are unable to reconcile the fact that the Election Commission of India is not able to update us as to what action by way of enforcement of the circulars has been obtained,” a Bench of Chief Justice Thottathil B Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee said.

“Issuance of circulars and holding of meetings by themselves do not discharge the onerous responsibility of the Election Commission of India…in due performance of not only the statutory power and authority under the Representation of People Act…but the confidence that the Indian polity would have on it to carry forward the mechanism of upholding the democracy by use of requisite facilities even in pandemic times…,” the court said.

West Bengal reported a record 11,948 new cases of coronavirus infection in the 24 hours up to Thursday evening. The active caseload in the state is now 68,798. Fifty-six people have died in the 24 hours up to Thursday, the state government said in its daily Covid-19 bulletin.

Asked why the Commission had continued to permit gatherings of up to 500 people and not banned campaigning altogether, a senior official told The Indian Express: “We can’t impose a ban on campaigning since people in the state are free to move around even today.

“The cap of 500 people will encourage parties to hold more virtual rallies, which could be relayed to smaller gatherings as opposed to lakhs meeting at one place for a physical rally,” the official said.

The order noted the Commission was “anguished” that candidates and parties were refusing to follow Covid-19 protocols, making it difficult for the state and district election machinery to enforce the poll body’s directions properly.

The Commission’s state machinery is learned to have issued show cause notices to parties and candidates, and filed cases under the NDMA Act on Thursday for violation of Covid safety protocols during campaigning. According to sources, two notices were issued to the BJP for violations in North 24-Parganas district, and one each to the TMC, BJP, and Congress in Malda district.

Thirteen cases have been filed under section 51(B) of NDMA Act for violation of protocols in Birbhum district, of which two each are against the BJP and TMC, and one each against the Congress and CPM, the sources said.

Soon after the EC order, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee cancelled all her scheduled meetings.

“In the wake of upsurge in #COVID19 cases across the country and the ECI Order dated 22nd April, 2021, I am cancelling all my prescheduled meetings and we will reach out to the people virtually. We will be sharing the updated schedule of the virtual meetings shortly,” she said in a tweet.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had cancelled all his public meetings in Bengal on Friday. Modi will instead address the people of Bengal virtually.

On Monday, the BJP said that it would not hold any meeting with more than 500 people, including those addressed by Modi.

The sixth phase of voting in the state took place on Thursday. Two more phases are scheduled for April 26 and April 29. Votes will be counted on May 2.

The High Court was hearing three petitions that contended that the EC had no power to implement pandemic guidelines in the conduct of elections, and that the court should, therefore, step in.

During the last hearing on Tuesday, the court had perused an affidavit by the Chief Electoral Officer, West Bengal, which submitted that “the Commission has made it clear by its Circular dated 09.04.2021…that in case of breach of strict observance of Covid Protocols during election rallies, meetings, campaigning etc. the Commission will not hesitate in banning public meetings, rallies of the defaulting candidate/star campaigners/political leaders”.

This submission, the court had said in its order on Tuesday, “obviously means that the Chief Election Commission and the Chief Electoral Officer will be at liberty to utilise such Government officials and police force as may be necessary to ensure strict compliance with its guidelines in public domain”.

On Thursday, the court observed that “We are not satisfied with the materials on record to state that the Election Commission of India and its officers on ground in West Bengal have enforced their circulars.”

It underlined that “circulars are not merely advisories to be wrapped up by the political parties or those involved in the political propaganda or even the public at large”.

Rather, the EC’s circulars “show the route map and the protocol for human behaviour, meaning thereby the behaviour of the political parties, their workers, the people at large and responsible management by the officers including the police and other forces under the command of the Election Commission of India”, the court said.

The court directed the EC to make “submissions with a very short affidavit reflecting on whatever we have stated”. Given the urgency of the matter, the court posted it “as the first item tomorrow” (Friday)."
466,Dissatisfied with measures for polls amid Covid surge: Calcutta HC raps ECI,"The Calcutta high court on Thursday expressed dissatisfaction over measures taken by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to enforce Covid-19 safety norms in campaigning for the ongoing West Bengal assembly polls.This comes at a time when the state is struggling with a record number of infections and the daily count of Covid-19 cases breaching the 10,000-mark, at least 50 times what it was on February 26, when the election dates were announced.“Issuance of circulars and holding of meetings by themselves do not discharge the onerous responsibility of the ECI and officers under its command,” the court said.On April 13, the court had directed the state’s chief electoral officer and district magistrates to ‘strictly’ implement the Covid-19 guidelines during political campaigns. But the HC was unhappy with the steps taken to enforce norms.“We are not satisfied with the materials on record to state that the ECI have enforced their circulars,” the court said.The eight-phase assembly polls in West Bengal started on March 27 and the sixth round ended on Thursday. Experts have linked the exponential rise in cases to mask-less rallies where hundreds of people jostled with each other, in violation of distancing guidelines.Last week, ECI banned campaigning between 7 pm and 10 am, increased the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours for the last three phases and warned political parties to strictly adhere to Covid guidelines.Nearly all parties have imposed restrictions on their election campaigns.“The ECI should wrap up the poll process at the earliest. The lengthier the election process the higher would be the toll. We need all handson deck to fight the crisis. All safety protocols have taken a back seat in the elections rallies as a result of which, the cases are rising,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state."
466,"EC bans roadshows, restricts size of gatherings in Bengal","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday banned cycle or motorbike rallies, padyatras and limited public events to 500 people for the remaining two phases of the West Bengal elections, saying political parties had flouted Covid norms despite an alarming spike in infections.The order came with roughly four days left for campaigning in the eight-phase polls and critical remarks by the Calcutta high court on the poll panel’s enforcement of Covid guidelines.“The commission has noted with anguish that many political parties/candidates are still not adhering to prescribed safety norms during public gatherings and this is making it difficult for the state/district election machineries to enforce the aforesaid directions fully,” ECI said in its order.“Therefore… in addition to the Commission’s earlier orders… with effect from 7pm of April 22, no roadshows/padyatras… cycle/bike/vehicle rallies will be permissible. No public meetings beyond the limit of 500 people… (with) adequate social distancing shall be permissible,” the order added.Since late February, when the elections were announced, daily Covid cases have increased in the state at least 50 times, according to official figures. On Thursday, the state posted XXX cases and xxx deaths. Experts link the spike to mask-less rallies where thousands of people jostle with each other in violation of social distancing guidelines.The commission revoked any prior permissions granted for political events. Forty-three seats across Bengal voted in the sixth phase on Thursday. The seventh and the eighth phases, for 34 and 35 seats, respectively, will be held on April 26 and 29.Last week, ECI banned campaigning between 7 pm and 10 am, increased the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours for the last three phases and warned political parties to strictly adhere to Covid guidelines.Nearly all parties have imposed restrictions on their election campaigns. Prime Minister Narendra Modi cancelled his events in the state on Thursday to chair a high-level meeting to assess the gravity of the Covid-19 situation.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has scaled back public events to 500 people, while Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee has decided to campaign only virtually. On Sunday, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi called off his public events in the state.The Commission received requests from TMC to clubbing the last phases of the polls but said on Wednesday that merging the rounds was not feasible under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. In two separate orders issued earlier, the commission also warned political parties of strict action in case the safety norms were flouted.TMC’s Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien severely criticised the WHICH decision. “The EC does not even pretend it’s independent anymore. Not a fig leaf of pretence. Beyond Extensively Compromised,” he said. TMC said the poll panel took the decision only after the PM cancelled his meetings in the state.Former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi said the decision was better late than never. “It’s a good step,” he said. “They could have taken the step earlier as well to contain the spread of Covid-19 as the consequences of the crowds are for everyone to see.”"
466,"PM Modi, Mamata Banerjee go virtual after EC restricts campaigning in Bengal","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee late on Thursday evening decided to carry out virtual campaigns for the remaining two phases of assembly polls after the Election Commission (EC) issued fresh restrictions on assembly of people in the wake of the sharp spike in coronavirus infections in West Bengal.
